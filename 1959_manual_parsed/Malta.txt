MALTA, G.C.

Area

The total area is 122 square miles made up of the three main islands as follows: Malta 94·876 square miles, Gozo 25·899 square miles and Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are mere islets.

Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1957 was 34° F. recorded on the 3rd March, while the highest, 106° F., occurred on the 10th August. The mean annual temperature is 66° F. and the mean annual rainfall is 23 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12th June, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

Constitution

The Constitution introduced in 1947 is contained in the Malta (Constitution) Letters Patent, 1947, the Royal Instructions issued on the 5th September, 1947, and the Malta (Office of Governor) Letters Patent, 1947. Provision is made under the Constitution Letters Patent for a Legislative Assembly of 40 members elected by universal suffrage under the proportional representation system. Under the Constitution the Prime Minister and not more than seven other Ministers are appointed by the Governor. The Executive Council comprises the Governor and the Ministers. Legislative and administrative powers in regard to certain matters, principally defence and foreign affairs, are reserved to the Governor who is advised by the Nominated Council which consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legal Secretary and the Heads of the three Services in Malta. There is also a Privy Council which consists of the Executive Council and the Nominated Council sitting together. English and Maltese are the official languages.

Following the resignation of Mr. Mintoff's Government on the 24th April, 1958, a State of Emergency was declared in Malta on the 30th April, 1958, primarily to enable the Governor to continue the administration of Government in the absence of Ministers.

Work has begun on the construction of a deep-water harbour to facilitate the handling of commercial traffic, and plans have been drawn up for the construction of a grain silo and a modern customs shed at the Grand Harbour, Valletta. Comprehensive “Aids
to Industries" legislation is in course of preparation which is intended to provide inducements for new industries, such as exemption from income tax and customs duties and grants and loans from Government. Meanwhile an industrial estate is being laid out, and the first two factories are being built. Simultaneously with the expansion of the Electricity Power Station, gas supplies are being improved by the installation of a new oil gasification plant and a liquid gas bottling plant. Agreement was reached last year with an Oil Company on the terms of grant for oil prospecting and mining rights. For the first time in the Island's history a Malta Government Tourist Board, with full executive powers, has been established. It is implementing many plans for tourism, such as development of the Island's beaches and other tourist amenities.

Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Primary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 113 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction, with an enrolment of 55,515 pupils; and six Grammar schools with some 2,644 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1769, has an average attendance of 283 students and grants degrees in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts and science.

Communications

The international airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station. There are other service airfields at Hal Far and Ta Qali. British European Airways operate the following services:—(a) three services daily to London via Ajaccio or Naples and/or Rome and/or Nice; (b) five services a week to Catania; (c) daily services to Tripoli, and (d) three services a week to Tripoli and Benghazi. In addition there are the following coach class services from Malta: (a) a freight service by Hunting Clan Air Transport Limited from London via Frankfurt-Rome-Malta-Central Africa, and (b) to Cyprus by Skysways Limited once every week. During 1957, 3,704 aircraft off-loaded 29,202 passengers while 3,699 aircraft took off 29,947 passengers; 36,720 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of the Island does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Five miles of road at present surfaced with sheet asphalt will be completely resurfaced in the very near future. Bitmac is now being used as a surface dressing and the length of roads thus covered is six miles. 418 miles of streets and roads have been surfaced with full asphalt grouting and
semi-grouting which is still the standard method of road surface treatment. The length of roads in dry macadam is 75 miles.

The chief port is the Grand Harbour, which in 1957 handled 1,620 steamships of a total tonnage of 2,452,747 and 253 sailing vessels with a total of 16,355 tons. There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a service calling at Naples, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Malta and Tripoli, every five days, and the Laferla shipping line four times a week between Malta and Syracuse. A ferry service running between Marfa and Mgarr links the two Islands of Malta and Gozo.

Broadcasting

There are no broadcasting stations in Malta. The number of licences for wireless receiving sets on 31st July, 1958, was, however, 13,441. Messrs. Broadcast Relay Service (Malta) Limited operate a wired broadcasting station situated at Hamrun. The number of subscribers is 42,810.

A broadcasting commission to organize political broadcasting has been set up.

Principal Occupations

The gainfully-occupied population (85,140) was engaged in 1957 in the following occupations: agriculture (7,570), fishing (840), stone quarrying and clay pits (470), manufacturing and mechanical (8,670) construction (4,950), commerce (11,220), communications (3,780), community, recreation and personal services (7,560), Government (16,970), dockyard and Service Departments, including local servicemen (23,110).

During 1957, 18,004 cwt. of fish were landed by local fishermen (mainly during the months between May and November) with a wholesale value of £168,285.

Malta has to import nearly all the raw materials required for industry. A leading United Kingdom Company is, however, carrying out exploration (deep test drilling) for oil.

There are no heavy industries in the islands, but a growing number of light industries produce macaroni, canned fruits, flour, tomato-paste, beer, wine, squashes and soft drinks, cigars and cigarettes, smokers' pipes and accessories, matches, pyjamas and shirts, edible oil, footwear, handbags and suitcases, furniture, cement tiles, marble works, bituminous emulsions, basket ware, candles, crown corks, gloves, mirrors, homespun cloth, buttons, tanned leather, lace, gold and silver filigree work, hosiery, nails and screws, and textiles.

The Government currently grants exclusive rights to produce goods under the provisions of the Encouragement of New Industries Act (see also section above on Development Plans).
