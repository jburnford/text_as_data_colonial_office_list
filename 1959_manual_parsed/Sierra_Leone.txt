SIERRA LEONE

Area

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925, South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

Population

The latest estimate of population was 2,260,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 2,130,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asians, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

Estimated Population

| Kenema, S.E. Province    | 6,300      |
| Makeni, N. Province      | 7,500      |

Geographical Features

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

Climate

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground.
Most of the rain falls in the three months July–September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10°, inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.

**History**

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

**Constitution**

That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

The Sierra Leone (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, provides for an Executive Council consisting of the Governor as President, a Premier and not less than seven other Ministers. Like the Premier, they are appointed from the Elected Members of the House of Representatives.

The same Order in Council provides for a House of Representatives consisting of a Speaker, 51 elected members and two nominated members, the last to have no voting powers. Of the 51 elected members, 14 represent Freetown and the Colony area, 25 represent Electoral Districts in the Protectorate, and the remaining 12 are Paramount Chiefs elected by the 12 District Councils in the Protectorate. Elections to the new House on a franchise extended to include virtually all adult males and all adult female taxpayers or property owners, were held in May 1957 and the House met for the first time in July 1957.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

**Taxation**

There are three forms of direct taxation in force: income tax, poll tax, and local tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief; there are allowances for children (up to four) up to the age of 16 years or so long as they are receiving whole-time education; and for life assurance premiums up to certain limits. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. A double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government.

Poll tax is payable by non-natives at the rate of £4 a year and is offset against individual liability for income tax. A Local Tax Ordinance introduced in 1954 replaces the House Tax, formerly paid by all adult native males, by a Local Tax. This is at present subject to a maximum of 25s. per head, and within chiefdoms is paid at a fixed rate. In general terms payment applies to all adult male persons residing in each chiefdom and in certain cases to adult females also. Revenue from this tax is divided between District Councils and Native Administrations.

The main form of indirect taxation is the Customs tariff.

In 1957, £5,887,967 of total revenue was derived from Customs and £2,320,109 from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

Development Schemes £773,251, Medical and Education Services £1,964,125, Public Works and Electricity recurrent £1,163,760, non-recurrent Public Works £469,646, Law and Order £763,447, Provincial Administration and the Secretariat £224,002.

The Public Debt at the end of December 1957 amounted to £5,660,582.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100 Sh., 20 Sh. and 10 Sh.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2 Sh., 1 Sh. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946 (and reviewed in 1949 when "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was published). The Plans provided for the development of Communications, Natural Resources and Social and Basic Services at a total cost of £5,000,000 in the ten-year period.

As contributions towards this expenditure, allocations of £2,600,000 and £1,200,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts of 1945 and 1955 were made.

The amount which it is expected to spend on development (largely on works construction) in the period 1st January 1958 to 31st December 1960 is £11,530,576 made up as follows:

- Lungi Airport: £90,896
- Inland Waterways: £40,000
- Freetown Electricity Supply: £446,029
- Provincial Electricity Supplies: £99,856
- Provincial Water Supplies: £323,214
- Roads and Bridges: £2,493,601
- Railway and Port Development: £2,005,770
- Guma Valley Hydro-electric Scheme: £1,463,209
- Agriculture: £716,276
- Schools and Colleges: £1,557,213
- Hospitals and Clinics: £298,516
- Public Buildings and Housing Schemes: £1,860,040
- Fisheries Research: £43,556
- Forest Industries: £43,000
- Broadcasting: £45,000
- Geological Survey: £4,400

Total: £11,530,576

It is hoped to finance this programme from loan funds, the Sierra Leone Development and Education Funds, and from the territory's allocations under the 1945 and 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

Education

University courses in Divinity, Arts, Science, Commerce and Education are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown. At the beginning of the 1957–58 session, 265 students were in attendance at these courses and, apart from scholarships for secondary education and teacher training, 85 scholarships were awarded, 57 for higher education, including study overseas. About 14 students were known to be studying in the U.S.A.

There are five Teacher Training Colleges and one Teacher Training Department in the territory; 620 students were in training in 1957.

There are seven Government secondary schools and 15 assisted secondary schools in which 5,356 pupils were enrolled in 1957. There are also two unassisted secondary schools which had 568 pupils. Five Government, 465 assisted and 27 unassisted primary schools had an enrolment of 61,881 pupils.

The Technical Institute, Freetown, which opened in 1953, and the Technical Institute, Kenema, which opened in 1956, had 803 students in 1957 enrolled in engineering, carpentry, commercial and other technical and vocational courses.

Literacy campaigns were conducted in 1957 by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in 26 chiefdoms, and 727 reading certificates were issued. The Bureau reported that in ten years 11,020 people were estimated to have attained literacy in one vernacular, while 309,919 books in five vernaculars (Mende, Temne, Limba, Kono, and Koranko), had been sold, 156,080 of them within the last five years of the period.

The Extramural Department of Fourah Bay College, the British Council and the Social Development Department organized adult education courses in various subjects.

Expenditure on education, other than under the Development Plan, was £1,110,378 in 1957. In 1935 total expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Libraries

Fourah Bay College has a library of some 20,000 volumes. The British Council maintains a subscription library of over 25,800 books and makes regular bulk loans of books and periodicals to the Protectorate. In Freetown there are also two small public libraries.

Health

Diseases contended with in Sierra Leone, in addition to such infections as typhoid and dysentery, which are common, include malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy, tuberculosis, goitre, rabies, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, smallpox, cerebro-spinal fever and yaws. The incidence of the last five is comparatively low. The Health Service includes an Endemic Diseases Control Unit, an Entomological Laboratory and the former Malaria Control Unit.

In 1957 beds available in hospitals (including two Infirmarys and a maternity hospital) totalled 1,476 (Government 1,101, Missions 280, Mining 95). In-patients at Government Hospitals numbered 17,291 and out-patients 239,445.
were 39 Government dispensaries and Health Centres (excluding 25 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) at which 137,455 new cases were treated.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1957 was £813,040. By comparison actual expenditure in 1935 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the only international airport in the territory and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Air Services are operated through Freetown Airport by Air France, Hunting-Clan/Airwork Services and West African Airways Corporation. They connect Sierra Leone to other parts of West Africa and provide six services a week to and from the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.

Air and marine navigational aids, and aeradio and meteorological radio services, are also provided.

The railway carried 1,438,313 passengers and 127,282 tons of freight in 1957. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 339. This mileage included a branch line covering a distance of 83½ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 37½ miles.

There are 3,172 miles of road, 1,594 miles of first class roads maintained by the Public Works Department and 1,578 miles of roads maintained by local Government bodies and private companies.

Freetown, a port of British Shipping Registry, has anchorage room for 240 ships of unrestricted draught and berths for three ships alongside the new Queen Elizabeth II Quay, which is 1,250 feet long with a depth of 32 feet of water at Mean Low Water Ordinary Springs. Oil bunkers can now be obtained by ships alongside the Quay, and ships also berth alongside the nearby Kissy Oil Jetty for oil bunkers, or to discharge various types of fuel into the Oil Storage Company's tanks. Smaller ports are at Pepel, Bonthe and Sulima. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines; Bonthe and Sulima are loading ports for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and Palm Line, Limited, and to the Continent by Holland West Africa Line. A limited cargo service to the east coast ports of America is provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and the Barber Steamship Lines, and to South Africa by J. P. Holmen, Limited, and Elder Dempster Lines, Limited.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

Broadcasting

The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service, transmitting from Freetown, was inaugurated in 1955 and at present operates from 6·45 to 8·00 a.m. and 4·45 to 10·00 p.m. on the frequency of 3,316 kilocycles in the 90 metre band with a power of 5 kilowatts. The Service consists of approximately 4½ hours' local programme and the remainder re-radiated B.B.C. Overseas Service.

The Department of Broadcasting came into being on 1st January, 1958, the programme side of the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service having broken away from the former Public Relations (now Information) Department. The transmitters are shortly to be taken over from Posts and Telecommunications Department. Completely new Studio equipment will be installed early in 1959 under a recently appointed Chief Engineer. It is planned to re-site the transmitters during 1959. When the Broadcasting Department take over the transmitters the hours of broadcasting will be extended.

On the 1st October, 1957, the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 2,240, and the number of subscribers to the Government operated wired system in Freetown was 4,072.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population is engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups at the end of 1957 to be as follows:

| Industry                        | Number |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Building and Construction      | 9,784   |
| Mining                         | 6,908   |
| Transport (road, rail and air) | 7,271   |
| Maritime and Waterfront        | 2,999   |
| Commerce                       | 5,740   |
| Other principal industries and services (including public administration, health and agriculture) | 15,919 |

These workers served the following employers: Government 25,156; Native administrations 2,443; Service Departments (civilian employees of War Department and Admiralty) 1,214; and major private and commercial undertakings 19,808.

In addition an estimated 32,500 workers were employed by smaller employers i.e. of less than six persons. During 1957 the average monthly figure of all workers in wage-earning employment was approximately 78,000.

There were, at the end of 1957, 12 registered trade unions; eleven of these, including one employer's union with 18 members, had a total membership of 28,466. The membership figure of the twelfth union is not available.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, ground-nuts, cassava, bennised, kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: cattle 150,000, goats 21,500, sheep 10,000, pigs 5,000.

The main timber products are sawn timber, shingles, roundwood, firewood, charcoal and gum copal. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. The operation of commercial trawlers from Sierra Leone in recent years has contributed significantly to the local supply of fish.
The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite and molybdenite.

Nine pioneer oil mills for the expressing of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut oil and palm kernel oil is being operated by Government. Government also operates two small and two large rice mills and there are a number of privately-owned mills. Connected with the Government rice mills is the complementary enterprise of pig and poultry feed production.

Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise.

Village industries include fishing, fish curing and smoking, weaving, and hand methods of expressing palm oil and cracking palm kernels.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it.

On 31st December, 1957, there were 313 co-operative societies with 15,000 members, and with their capital and savings amounting to over £29,000. Their surplus and reserves were over £26,000. Their turnover during the year ending on that date was £277,700.

The most important items were cocoa and coffee marketing which amounted to over £135,000. Rice marketing developed considerably to a value of over £61,400. An important new work was the undertaking of mechanical rice cultivation by means of equipment co-operatively owned. Twenty-two tractors with ancillary equipment cultivated successfully over 3,500 acres.
