BAHAMA ISLANDS

Area, etc.

The total land area of the Colony is 4,404 square miles. It is separated on the west from Florida by the Straits of Florida and on the south from Cuba by the Old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

Population

The population in 1957 was estimated at 130,698. Except for about one-sixth, the inhabitants are or the negro race. English is universally spoken.

Principal Town

Nassau, the capital, is the chief port and the only town of any size. It is situated on the island of New Providence, the population of which is estimated to be 49,494.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of an archipelago of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited, and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are generally long, narrow and low-lying and are of aeolian limestone formation. The soil, except in small pockets, is shallow and overlays hard rock. On the whole, it is suitable only for peasant farming. Conditions are sub-tropical and both temperate and tropical trees grow literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.

Climate

The winter climate is delightful. Frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70°, the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. In July, August and September the heat ranges from 80° to 90° and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the Colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating.

The rainfall averages about 40 inches a year. The rainy months are May, June, September and October.

History

San Salvador, one of the islands composing the Colony, and identical with Watling’s Island, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had settlements on any of the islands of the group at any time. In 1649 Parliament, on the petition of William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, and others, passed “An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands” which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding an earlier Royal Grant in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles II in 1670 granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. Before the 1670 Grant the inhabitants of the islands had organized the settlement and instituted a form of government, which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected their Governor. His appointment was later confirmed by the Lords Proprietors and a regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown in 1717.

The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica. By 1703 it had reached some importance, when it was almost annihilated by the French and Spaniards. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned once more. The islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place; since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1782, but were re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux and British possession was confirmed by the Peace of Versailles, 1783. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas group and received substantial assistance from England, and in 1787 the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

Constitution and Administration

The present constitution of the Bahamas is similar to those of the North American colonies prior to the War of Independence. The government is modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected House of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

The constitution, much as it exists today, was finally settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. Representative, though not responsible, government exists. The executive government is in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who has the power of veto, and is advised by an Executive Council of not more than nine members. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation are vested by law in the Governor in Council.

The Legislative Council, consisting of nine members nominated by the Crown, was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841.

The House of Assembly is composed of 29 elected members; a qualification for members is possession of real or personal property to the value of £200. The qualification for electors is ownership of land to the value of £5 or the occupation of houses of annual rental value of £2 8s. in New Providence, or half these amounts in the Out Islands. Women have no vote. The normal life of the House is seven years, but it may be dissolved at any time by the Governor. No forms of local government exist.

In addition to the usual government departments in New Providence there are public boards dealing with public works, education, health, pilotage, agricultural and marine products, oil exploration, electrical development, telephones, prisons, industrial school, licensing (liquor and shops) and libraries, which are appointed annually by the Governor, consisting of five members, two of whom are required to be members of the House of Assembly.
In the Out Islands the Commissioners administer their respective districts; annual boards of works and health under their chairmanship are appointed by the Governor.

**Land Policy**

The Status of Aliens Act 1950 empowers an alien to acquire and hold property within the Colony.

**Taxation**

There is neither income tax nor excise duty. The general Customs duty is 20% *ad valorem* plus 7½% *ad valorem* emergency tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no emergency tax; spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general, and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American trade agreements.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 411,764    | 655,460         |
| 1953 | 2,610,679  | 2,712,272       |
| 1954 | 3,095,541  | 3,008,515       |
| 1955 | 3,507,953  | 3,188,617       |
| 1956 | 4,078,920  | 4,193,544       |
| 1957 | 4,938,958  | 4,314,864       |

The main sources of revenue are Customs dues and receipts from fees, Post Office Licences, and public utilities. In 1957 £3,219,462 of the revenue was derived from import duties. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Development Board (£556,812), Medical Department (£413,610), Public Works (£1,001,611), and Education (£324,624).

In December, 1957, the outstanding amount of the authorized Public Debt was £973,949.

**Currency**

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States and Canadian currencies are also generally accepted in the Colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government through the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are branch banks of the Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Bank of Commerce and Barclays Bank, D.C. and O., in Nassau.

A new commercial bank, the Bank of London and Montreal, with headquarters in Nassau, began operations on 1st October, 1958.

**Development**

The development of a Free Port in the island of Grand Bahama offers excellent prospects for employment in the future. The proposed development, financed by American capital, embraces the construction of a large deep-water harbour at Hawksbill Creek. The Free Port Authority has acquired 50,000 acres of land and plans have been drawn up for zoned areas in the vicinity of the proposed harbour, for industrial projects of all kinds and town planning on the most up-to-date lines. This large-scale project is not a Government scheme but was approved by the Bahamas Legislature. Licences to operate within the Free Port area are granted by the Free Port Authority.

The Bahamas Government has undertaken to supply, on reimbursement, administrative, police, customs and immigration staff which will remain under its control. The Free Port Authority will provide its own medical and educational facilities but there is provision for inspection of these services by Bahamas Government medical and education officers. In general the closest liaison has been established between the Government and the Authority.

A new hotel is under construction in New Providence and other hotels are expanding their facilities.

The Bahamas Electrical Corporation has undertaken the distillation from sea-water of 1,000,000 gallons per day of potable water to augment the water supply of New Providence. This scheme is expected to be completed by 1960, bringing the total daily capacity to 2½ million gallons per day.

**Education**

There is a government system of primary education and attendance is compulsory from 6 to 14 years of age. In 1951 legislation was passed empowering the Board of Education to conduct a Teachers' Training College, continuation classes and a circulating library for schools. The Government Primary Schools were made free in 1885. Secondary education is provided at Queen's College, Xavier's Academy, the Government High School, St. Augustine's Boys' School, Bahama Junior Academy, St. John's College and St. Andrew's College, all in Nassau, and Long Island Christian Institute in the Out Islands.

Of the 181 Primary Schools 111 are Board Schools and 29 are grant-aided; the total of pupils is 20,977. There are 988 pupils in the eight Secondary Schools. In 1957, 24 students from the Bahamas were taking courses in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on primary education in 1957 was £356,946, compared with £17,553 in 1936.

**Libraries**

There are three Public Libraries in Nassau and 27 in the Out Islands.

**Health**

The medical needs of the Colony are met by the Princess Margaret Hospital (General), Prospect Hospital (T.B., Isolation and Geriatrics) and the New Sandilands Mental Hospital, Out Island Clinics on every major island, and Cottage Hospitals at Eleuthera and Inagua. Staff consists of Chief Medical Officer, Pathologist, Psychiatrist, Schools Medical Officer, ten Medical Officers, Anaesthetist, Eye Specialist, Public Health Clinic Medical Officer, and three Dentists. The latter three categories are part-time. There are seven District Medical Officers in Out Islands. Nursing Staff consists of 1 Matron, 1 Assistant Matron, 1 Sister Tutor, 15 Nursing Sisters, 35 locally trained Staff Nurses and 75 trainees. The Out Island Service has 23 locally trained Staff Nurses. In addition there is a Public Health Nursing Service under the charge of a Public Health Nursing Sister and a staff of 8 locally trained Public Health Staff Nurses.

Hospital services are chargeable at sub-economic rates and provided free to needy persons. Clinics of all kinds are held, and a schools medical service has just been commenced.
In 1957 the in-patients numbered 7,482 with 207,624 in-patient days' treatment, and out-patients 23,429 with over 55,863 treatments. The principal diseases are tuberculosis, respiratory complaints, general abdominal complaints, hypertension and malnutrition.

Expenditure in 1957 was £413,610, compared with £25,695 in 1935.

Communications

Nassau International Airport is the main airfield in the Bahamas. It provides 24-hours service for long range international and local airlines. In addition, there are eight landing strips completed in the various Out Islands. Scheduled international air services are operated into Nassau by B.O.A.C. from London via New York and Bermuda, and from Montego Bay, Jamaica. Pan American World Airways operate daily flights from Miami and New York, Trans-Canada Airlines from Montreal via Tampa, Florida, Mackey Airlines from Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, and British West Indian Airways from Kingston.

Internal air services are run by Bahamas Airways, Limited, and Skyways Limited, with a fleet of amphibian aircraft giving complete out-island air service.

During the year 1957, air traffic at the main airport reached unprecedented levels, 11,840 landings being recorded during the year.

The following mileage is of roads in New Providence, practically all of which may be used by motor traffic:

| Type            | Public | Private |
|-----------------|--------|---------|
| Asphalted       | 141    | 7·5     |
| Macadamized     | 37     | 5·5     |
| Unimproved earth| 40     | 22      |
| Totals          | 218 miles | 35 miles |

On Eleuthera there is an asphalt main road 60 miles in length covering the greater part of the Island and on Grand Bahama, 65 miles of motor road has been built. Rough but motorable main roads stretch from end to end of the islands of Exuma, Long Island and Cat Island and around San Salvador.

There are no railways in the Colony.

There are regular freight services between the Colony and New York and Florida; Halifax and Montreal (Canadian National Steamship Line); and the United Kingdom (Royal Mail Line and Pacific Steam Navigation Company). The latter Line also operates a passenger service by the s.s. Reina del Pacifico and s.s. Reina del Mar. West India Steamships Ltd. operate a service between Nassau and Inagua with intermediate stops.

In 1957, 7,289 ships called at Nassau.

Ships also call at Inagua and Pine Ridge to take on salt and lumber exports.

The tonnage of all vessels entered and cleared in the Colony in 1957 was: British 1,379,482, total 3,845,042.

Sound and Television Broadcasting

Government owns, and the Bahamas Broadcasting and Television Commission operates, a broadcasting station located in Nassau. The power of its transmitter is 5kW., frequency 1,540 kc/s, and call sign ZNS. Commercial operation began in 1950, though a broadcasting station has existed since 1936. The Commission took over on 1st January, 1957. The broadcast receiver licence fee was abolished in 1954. At that time there were 5,990 licence holders. Government supplied and maintains 60 community receivers in school houses in the Out Islands where there may be as many as 200 listeners in the evenings.

Principal Occupations

The tourist traffic continues to be the main industry of the Colony and is the chief source of revenue and of dollars.

The following table shows the number and nationality of visitors during the years 1952-57:

| Visitors | U.S.A. | Canada | U.K. | Others |
|----------|-------|--------|------|--------|

| 1955     | 142,689| 91·9 | 4·4  | 1·7    |
| 1956     | 155,003| 91·8 | 4·8  | 1·6    |
| 1957     | 194,618| 91·4 | 4·8  | 1·5    |

Agricultural work in the United States provides employment for an average of 3,600 unskilled Bahamian labourers and their earnings in 1957 amounted to £5,503,721.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are fresh vegetables, tomatoes, okra, pineapples, peas, citrus, bananas, avocados, and sisal.

The estimated livestock population is: horses and mules 3,600, cattle 3,550, sheep 22,250, goats 14,250, swine 10,300 and poultry 407,500.

Exports of timber in 1957 totalled 6,884,000 feet, valued at £119,979.

Crawfishing and scale fishing are extensively carried out during the open season (October 1st-March 15th). The bulk of the catch is exported to the United States. The following marine products are also exported:—sponges, salt, turtle shell, beach shells, and marine curios.

There are four canning plants in the Colony which are engaged principally in canning tomatoes and pineapples. Straw products are manufactured as cottage industries and the raw material for this work is obtained chiefly from palm fronds and sisal fibre. Most of the canneries' output is consumed locally.

In 1938, 23·8% of total imports came from the U.K.; 18·5% from other Commonwealth countries and 57·7% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1957 were 22·4, 10·3 and 67·3.

In 1938, 22·6% of exports went to the U.K.; 22·5% to other Commonwealth countries and 54·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1957 were 6·1, 5·8 and 88·1.

Nearly all the Colony's requirements are imported. The chief imports are apparel, liquors, machinery, motor vehicles, electrical apparatus, petroleum oils, and foodstuffs of all kinds.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Bahamas Produce Exchange in Nassau handles much of the agricultural produce of the Colony. It assists the farmers in New Providence and Out Islands in disposing of their produce without glutting the market and depressing prices unnecessarily.

There are no co-operative societies in the Colony other than 17 Tomato Growers' Associations on the Islands of Eleuthera and Cat Island, and 65 Farmers' Associations situated throughout the Colony. These associations are assisted by the Board of Agriculture to the extent of advancing seed and fertilizer, etc., for the tomato and other crops. The Board markets the crops and deducts their advances from the proceeds of each consignor.
