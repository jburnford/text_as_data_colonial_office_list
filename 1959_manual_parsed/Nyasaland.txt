Geographical Features

Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa, and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000–3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland, and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chilwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate

The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History

The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters, and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to "The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September, 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate" but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate." The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There have been two internal disturbances; the Chilembwe Rising, in 1915, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges; and in 1953 disturbances in the Southern Province, attributed in large part to discontent over the African tenant system obtaining in privately-held estate land, resulted in the deaths of 12 Africans. In both cases rapid and successful counter-measures were taken.

Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 140). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council presided over by the Governor and comprising three ex officio members, two official members and two unofficial members, a total of seven.

As a result of changes introduced in 1956 the Legislative Council comprises 23 members, including the Governor. Four are ex officio members, seven are official members and eleven are unofficial members. Six of the unofficials are non-Africans and are elected on a non-African electoral roll by constituencies; the five African unofficials are elected by the African Provincial Councils. By an amendment to the Royal Instructions of 1907 published in August 1957, authority was given for the appointment by the Governor of a Speaker, to preside over the Legislative Council. Since the Speaker would not have an original vote in the deliberations of the Council, but only a casting vote, an eighth official member would be appointed.

Land Policy is controlled so far as African trust land, which comprises 86% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Orders in Council, 1950 and 1955. Under these orders in Council Africans may use and occupy African Trust Land not held under lease in accordance with the African law and custom prevailing in the area. The Orders in Council empower the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of
State's sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance, 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

Taxation

A Poll Tax is payable by non-African males over 18 years of age, resident in the Protectorate, at the rate of £4 per annum. An African Tax is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. The rate with effect from the 1st January, 1958, is 30s. per annum. Both the African and non-African Poll Tax can be set off against any Territorial surcharge paid by the individual concerned.

Income Tax and Customs and Excise duties are assessed and collected by the Federal Government, which took over direct responsibility for them on the 1st April, 1954.

Rates of Income Tax (1957-58) rise from 9d. in the £ on the first £500 of chargeable income to 6s. 3d. in the £ in excess of £2,500 for married persons. There are primary rebates of £37 10s. and £25 respectively for married and single persons, and rebates for children, dependants, blind persons and food farmers and in respect of insurance premiums and benefit fund contributions. Companies pay tax at 6s. 3d. in the £.

Supertax is levied (after an allowance of £3,000 for married persons and £2,000 for single persons and companies) on taxable income plus dividends received by residents of the Federation from all sources. Non-residents of the Federation are not liable to supertax on dividends received from companies incorporated in the Federation unless they carry on business there. Certain external companies as defined in the income tax law are also subject to supertax.

A tax is levied on the undistributed profits of private companies as defined in the income tax law, at the rate of 1s. 6d. in the £ on the first £2,000 of the undistributed profits and at the rate of 3s. in the £ on the remainder.

On all tax payable a surcharge is raised by the Territorial Government amounting to 20 per cent. of the Federal tax payable by both persons and companies.

Currency

The Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was established in 1956 and issues the Federal currency. Southern Rhodesia currency continues also as legal tender for the present. United Kingdom coins ceased to be legal tender as from 1st January, 1955.

Development Plans

In supersession of all previous Development Plans the Nyasaland Capital Development Plan 1957–61 was published in July, 1957. It envisages expenditure amounting to £12,817,000, over the four-year period, this amount including sums to be loaned to Local Authorities. The Plan was drawn up in consultation with the other three Governments in the Federation, and by agreement with those Governments will be recast and extended for a further period of two years after it has run for two years. The following is a summary of the proposed distribution of funds estimated to be available to various services, expressed as percentages:

| Service                                      | Percentage |
|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Natural Resources                            | 21         |

Other Development

Development in Nyasaland is concentrated on the expansion of crop production both by Government and by private interests, but many other enterprises are under way. Considerable emphasis is placed on forestry development, and good progress is being made towards the provision
of public utilities. The implementation of the Shire Valley Project, particularly in respect of the production of hydro-electric power and the reclamation and irrigation of areas in the Shire Valley is under consideration.

Prospecting on a considerable scale is being carried out for radio-active minerals, ilmenite, rutile and iron ore. There is also interest in pyrochlore, apatite, non-radio-active monazite, and vermiculite deposits. The possibility of obtaining coal from the field adjoining the Tanganyika border is under consideration. Active steps towards the development of extensive limestone deposits near Zomba are being taken by private enterprise and a large factory is to be built near to those deposits which will supply clinker to the existing mill in Blantyre, which at present relies on imported clinker.

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July, 1954.

In 1958 there were seven European Primary Schools, three of which are private schools, catering for 1,214 pupils, and one Secondary School with a total of 145 pupils. By 1959 the Secondary School will have three Forms and will expand progressively until the Vth Form is reached. There are 18 Government Primary Schools with three Post-Primary classes up to Standard 7 serving 2,314 Asian and Coloured pupils, and a Secondary School for Asian and Coloured children will, it is hoped, be completed by 1961.

In 1958, 3,163 primary schools catered for 259,179 African pupils; 866 of these schools were grant-aided and staffed by qualified teachers, the balance were conducted by the various missionary bodies without assistance from public funds.

The Government African secondary school is at Dedza. Two other full secondary schools and ten junior secondary schools, receiving assistance from public funds, provide accommodation for some 859 pupils. In 1958 eight pupils from Nyasaland attended Higher School Certificate courses at schools in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia.

There are eight assisted and one unassisted Teacher Training Centres, in addition to the Government Teacher Training Centre at Domasi. At these 893 students underwent teacher training in 1958.

An Artisan Training Centre conducted by the Department of Education, gave instruction to 123 pupils in 1958. The Government also assisted artisan training schemes at missions.

Expenditure on Education in the year 1958 was just under £700,000.

Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre for both Africans and Europeans, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools, and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

Public Health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July, 1954.

The principal endemic diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, reappeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952, but has again subsided.

There are 19 Government African Hospitals with a total of 1,383 beds, and one Mental Hospital and one Leprosarium with accommodation for 208 and 296 persons respectively.

Each African Hospital has a number of satellite rural dispensaries of which there are 96 in the Protectorate. There are also seven Health Units.

There are three Government European Hospitals with a total of 51 beds and for Asians and Coloureds there are 39 beds at various Government Hospitals.

Mission Hospitals provide 1,351 beds, inclusive of maternity.

In 1957 the total admissions and out-patient attendances for Europeans, Asians and Coloureds, and Africans were as follows:

|                  | In-patients | Out-patients |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Europeans        | 1,205       | 12,281       |
| Asians and Coloureds | 491         | 2,788       |
| Africans         | 53,607      | 1,024,106    |

Expenditure on health services during the 1957–58 financial year was £751,370.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial roads and other aspects of communications.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and 12 out-station airfields at eight of which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Federal Director of Meteorological Services, and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzimba. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation, and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways and East African Airways each operate a weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 289 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka, south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. In 1957, 763,096 tons of freight and 442,577 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 5,152, of which just over 100 miles have a bituminous carpet.
A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay—Chipoka—Kota Kota—Likoma Island—Chinteche—Nkata Bay—Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika)—Ruarwe—Florence Bay—Deep Bay—Manda (Tanganyika)—Ngara—Kaporor (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting

African broadcasting programmes are received in Nyasaland from the Central African Broadcasting Station in Lusaka. There are no wired broadcasting centres.

Nyasaland has no immediate access to the air, and broadcasting material for transmission to the African community is telegraphed or airmailed on tape to Lusaka. The Chinyanja programmes, specially directed at the African population of Nyasaland, have in the past been compiled from material recorded by visiting teams of broadcasters from Lusaka. With the introduction of the two-channel broadcasting system at Lusaka in 1957 the time allocated to Nyasaland each week was extended to seven hours. The supply of programmes for this number of hours could not be maintained on the old basis of periodical tours, and permanent staff have been posted to Zomba to open the recording studio and to ensure a regular flow of Nyasaland material for broadcasting from Lusaka. The recording studio is fully equipped with tape-recording facilities and the live material prepared includes talks, feature broadcasts, music and plays.

It is estimated that there are over 10,000 cheap "saucepan" and dry-battery sets in the Protectorate in addition to the 4,000 sets registered with the Postmaster General.

The Principal Occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, tung farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and cotton cultivation, retail trading.

There are six Trades Unions in the Protectorate with an aggregate membership of approximately 1,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil, and miscellaneous pulses.

Timber production in 1957 (excluding private land) was: softwoods 100,447 cubic feet, hardwoods 336,027 cubic feet, poles 374,522 cubic feet, firewood 3,304,898 cubic feet.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa and commercial enterprises are in process of development; fishery research is being undertaken.

No minerals were exported on a commercial scale during 1957, although samples of various minerals were sent out of the country for analysis.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of soap, cigarettes, and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

* Including Government imports but not bullion and specie.

Statistics are not now available of certain commodities and products which are exported from Nyasaland but disposed of or processed within the Federation. The figures given for 1956 and 1957 are therefore those of crops or products originating from Nyasaland which were exported to countries outside the Federation.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of the principal cash crops grown on African trust land, namely, tobacco, cotton, maize, groundnuts and beans, is handled by a statutory board whose aim is to ensure a steady remunerative price to the producer, and to secure improvement of the quality of the product. The board helps to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of an annual contribution from surpluses to the African Development and Welfare Fund. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1957 there were 79 primary and 6 secondary co-operative societies, with 7,482 and 60 members respectively.
