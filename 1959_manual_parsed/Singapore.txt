SINGAPORE

Area
The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islets, is 224·5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 31·5 square miles.

Christmas Island, the phosphate-bearing island in the Indian Ocean which was administered by the Singapore Government as part of the Colony of Singapore, was detached from Singapore on 1st January, 1958, and transferred to Australia on 1st October, 1958.

Population
The estimated population at 31st December, 1956, was 1,290,493:

Geographical Features

The island of Singapore is connected with the mainland of the Malay peninsula by a causeway three-quarters of a mile long, carrying a road, railway and water mains.

The highest point on Singapore Island is Bukit Timah, 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Headwaters from this and two other streams have been impounded to form reservoirs.

Climate of Singapore

There are no well marked dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is $87^\circ$, the mean minimum $75^\circ$; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

History

A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the Imperial Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was liberated on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South-East Asia. On the return of civil government on 1st April, 1946, it was constituted a separate Colony.

The Communist threat of the Emergency was always present in Singapore where, however, violence was sporadic, and subversion the chief tactic. After serious rioting which arose out of an industrial dispute and in which four persons were killed, the Emergency Regulations were replaced by a Preservation of Public Security Ordinance to last for three years. It increased provisions for repeal, but retained the essential powers to fight Communist subversion. In October 1958 the duration of the Ordinance was extended.

Meanwhile Communist infiltration of Chinese middle schools and trade unions continued unabated and culminated in the riots of October 1956 in which 13 persons were killed and 127 injured. The Government took firm and successful action to end the riots, and detained the leaders of subversive activities under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance. Communist activity revived in 1957, however, and in August a further 35 persons were detained under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance for their individual subversive activities within political and trade union groups; in the following month a further 48 leaders of subversive activity in Chinese schools were arrested, but 29 were soon released. The total number of detentions under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance at the end of 1957 was 131.

Constitution

Singapore now has a large measure of internal self-government under the Order-in-Council which came into force on February 8th, 1955, and which follows the general pattern of the recommendations of the Rendel Constitutional Commission Report published on February 22nd 1954. The form of Government is a Council of Ministers collectively responsible to a Legislative Assembly of predominantly elected membership.

The Constitution provides for a Council of Ministers consisting of the Governor, as President, three ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), and seven Ministers appointed from among the Elected and Nominated Members of the Legislative Assembly, provided that there shall not at any one time be more than one Minister who is a Nominated Member of the Legislative Assembly. One of the unofficial Ministers is entitled "Chief Minister". Subject only to the Governor's reserved powers, which would only be used in extreme cases where in his opinion public faith, public order or good government appeared to be impaired, the Council of Ministers controls
Government policy in all matters except external affairs, internal security and defence. Ministers are collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly for policy but have full executive authority over their respective departments, each of which has a Permanent Secretary, a Civil Servant, who exercises supervision under the general direction of the Minister. The portfolios allocated to unofficial Ministers are: Commerce and Industry; Health; Education; Labour and Welfare; Local Government, Lands and Housing; and Communications and Works. At the present time the Council of Ministers has only six unofficial members as the Chief Minister holds the portfolio of Labour and Welfare.

The Legislative Assembly consists of the Speaker, three ex officio members, four nominated unofficial members and twenty-five elected members. It met for the first time on the 25th April, 1955.

An agreement signed in London on 11th April, 1957, provides for the constitution of a State of Singapore with full internal self-government and the creation of a Singapore citizenship. There will be as the Queen's representative a Malayan Yang di-Pertuan Negara or Head of State, a Council of Ministers of ten members presided over by the Prime Minister, and a fully elected Legislative Assembly of 51 members presided over by a Speaker of their own selection. The offices of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the United Kingdom Commissioner will, after the first six months of the constitution, be separate and held by different individuals. The United Kingdom Commissioner will remain responsible for external defence and external affairs other than cultural and commercial matters.

On the 1st August, 1958, the Royal Assent was given to the State of Singapore Act, which provides for the creation of the new State. A preliminary Order in Council made in September 1958 enables elections for the new Legislative Assembly, to be set up under the new Constitution, to be held before that Constitution comes into force. The main Constitution Order in Council was made in November 1958 and will be brought into effect early in 1959, on a date to be appointed by the Governor.

On September 22nd, 1951, the Municipality received the Royal Charter conferring on Singapore the status of a City.

Land Policy

From the foundation of the Settlement of Singapore there has never been any restriction on the alienation of land to non-natives. Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas are in process of acquisition for public purposes, such as roads, school sites, and housing.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the Colony or received in the Colony from outside. Companies are chargeable at 30% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 5% on the first $1,500 of chargeable income to 40% on incomes exceeding $55,000. Non-resident individuals are charged at 30%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. Double taxation arrangements with the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark and Norway are in force.

Personal allowances are $3,000 for an unmarried person and $5,000 for a married couple, with a sliding scale of allowances for children from $750 for the first child to $200 for the sixth and subsequent children up to a maximum allowance of $8,150 for the family. In cases where children are maintained and educated outside Malaya, the allowances for children may be increased up to double the amounts. Deductions are also allowed in respect of life assurance premia and contributions to approved pension or provident funds.

| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| 1946 (9 months) | $29,498,716 | $24,352,910 |
| 1947 | $77,967,858 | $51,824,007 |
| 1953 | $238,518,829 | $169,730,549 |
| 1954 | $207,297,524 | $248,919,571 |
| 1955 | $208,833,167 | $197,911,662 |

| 1957 | $241,531,065 | $238,432,454 |

In 1957, 38·52% of revenue was derived from Customs and Excise and 39·81% from Income and other Taxes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration, General: 23·34%
- Social Services: 36·89%
- Judicial, Police and Prisons: 12·02%
- Postal Services and Telecommunications: 5·85%
- Public Works: 4·63%
- Other Services: 17·27%

The Public Debt of the Colony of Singapore at the 31st December 1957 amounted to $115 million or approximately $76·67 per head of the population. The Public Debt comprises:

- (a) S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72: $30 million
- (b) S.S. 3½% War Loan, 1952–59: $25 million
- (c) S.S. 3½% War Loan, 1953–60: $10 million
- (d) Singapore 3% Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70: $50 million

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
   (a) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya;
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.
(j) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August, 1948.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December, 1957, was $21,875,760·45.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1957, was $943,100,507·62 and coins (other than silver) $44,088,910·33.

Development Plans

Development still proceeds on the general lines of the original Plan prepared in 1950, though adjustments have been made to meet changed needs and circumstances.

During 1954 the Development Plans were examined by a Mission sent to Malaya by the International Bank. Their report generally commended the lines of development that were being followed, but proposed some modifications in the sums of expenditure. About $119 million was actually spent on development in 1957, of which capital expenditure by Government accounted for $40 million and it was estimated that about $39·5 million would be spent in 1958.

Development expenditure is financed from the Development Fund which has been augmented annually by a contribution of $20 millions from revenue. As a result of the change of financial procedure, whereby the General Reserve Balance was reduced to four months' revenue and the surplus transferred to the Development Fund, that Fund stood at $24·7 million at the beginning of 1958.

The new Singapore Airport was opened for traffic in August 1955. Work on the Terminal Building continues. The whole scheme will cost not less than $46 million, of which $10 million will have been contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

Work is progressing satisfactorily with the Singapore Telephone Board's $15 million extension scheme which is financed with a Government loan. The extension scheme will improve the telephone service of the Island and add over 7,000 lines to the service. Plans for further development are in hand.

The Singapore Industrial Promotion Board began operations in March 1957 with an initial capital of $1 million. The purpose of this Board is to assist small local firms and manufacturing concerns with long-term loans.

The establishment of a Tourist Promotion Board was the result of the recommendations of a Colombo Plan expert from New Zealand in order to develop fully the tourist industry.

Towards the end of 1957 work started on a $1 million Animal Husbandry Station at Sembawang. This Station will demonstrate to the farmers modern techniques of animal-farming, and will also disseminate information to them. Research on animal breeding and nutrition problems will also be conducted and the Station will include agricultural and fisheries experimental sections.

The City Council has proceeded vigorously with its plans to improve the supply of power and water to the island. The large modern Power Station at Pasir Panjang is not yet complete, but plans are already in hand for further extensions. The supply of water is more than keeping pace with the rapidly increasing population, but there are ambitious plans in readiness to cover all possible requirements over the next 20 years or more.

Education

The education system of the Colony provides education for some 296,305 pupils in 702 regular schools. The University of Malaya opened a division in Kuala Lumpur, Federation of Malaya, in October 1957. In Singapore it has 1,241 men and 337 women students, of whom 1,053 are from outside the Colony. The University also runs part-time courses in Singapore for 80 men and 1 woman student, of whom six are from outside the Colony. The Teachers' Training College provides courses for 1,172 men and 1,090 women students; 1,988 of these being on part-time courses while working as Teachers-in-Training in Primary Schools. There are 1,557 students in Technical Schools. In addition there are 16,707 students enrolled in Adult and Evening Classes maintained and aided by Government. Of the pupils in regular schools, 144,865 are taught in English, 135,341 in Chinese, and 16,099 in the vernacular languages (Malay and Tamil). There are 9,290 teachers employed, 50·3% of them being trained. Of the school pupils, approximately 14·7% are in secondary classes. The Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Department Estimates before their submission to Government.

The net cost of education in 1957 was $57,146,929. The comparative figures for 1947 of $3,380,000 indicate the vast increase in cost due to the implementation of the Colony's Development Programme in education.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Raffles National Library contains about 120,000 volumes, including a large and important collection of books on Malaya. There are four part-time branches. Books for children are provided at each library, and there is a separate children's library at the Main Library. The library functions as a free public library and is financed by the Colony Government. It serves as the depository for the Colony's archives and for the books and other publications which are printed in Singapore and received under the terms of the Printers and Publishers Ordinance.

Books in Chinese, Malay and Tamil, which are currently spoken in Singapore, are now available, as well as books in English and music scores. A mobile library will come into operation early in 1959; this will serve the out-lying parts of the city area, rural parts of the Island and schools.

The Raffles Museum contains collections covering the zoology, ethnography and archaeology of the Malaysian region, and of the history of Singapore and Malaya. It publishes the Bulletin of the Raffles Museum (devoted to papers on zoology), the Memoirs of the Raffles Museum (devoted to papers on local history and anthropology) and a series of popular pamphlets on museum subjects.

The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, closely associated with the Raffles Museum, publishes a quarterly journal devoted mainly to papers on history, archaeology and ethnography.
Health

The Government Medical Department provides 6,500 beds for the care of the sick of which some 2,500 are available for the treatment of acute disease. All the usual special Departments such as eye, ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics, are included in the hospital services. There are ten static dispensaries within the City, serving a population of 900,000 people.

In the rural area, with a population of 600,000, there are 12 static dispensaries, supplemented by four travelling dispensaries and two launch dispensaries. In addition the rural area has a chain of 53 maternity and child health centres. A steadily expanding school medical and dental service is working on an island-wide basis and there is also an efficient air and sea quarantine service.

More hospital beds are being added, while a new general out-patient clinic, three rural maternity and child health centres and three rural midwife centres were opened in 1957. A new District Hospital, with accommodation for the chronic sick also, is expected to be ready for occupation in 1959.

The Institute of Health which houses the City Council out-patient clinic, the Government school health services and the University's Department of Social Medicine and Public Health, in addition to providing training facilities for public health personnel, was opened in 1958.

Singapore has remained free of major epidemic diseases such as plague, cholera or smallpox; malaria has been completely eradicated, and the island is one of the healthiest city ports in the Far East.

In the field of tuberculosis, in addition to a modern hospital with over 1,000 beds, out-patient treatment is provided at a clinic, and domiciliary relief and assistance by the Almoner's Department is expanding. A Tuberculosis Treatment Allowance Scheme is operated by the Department of Social Welfare. The B.C.G. campaign started in 1951 is continuing successfully and a pilot B.C.G. vaccination experiment was carried out in 1957 for new-born babies; the results were very encouraging and the vaccination is being gradually extended throughout the island. A separate Tuberculosis Control Unit was established in 1957 and, with the assistance of Australian experts under the Colombo Plan, a free mass X-ray programme was initiated in July 1958. It is expected initially to examine 50,000 persons from four selected areas, with a view to determine the extent of the disease and to provide a basis for its control and eventual eradication. The Royal Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association with its own clinic and treatment centre gives most valuable co-operation to the Government.

Main hospital out-patient attendances, which were under 100,000 per annum before the war, have risen to nearly 2,000,000; yearly attendances at rural and maternity clinics have risen from 85,000 to over 300,000. Home visits by health nurses now total 50,800 a year and by midwives 58,000; 7,961 confinements were attended to in rural areas while the maternity hospital dealt with some 28,000 cases, or over 44% of the total births of the Colony. In-patients in the main acute hospitals totalled over 85,000, compared with 26,000 before the war. Leprosy services are being rapidly modernized, and some 3,500 patients are under treatment or observation.

Health figures for the Colony continue to improve. Although the population is increasing by some 50,000 a year through natural means, the death rate decreased from 19·51 in 1939 to 7·3 in 1957. The infantile death rate fell from 130·4 per 1,000 in 1939 to 41·11 in 1957. The birth rate at 42·9 continues to be one of the highest in the world.

There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualifications of M.B. and B.S., registrable in the United Kingdom, can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery), also registrable in the United Kingdom, the Diploma of Pharmacy and the Certificate of the Royal Society of Health. A complete course for nurses is in operation and the local qualification is registrable in England and Wales. The Diploma in Public Health granted by the University is recognised by the General Medical Council. Under the Colombo Plan, the Royal Australian College of Surgeons conducted a primary examination for the fellowship in Singapore in 1957 after the candidates were given a preliminary training by Australian experts.

Statutory Boards cover all medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy activities, and there is a Hospitals Board. There is also a Medical Advisory Council to give expert advice on medical and health problems and projects.

The Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1957 amounted to $34,700,000 compared with only $6,300,000 in 1947.

Communications

Air—Singapore Airport, seven and a half miles from the city centre, is an international airport, and one of the finest in South-East Asia. It has a runway of 8,000 feet (L.C.N. 60) which can be extended to 10,000 ft. if required; a wide taxi-way and efficient lighting. The Joint Air Traffic Control Centre based at Singapore Airport controls all flights within the confines of its 750,000 square miles Flight Information Region.

In 1957 a total of 23,455 aircraft and 254,044 passengers used the airport.

Major external international passenger, airmail and cargo air carriers operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways.
- British Overseas Airways Corporation.
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines.
- Pan American World Airways.
- Cathay Pacific Airways.
- Thai Airways.
- Garuda Indonesian Airways.
- Air Ceylon.
- Air Laos.
- Air-India International.
- Union of Burma Airways.
- Japan Air Lines.
- Skyways Limited.
- Airwork Limited.

Malayan Airways Limited operate daily domestic flights to all important points in the Federation of Malaya and regular scheduled services to Indonesia, Thailand, Borneo, Sarawak, and Hong Kong.
Road—The Public Works Department maintains 278·21 miles of bituminous roads in the City and Rural areas. The City Engineer maintains 199·54 miles of roads in the City area.

Rail—The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge and the total route mileage is 1,028 miles. The Railway enters the Colony at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

Water—The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers and other Colony waters.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu, under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin, on behalf of the Singapore Government. The Chairman and members of the Board are appointed by the Governor.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Length | Water depth |
|--------|-------------|
| West Wharf | 4,325 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| Empire Dock (24½ acres) | 3,522 ft. 27 ft. and over |
| Main Wharf | 3,152 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| East Wharf | 700 ft. 24 ft. |
| North Wall, Empire Dock | 940 ft. 12 ft. |

During the year ended 30th June, 1958, cargo handled by the wharves totalled 5,452,794 tons. The number of vessels accommodated alongside the wharves during this period was 3,575, net registered tonnage being 11,776,408.

The Board maintains a fleet of tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships, including a salvage tug with a range of 3,000 miles; also a Fire Brigade.

The Board has first-class facilities for dry docking and repairing ships of all sizes. There are six dry docks, the largest of these being the King's Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons gross. Repair berths total 3,000 feet in length.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, North and South America, South and East Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the various countries in Asia. Several coasting lines are engaged in conveying transit cargo to and from Thailand, Indonesia, Borneo, Sarawak, Malayan ports and Cambodia.

Broadcasting

Radio Malaya is operated on a pan-Malayan basis by the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Programmes in English, Chinese (seven dialects), Malay and Tamil are broadcast over three networks. The total number of hours of broadcasting is 247 per week, of which over 23 hours are occupied by broadcasts to Schools in English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil.

In Singapore the Department has studios and offices at Caldecott Hill. The main transmitting Station is at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the City, where four short wave transmitters of average power 74 kW, and three medium wave transmitters of average power 10 kW, are situated.

The number of broadcast listening station licences in Singapore at the end of 1957 was 63,618.

A commercial company operates a wired broadcasting service in Singapore under Government licence, to which there were 37,872 subscribers in Singapore at 31st December, 1957.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief industries are: transport and communications (including port and lightercage) 74,000, commerce and finance 102,000, light industries 93,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 28,000, public administration (central Government, Defence Services and Local Authorities) 58,000. In August 1958 there were 217 registered trade unions of employees, having a membership of 139,074.

Main Products

The small area of agricultural land is used mainly to produce food crops for local consumption. Poultry-rearing as a rural industry is thriving and 24,000,000 head are kept. This is more than sufficient for local consumption and allows some to be exported. The number of pigs slaughtered at abattoir in 1957 was 420,900.

Manufactures comprise a wide range of light industries. The traditional concentration on processing of primary products such as rubber, tin, sago, rattan, and the provision of shipbuilding, docking and ship repairing facilities, light engineering works and motor assembly plants has been supplemented in recent years by a growing range of consumer goods such as dry cell batteries, glass products, edible oils, soap, perfumes, paper products, poultry food, paint, metal boxes, shoe polish, rope, biscuits, confectionery, and pencils.

The huge long-term building programmes are also materially assisting construction industries such as brick and tile making, cement block manufacturing, sawmilling, metal window-frame works and makers of furniture and fixtures. A steel-rolling mill produces mild steel bars similar to British products.

The Government encourages industrial expansion and welcomes overseas investment. An Industrial Promotion Board with an initial capital of $1,000,000 was set up in 1957.

There is extensive fishing in local waters, but the catch is insufficient to meet the demand and is supplemented by imports. In consequence, Government is giving every encouragement to the development of offshore fisheries.

Trade

Singapore handles the major proportion of the imports and exports of the Federation of Malaya. In addition much of the external trade of her immediate neighbours passes through her hands. The chief exports are rubber, tin, timber,
petroleum products, copra, canned pineapples, coconut oil and spices. A wide range of manufactured consumer and capital goods is also imported for local consumption and for re-export.

| Trade          | Total Imports ($ million) | Total Exports ($ million) |

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. A Pan-Malayan Statutory Board, the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board, has been appointed to replace the Pineapple Joint Industrial Council. The Board is vested with overall authority in the conduct of the affairs of the industry including the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruits, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

Singapore has 100 Co-operative Societies, made up of 38 Thrift and Loan Societies, 18 Thrift and Investment Societies, 12 Stores and Shops Societies, 11 Marketing Societies, 2 Housing Societies, 4 Rural Credit Societies, 5 Labourers and Co-operative Credit Societies, 4 Banking and Union Societies and 6 Miscellaneous Societies. Total membership is 32,980, working capital $11,472,800 and Reserve Fund $300,950.
