RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland (area 148,575 square miles).

2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the Nyasaland Protectorate. The area is estimated at about 291,000 square miles.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1889, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tati and Ramaquaban rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamatenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district as defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory was previously divided into two provinces:

(a.) Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.

(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.

By the order in Council, dated 4th May, 1911, these two provinces were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. The amalgamation took effect from 17th August, 1911. The limits of the territory as defined by the order in Council are "the parts of Africa bounded by Southern Rhodesia, German South-West Africa, Portuguese West Africa, the Congo Free State, German East Africa, Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa."

History.

On the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed; the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lobengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Madoutaie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was duly reached, and Fort Salisbury, 12 miles South-east of Mount Hampden, having been founded (12th September, 1890) the pioneers were disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims and farms.

In July, 1893, the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria,
when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's police and a small force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson and a small party of men were, after a heroic resistance, killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from small-pox or fever.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. After a prolonged struggle the rebellion was subdued in September, 1897.

The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures.

In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established, and the precautions taken completely stamped out the disease.

From 1897 to 1899 the development of the country advanced rapidly, but the outbreak of the war with the Republics, in October, 1899, practically put a stop to progressive work of every kind, and for months the territory was completely cut off from the south.

On the outbreak of hostilities Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir Robert) Baden-Powell was in supreme command of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. When Mafeking was invested the command of the Rhodesian forces devolved upon Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir H. C.) Plumer, who was stationed at Tuli with a force of 450 men. In November, 1899, Martial Law was proclaimed in certain districts in Matabeleland, and, at a later date, in the whole territory, and the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers to the number of 800, were called out for active service.

At the beginning of January, 1900, Colonel Plumer moved his column to Palachwe and assumed direct command of the troops in the Protectorate, amongst whom were included 600 Volunteers and over 400 men of the British South Africa Police. Mafeking was successfully relieved by Mahon and Plumer's united columns on the 17th May.

In the early part of 1900 a force of 5,000 men, consisting of Australian, New Zealand and Canadian Volunteers and English Yeomanry, was despatched to Rhodesia, via Beira, under the command of General Sir Frederick Carrington. This force was sent to the front as speedily as possible, two companies of Militia Infantry being retained at Bulawayo as a garrison.

The Administration of Southern Rhodesia estimated that the number of men contributed by Rhodesia was approximately 1,500, being at least 12½ per cent. of the European population. Despatches which have been published bear testimony to the good work performed by the Volunteers, Police, and the Rhodesia Regiment, and they also gained the special approbation of the late Commander-in-Chief.

The attitude of the natives throughout the war was most satisfactory, and, although in some districts there appeared signs of unrest, it was confined to attempts by discontented natives to work up the feelings of the people, who were, however, not affected by them to any appreciable degree.

Martial Law in Southern Rhodesia was withdrawn on the 26th July, 1902.

**Constitution.**

In 1888 that portion of Rhodesia now known as Southern Rhodesia was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1889, a resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original Charter of the Company by a Supplemental Charter, and a further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 10th of January, 1900.

The Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, originally laid down by the Charter, was subsequently amended by the Orders in Council of the 9th May, 1891; 30th July, 1891; and 18th July, 1894, the latter being known as the "Matabeleland Order in Council." This Order was revoked by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1898, which provides for the Administration of the Territory, Legislation, the Preservation of Peace and Order, the Constitution of Courts of Justice, and Native Administration. This Order has been amended by the Southern Rhodesia Orders in Council of the 16th February, 1903, 10th August, 1909, 4th May, 1911, 11th February, 1913, 10th August, 1914, 16th February, 1915, 2nd March, 1915, 27th June, 1916, and 28th July, 1916. Under the Order of 1898, as amended, there is a Resident Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State. To assist the Administrator there is an Executive Council, composed of not less than three members appointed by the Company, with the approval of the Secretary of State. A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), six nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and twelve members elected by the Registered Voters.

A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), six nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and twelve members elected by the Registered Voters. The Resident...
Commissioner sits on both the Executive and Legislative Councils, but without a vote. Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council, when assented to by the High Commissioner, take effect immediately, but within a year may be disallowed by the Secretary of State. The duration of each Legislative Council is three years. The first Legislative Council was elected in 1899. The number of Registered Voters in 1913 was 9,543.

By a Proclamation, dated 10th June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony in force on that date were adopted for and are administered in Southern Rhodesia as far as the circumstances of the country will permit, unless amended or repealed by the Legislative Council. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequent to the 10th June, 1891, do not apply to Rhodesia.

For the administration of justice there is a High Court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, the judges being appointed by the Secretary of State, on the nomination of the Company. In the districts there are Magistrates' Courts. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, and thence to the Privy Council.

The administrative system of Northern Rhodesia is prescribed by the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council of 4th May, 1911, amended by Northern Rhodesia Orders in Council of 1914 (1), 1915, and 1916.

On the 9th October, 1914, His Majesty's Government published the following notice in the press:

"His Majesty's Government have had under their careful consideration the question of the future administration of the territories at present administered by the British South Africa Company. Clause 33 of the Company's Charter, which bears date the 29th day of October, 1889, reserves to the Crown the power at the end of twenty-five years from the date of the Charter, and at the end of every succeeding period of ten years, to add to or repeal any of the provisions of the Charter or to enact other provisions in substitution for or in addition to any of its existing provisions. It is further provided that this power shall only be exercised in relation to so much of the Charter as relates to administrative and public matters, and failing the exercise of this power the Charter is automatically extended for another ten years.

His Majesty's Government are advised that there is no power, either in the Charter or elsewhere, to shorten or vary the periods at the end of which addition to, or alteration or repeal of, the administrative provisions of the Charter is possible.

The Directors of the British South Africa Company have, however, informed Mr. Harcourt that they would not regard the non-exercise by His Majesty of his right of reviewing on the 29th instant such of the provisions of the Charter as relate to administrative and public matters as any bar to the establishment of Responsible Government, should the time appear to be ripe for such a step during the ten years which would elapse before, under the terms of the Charter, His Majesty's right of review would again become exercisable; and that if, during those ten years, the inhabitants of Southern Rhodesia should find that they were, financially and in other respects, strong enough to assume, with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government, the burden of administration, and should express through the Legislative Council their desire to assume that burden, they, the Directors, would be most willing that effect should be given to that desire.

In view of this statement and of the desire expressed by the Legislative Council for the continuance of the Company's administration, His Majesty's Government have decided not to advise His Majesty to exercise the powers reserved by Article 33 of the Charter, and its administrative and public provisions will accordingly not be modified. His Majesty will, however, be advised, in due course, to issue a Supplemental Charter, giving effect to the arrangement, to which the Directors of the British South Africa Company have agreed, to render possible the establishment of Responsible Government in Southern Rhodesia, should the Legislative Council desire it, and should His Majesty's Government concur, at some date other than that which the Charter permits."

A Supplemental Charter, giving effect to this arrangement, was issued on 13th March, 1915.

Local Government.

Salisbury and Bulawayo were constituted municipalities in October, 1897, and Gwelo and Umtali in August, 1914. Sanitary Boards are appointed for the other principal towns.

Native Administration.

The Native Department of Southern Rhodesia is administered by the Secretary for Native Affairs, the duties of the office at the present time being undertaken by the Administrator. He is assisted by a Chief Native Commissioner, whose duties are defined by High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 32 of 1913. The Territory is divided into 32 native districts, each in charge of a Native Commissioner, who is appointed by the Administrator, with the approval of the High Commissioner, as laid down in the "Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," and whose duties are defined by the High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 55 of 1910 (promulgated 14th October, 1910).

Formerly the natives were scattered throughout the country, but now land has been reserved for tribal settlements which is suitable for their agricultural and pastoral requirements. A special Commission was appointed by the Imperial Authorities in 1914 for the purpose of finally defining these Native reservations.

The only tax imposed upon them is an annual poll-tax of 1l. Excellent provision has been made for those who go to work at the mines. Compounds have been erected and hospitals provided at most of the mines, which are periodically visited by Government Inspectors; their contracts are supervised by officials who see that the terms are faithfully fulfilled by the employers, and in the event of injustice they have their remedy in a court of law under the "Master's and Servant's Ordinance." A native at the mines can easily earn from 30s. to 3l. a month with food and lodging.

Climate.

The Rhodesian plateau lies at an altitude of from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. Broadly speaking, the year has two divisions, the wet and the dry season. The early rains of the wet season (which is the summer) gradually appear towards the end of October, increase in frequency and force until January, and disappear about the end of
April. From May to September there is practically no rain. Taking into consideration the vast extent of the territory the climate naturally varies. In the highlands it is very healthy and bracing. Formerly, in the low-lying districts, malarial fever was very prevalent, but with the opening up of the country, better housing and food, it is rapidly disappearing. The summer is not oppressively hot, nor is the winter very cold. The average shown by the maximum and minimum thermometers in the shade at the principal towns, during the year ending 30th June, 1915, was:

| Town       | Max. | Min. |
|------------|------|------|
| Salisbury  | 80°1 | 53°0 |
| Bulawayo   | 77°1 | 55°0 |

Rainfall.

| Town       | Inches |
|------------|--------|
| Salisbury  | 33°42  |
| Umtali     | 38°33  |
| Bulawayo   | 35°14  |

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Victoria, Hartley, Mazoe, Gwanda, Enkeldoorn, Gatooma, Abercorn, Sinioa and Gwelo, each supplied with a complete staff of doctors and nurses. Cottage hospitals have also been erected in various districts to meet the wants of the mining centres.

Population.

A census for Southern Rhodesia was taken on the 7th May, 1911, showing the number of Europeans to be 23,606 (Mashonaland, 12,631; Matabeleland, 10,975). Since that date it is estimated that the number of Europeans has increased by between 9,000 and 10,000, bringing the white population up to 32,882 approximately. The native population of Southern Rhodesia at 31st December, 1914, was estimated to be 750,000. There were also approximately 3,000 Asiatics and other coloured persons. The European population of Northern Rhodesia on the same date was 1,497, and the native population is estimated at 857,000. It is estimated that the European population has increased, approximately, to 2,000, since the date of the census.

Chief Towns.

The chief towns of Southern Rhodesia are Salisbury (the capital), Hartley, Gatooma, Umtali and Victoria in Mashonaland; and Bulawayo, Gwelo and Selukwe, in Matabeleland. Townships have also been formed at Rusapi, Gwanda, Enkeldoorn, Melsetter, Umvuma and at other places.

Salisbury, the seat of the Government, has a white population of about 4,000. The town stands 4,890 feet above sea level. Branches of the Standard Bank, National Bank of South Africa, and African Banking Corporation have been established.

Bulawayo is the commercial centre of Matabeleland, with a white population of 5,300 and stands 4,469 feet above the sea level. Branches of the same banks as at Salisbury have been opened. There is a public hospital which is one of the finest in South Africa. The town is on the main line of railway from Cape Town to the far north, and is distant from Cape Town 1,362 miles.

Railways.

The Bechuanaland Railways (now Rhodesia Railways, Limited) reached Bulawayo on the 19th October, 1897, and the line to that town was formally opened on the 4th November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was opened on the 22nd May. On the 1st August, 1900, the widening of the gauge of the Beira Railway to 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa, was completed. On the 6th October, 1902, the line was completed between Salisbury and Bulawayo, a distance of 301 miles, thus establishing through communication between Cape Town and Beira (over 2,000 miles). The line passes through the mining districts of Hartley, Queque, Gwelo, Bombesi, etc. The railway from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls (232 miles) on the River Zambesi was completed in June, 1904, and the further extension northward, via Kalomo, to the Broken Hill Mine, 374 miles from the Falls, was opened for traffic on 1st September, 1906. Another section of the line from Broken Hill to the Congo Border (132 miles) was completed in December, 1906, by the Rhodesia-Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company, Limited. There is, therefore, through communication between Cape Town and the northern border of Northern Rhodesia, a total distance of 2,149 miles. A further extension to Kambove, in the Congo State (272 miles), has been constructed by the Compagnie du Chemin de fer du Katanga. This line is being extended northwards towards Bukama, and has reached Tshilongo, 324 miles from the Congo Border. The Zambesi river is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide, and about 420 feet above the level of the water. The structure was formally opened by the late Sir G. H. Darwin, K.C.B., President of the British Association, on the 12th September, 1906. A line from Bulawayo to the West Nicholson mine in the Gwanda district (120 miles), to open up the gold and coal areas to the south-east, has been constructed, and a line, with a 2-feet gauge, from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine in the Lomagundi district (84 miles), was opened for traffic on the 1st November, 1902. A branch (12 miles) has been made from this line to the Eldorado Mine. These two branches have since been widened to standard gauge (3 ft. 6 in.), when the last 17 miles of the narrow gauge line from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine was taken up. The line has since been extended beyond the Eldorado Mine across the Hunyani River into the Sinioa district (4 miles). A line from Gwelo to Selukwe (24 miles) was completed in August, 1903, and one from Lyndhurst Halt (near Gwelo) to Umvuma (50 miles), was opened in June, 1909. An extension of this line to Victoria, a further 70 miles, was opened on the 10th July, 1914. At the same time the line to Umvuma was diverted from Lyndhurst Halt and taken direct into Gwelo. A railway from Salisbury to the Jumbo Mine in the Mazoe district (about 22 miles) was recently opened for traffic and an extension of this line to Shamva in the Salisbury district, a distance of about 50 miles from the Jumbo Mine, was opened on 23rd April, 1913. A line to the Matopos, where Mr. Rhodes is buried, was opened for traffic on November 1st, 1903.

The total mileage of the Rhodesian Railway Systems (including the Beira Railways) at the end of 1915 was 2,468 miles.

Lands and Agriculture.

In 1897 a geodetic survey of Southern Rhodesia was initiated under the superintendence of the late Sir David Gill, K.C.B., H.M. Astronomer at the
Cape of Good Hope, and was completed to the Zambesi river, in August, 1901.

Unimproved land in Southern Rhodesia may be purchased from the British South Africa Company outright for cash, subject to the fulfilment of a simple occupation condition, or it may be held under a permit of occupation with option of purchase for cash, or by instalments, at any time within ten years. The title deed gives the purchaser the freehold to the land subject to an annual payment of quit-rent, which is roughly £1 per 1,000 acres. An extensive scheme for the promotion of closer settlement by Europeans is now under consideration by the British South Africa Company. Applications for land should be addressed to the Director of Land Settlement, Salisbury, Rhodesia. Information and handbooks can be supplied by the Rhodesian Emigration and Information Office, 2 London Wall Buildings.

Special steamship and railway facilities are given to bond fide farmer settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for the benefit of the farming community.

Considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. It may be said that virtually the whole of Southern Rhodesia is well watered, and adapted for stock-raising and for agriculture. Cattle generally do very well in all parts. Sheep and goats thrive in many parts and will do better after the grass is fed down. Pigs thrive well, and, so far, have never shown disease. Poultry and eggs always command a ready sale at remunerative prices. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical regions can be successfully cultivated. Maize, Kaffir-corn, and other native cereals grow well in the rainy season without irrigation. Tobacco culture has now passed the experimental stage, and the industry is being rapidly developed. The plant grows luxuriantly, and a considerable acreage is under cultivation. Maize and tobacco are already being exported, and later it is hoped to export other products such as fibres, rubber and cotton. Large fruit orchards have been planted, and nearly all fruit trees thrive, the cultivation of oranges and lemons constituting a rapidly expanding industry. The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails from the United Kingdom to Southern Rhodesia are conveyed by the mail steamers of the subsidised Union-Castle Company, weekly, between Southampton and Table Bay. From Cape Town they are conveyed by train to Bulawayo in 24 days. Mail and passenger trains leave Cape Town for Bulawayo on Tuesdays and Saturdays, performing the journey in three days. From Bulawayo to Salisbury the mails are conveyed four times a week, the journey occupying about 20 hours. There are two mail and passenger trains weekly between Salisbury and Beira, the time occupied on the journey being about 23 hours.

A few of the outlying districts of Southern Rhodesia are still served by mail coaches and carts.

Northern Rhodesia receives its mails via Bulawayo. They are conveyed from Bulawayo to Victoria Falls and Broken Hill by train, and to the several postal stations in the territory by native runners.

Mail matter may, however, still be forwarded to Fort Jameson and other stations in the Eastern portion of the territory by the Chinde and Blantyre route. The time occupied in the transmission of the mails between Fort Jameson and the United Kingdom is now five weeks and two days.

On the 31st of December, 1915, 105 post offices were open in Southern Rhodesia, at 42 of which Money Order and Savings Bank business was transacted. Telegraph Money Orders are also exchanged between Money Order Offices in Rhodesia and with the United Kingdom, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony.

The rate for inland letters is 1d. per ½ oz., and the same rate to other parts of South Africa. The rate for letters for places over-sea was reduced from 2½d. to 1d. per ½ oz. from 1st April, 1911. The rate for letters from the United Kingdom to Rhodesia is 1d. per oz.

The Rhodesian Telegraph and Telephone system extends from Ramathlabama, on the northern border of Cape Colony, to Ujiji in East Africa, and comprises 8,359 miles of wire, on 3,393 miles of poles.

On the 31st December, 1914, 108 telegraph offices were open. The rate for Inland telegrams is 1d. per word; for telegrams exchanged between Rhodesia and other parts of South Africa, 2½d. per word; and for cablegrams to Europe is 2s. 8½d. per word. Telegrams from Europe and from South Africa, for the Portuguese province of Manica and Sofala, Portuguese East Africa (including Chinde and Quilimanje), the Nyasaland Protectorate, and North Eastern Rhodesia, all pass over the Rhodesian lines.

Telephone exchanges are in operation at 106 towns and mining centres.

Post Office Savings Banks were established on 1st January, 1905. Up to 31st December, 1915, the amount deposited was 926,239L., and the amount withdrawn was 804,168L. 145,210L. has been invested in Trustee Securities.

Customs.

Prior to the 1st August, 1899, no duties were leviable upon goods entering Southern Rhodesia. On that date the Customs Ordinance came into operation, and continued in force till August, 1903, when, as a result of the South African Customs Conference, the necessary Ordinance empowering Southern Rhodesia to enter the newly formed Customs Union was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council. This Convention of 1903 was superseded by that of 1906. The Tariff was amended in 1908. On the 30th June, 1910, the Customs Union was terminated by mutual consent, but an agreement has been entered into between Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa, by which the tariff was unaltered.

In August, 1914, "The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," was amended by "The Southern Rhodesia (Customs) Amendment Order in Council, 1914."

The chief effect of the Amendment is that Rhodesia is empowered to impose higher import duties than those limited by previous legislation on tobacco and intoxicating liquor, and the imposition of excise and surtax on certain articles manufactured in South Africa and Rhodesia.

Under two Ordinances, Nos. 8 and 9 of 1914, promulgated on 14th August, the duty and excise
on intoxicating liquor was raised from 6s. to 12s. a gallon and an excise and surtax were imposed of cigarettes.

"The Customs, Tariff and Management Amending Ordinance, 1914," amending the Ordinances of 1906, 1908 and 1910, and a further Ordinance imposing an import and excise duty on beer and matches were promulgated on 13th November, and under these new Customs regulations and tariffs were published setting out Customs duties now leviable.

A new Customs Agreement was entered into between the Union of South Africa and the Administrations of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, rendered necessary by the amendment of its Customs tariff by the Union Parliament.

The following is the value of the declared imports into Southern Rhodesia during the past ten years, together with the amount of duty collected:

| Year ended 31st Dec., | Value. | Duty. |

Minerals.

GOLD.—That gold was obtained from Rhodesia in prehistoric times is evidenced from the innumerable "ancient workings," the ruins of temples and forts supposed to date from the time of the Himyarites and Phoenicians, and the discovery of gold beads, gold plates, fine chains, wire, nails, etc. From the occupation of the country in 1890 by the British South Africa Company when the European population amounted to about 500 persons, consisting of the pioneers and a few officials, up to September, 1893, the gold produced only amounted to 6,470 ounces. Since that date, however, the output has been steadily increasing, and the following table shows the progress made during the last ten years:

| Year | Bullion. | Estimated Value. |
|------|----------|------------------|
| 1906 | ...      | £1,985,099       |
| 1907 | ...      | £2,178,886       |
| 1908 | ...      | £2,526,007       |
| 1909 | ...      | £2,823,709       |
| 1910 | ...      | £2,568,198       |
| 1911 | ...      | £2,647,896       |
| 1912 | ...      | £2,707,369       |
| 1913 | ...      | £2,903,267       |
| 1914 | ...      | £3,580,209       |
| 1915 | ...      | £3,823,168       |
| 1916 | ...      | £3,895,311       |

Fine Gold.

| Year | Value. |
|------|-------|
| 1908 | £606,961 ozs. |
| 1909 | £623,389     |
| 1910 | £609,956     |
| 1911 | £628,521     |
| 1912 | £642,808     |
| 1913 | £639,954     |
| 1914 | £854,480     |
| 1915 | £915,029     |
| 1916 | £930,356     |

From the 1st April, 1908, all results have been declared in ounces of fine gold instead of in bullion.

COAL.—For some years past coal has been known to exist in several districts. In the Wankie District, 212 miles from Bulawayo, and 70 miles from the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, a coal bed of large extent is being worked. The result of careful and systematic examination shows that as regards quality the coal is only from 4 to 6 per cent. inferior to Welsh steam coal of similar quality. During the 12 months ended 31st December, 1916, the output amounted to 491,582 tons, as against 409,763 tons in 1915. Other promising discoveries of coal have been made in the Victoria, Tuli and Sebungwe districts, also in North-Western Rhodesia, but, so far, sufficient exploratory work has not been carried out to admit of a final opinion being pronounced as to their precise value.

The output of silver during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1916, was 200,676 oz., and for 1915, 185,233 oz.

COPPER.—Discoveries of copper have been reported in the Victoria, Lomagundi and Gwelo districts in Southern Rhodesia, and highly promising deposits have been disclosed in Northern Rhodesia. During the year 1916, 3,522 tons of copper have been produced in Southern Rhodesia, principally from the Falcon mine. Tin has also been discovered in the Victoria and Salisbury districts in Southern Rhodesia.

During 1905 diamonds were discovered in the Gwelo district, and 11,854 carats have been declared up to the 31st December, 1916.

Discoveries of asbestos have been made in the Victoria district of Mashonaland, and in the Belingwe district of Matabeleland, and during the 12 months ended 31st December, 1916, the output amounted to 6,156 tons, as against 2,010 tons in 1915.

Amongst other minerals, 131 tons of Tungsten ores, and 477,310 tons of chrome iron ore, have been exported up to 31st December, 1916.

Education.

On the 31st December, 1915, there were in Southern Rhodesia 63 Government and 4 aided schools. During the year 7 new schools were opened. The total number of children in Government-aided schools was 3,231 as against 3,101 for the previous year, an increase of nearly 5 per cent. The total expenditure from Government funds amounted to £6,387l., and £20,891l. was received in respect of tuition fees. The number of native schools which received Government grants during 1915 was 338 as compared with 287 for 1914.

In 1910 two High Schools (one for boys and one for girls) were opened both in Salisbury and Bulawayo, which provide an education fully equal to the best secondary schools in England. The number of pupils enrolled has far exceeded expectations.

Owing to the munificent bequests of the late Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit, largely increased educational facilities are now afforded. Scholarships and Bursaries are granted to pupils in the country, and, in addition, there are nine "Rhodes Scholarships" (three per annum) by which a Rhodesian can secure a three years' course at Oxford University.
Sir William H. Milton, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., after a term of office extending over sixteen years, resigned the position of Administrator of Southern Rhodesia in October, 1914, and was succeeded by Mr. Drummond Chaplin.
