NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The State of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 154th meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the State of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the State follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the State is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the State follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dunaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dunaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,367 square miles (inclusive of Federal Capital area at Yass-Canberra—900 square miles), or 198,635,000 acres, being a little over two and a half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 195,669,000 acres, or about 305,733 square miles.

The length of the State, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 683 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 756 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 23" 10" E. long.

Of the total area of the State, 58,779,449 acres have been alienated, or were in process of alienation on the 30th June, 1915.

The number of Alienated Holdings over one acre in extent for the year ended 30th June, 1915, were:

| Acres | Number |
|-------|--------|
| 1 to 30 | 33,219 |
| 31 to 400 | 38,188 |
| 401 to 1,000 | 12,787 |
| 1,001 to 10,000 | 8,747 |
| 10,001 and upwards | 701 |

Total | 93,642 |

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, at Port Jackson, under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1800 was 4,958. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 36,598. The dis-
covery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland. On the 1st January, 1901, the Colony of New South Wales united with the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, in a Federal Commonwealth of Australia.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade in 1914 was 47°2', to Bourke, 70°2'; Brewarrina, 70°9'; Moree, 68°1'; and Walgett, 69°8'. On the coast it varied from 61°4' at Bega to 69°2' at Grafton, Sydney being 65°0', almost the same as Barcelona. On the mountains snow lies in a few places all winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 57°8', and on the inland plains about 65°2'.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1914 at Sydney was 56°42 inches; and the days on which rain fell 149. This was a very good year, as the average rainfall over 66 years is about 48 inches annually. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day. Seventy-five years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The direct staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The direct export of wool, the produce of the State, to countries outside Australia during the past seven years has been as follows:

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry; 43 vessels, of a total tonnage of 7,351, were registered during the year ended 30th June, 1915, while the total number of vessels on the registers at 30th June, 1915, was 1,160, with a tonnage of 144,706.

Manufactories and Works.

In 1914-15 there were 5,271 manufactories and works, employing 116,462 persons, of whom 90,301 were males and 26,161 females. The total value of plant and machinery was £16,833,973l.; the total wages paid amounted to £12,654,446l.; and the value of the output was £8,220,573l.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was received during 1915 to the extent of £1,870,358l.

The 18 banks operating in the State in 1915 were:—Bank of New South Wales; Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, Ltd.; Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Ltd.; Aus-
AUSTRALIA—NEW SOUTH WALES.

The average note circulation for the same period was £7,316£., the decrease of late years being due to the issue of the Commonwealth notes.

The Savings Bank of New South Wales, established in 1832, and the Government Savings Bank, established in 1871, which were formerly conducted separately, were amalgamated on the 1st May, 1914. The number of depositors on the 30th June, 1915, was 755,835, and the value of deposits, £5,562,049£.. These figures include transactions of the Savings Department of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Interest is allowed at the rate of 3½ per cent. per annum on all deposits up to £200£.; 3 per cent. from £200£. to £500£.; Friendly Societies, etc., 3½ per cent. up to £500£., and 3 per cent. on excess without limitation.

Means of Communication.

On the 30th June, 1916, there were 4,188 miles of railways, owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been £68,825,592£.. The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1916, were £8,006,078£., and the working expenses £5,661,168£., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being £2,344,910£.. There were also 1411 miles of private railway, exclusive of other branch lines connected with coal and other mines. There were also 2292 miles of Government tramways, earning £1,991,628£., against working expenses amounting to £1,602,650£.. The total capital expenditure on tramways was £8,166,423£..

Telegraphs.

Of telegraphs there are 20,828 miles open (including telephones), with 231,689 miles of wire and 1,937 stations. The cost of construction, including telephones, was £2,965,117£. to 30th June, 1914, and the revenue received during year ended 30th June, 1914, £288,398£., from telegraph, and £89,018£., from telephone.

The following are the numbers of telegrams transmitted and received in New South Wales during 1914:

| Transmitted |
|-------------|
| Outside New South Wales | 1,202,077 |
| Inland | 3,753,301 |
| Total | 4,955,378 |

| Received |

| Outside New South Wales | 1,223,548 |
| Inland | 3,753,301 |
| Total | 4,976,849 |

Of inland rivers the Murray, Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan are navigable most of the year, and nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, the Macleay, the Manning, the Hunter, the Hawkesbury, and the Shoalhaven, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Brindisi), the Orient Royal Mail lines (via Suez and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), White Star line (via Durban and Capetown), Aberdeen line (via Natal and Capetown), Federal, Houlder, Shire and Bucknall lines (via Suez). Seven mails per month are sent to and despatched from England.

Letters from England reach Sydney in about 31 days.

The number passing through the Post Office in 1914 was:

- Letters and Postcards ... 217,907,644
- Newspapers ... ... ... 66,216,699
- Packets and Book Parcels ... 34,203,574
- Parcels ... ... ... 2,372,964

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Public Instruction Act of 1880. Teachers in State schools belong to the Public Service and are paid fixed salaries according to their qualifications and the classifications of their schools. Fees in State primary and superior public schools were abolished from the 8th October, 1906, and State High School fees were abolished at the close of 1910. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

At the close of 1915 there were 3,254 State schools divided into 17 high schools, 6 for boys, 4 for girls and 7 mixed; public schools, 1,963; provisional schools, 486; half-time schools, 185; house-to-house school, 1; travelling schools, 3; evening continuation schools, 47; subsidised schools, 548; and industrial and reformatory schools, 2. The State has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district or sub-district. School buildings are erected and maintained wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective Churches to pupils belonging to the same religious persuasion. Children are conveyed to central schools, and in very thinly-populated remote districts subsidies are paid either to families who combine and engage teachers, or to single families of 4 children and upwards: in the latter case it may take the form of assisting to board the children near existing schools. Three properly equipped travelling schools convey a means of instruction to several outlying groups in rotation. All children are carried free by rail to the nearest school, while conveyances are subsidised by the Department to carry pupils residing in an outlying district to a Central School.

Four hundred and twenty Bursaries, each tenable for four years at a High or District School are awarded annually. Hitherto 600 Scholarships were awarded each year. These Scholarships,
which carried a free grant of text books have been discontinued, as free text books are now supplied to all High School pupils. Agricultural Scholarships, Technical Scholarships, and thirty University Bursaries are also awarded. A Higher Education Scheme has been established which provides for the award of (1) Qualifying Certificates which denote that pupils have undergone a primary course of instruction and are eligible to receive higher instruction either in the High or District Schools, or in the advanced classes of the superior Public Schools. (2) Intermediate Certificates issued on the satisfactory completion of a two years' High School course, and (3) Leaving Certificates (equivalent to the University Matriculation Certificates) awarded on the satisfactory completion of a four years' High School course. Sixteen High Schools and an Agricultural High School are in operation. Probationary student Scholarships are provided for young persons desiring to enter the Public Service as teachers, and the Training College affords a one-year or two-years' course of training for State school teachers. In special cases longer courses are provided for. Classifications are awarded on attainments and practical skill.

During 1914, 408 students underwent courses of training. In addition, 375 students were received during the year into a short (6 months') course of training preparatory to taking charge of small bush State Schools, or of receiving appointments as assistants in country schools. During 1912 the "Bursary Endowment Act" was passed by Parliament. This Act provides for the establishment of a fund for Bursaries tenable in secondary schools and in the Sydney University and for the constitution of a Board of Control. The first set of Bursaries (300) awarded under this Act took effect from 1st January, 1913.

Evening Continuation Schools have been brought into operation in city and country centres divided into the following classes: (1) Junior Technical Schools; (2) Commercial Schools—in both cases the object being to assist lads to push on more rapidly in the callings they have chosen; and (3) Domestic Schools, for girls only.

For the year 1915 the net cost to the State of public instruction was £683,154., exclusive of £78,129. expended on technical education.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1850. Its State endowment was originally £5,000., and from 1890 to 1892 was £13,900., but it has recently been increased to £21,000. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The State endowment and special grants for 1915 amounted to £44,325. Three-denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of £500. per annum. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated, having a similar endowment. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, engineering, agriculture, veterinary science and dentistry. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. During 1912 the University Amendment Act was passed the main provisions being representation of the Government and of Parliament upon the Senate; the broadening of the franchise; voting by post; the acceptance of the Leaving Certificate of the Education Department as the equivalent of Matriculation, the institution of Evening Tutorial Classes, and the provision of 200 Exhibitions annually exempting the holders from payment of fees.

In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 638 pupils, and having a State endowment of £1,500. There are also technical colleges, under the Department of Public Instruction, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns. The Central College—a large establishment—is extensively equipped and staffed for trades, professional, and scientific instruction. The fees are within the reach of all, and the colleges are open to males and females alike. There is an Australian Museum, a National Art Gallery, a Public Library, including the Mitchell Library, with endowments of £1,000., £2,000., and £2,000., respectively, and a Music Library. Public libraries and schools of arts are established throughout the State and obtain Government subsidies. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, a Geographical, and an Art Society, a Government Observatory, Agricultural and Forestry Museum, and a Mining and Geological, and Technological Museums, Government Agricultural Colleges, Experimental Farms, with many other educational associations.

Local Government.

Local Government throughout New South Wales is governed by the Local Government Acts, 1906–1908.

The greater part of the State is incorporated, leaving only the "Western Division," which is but sparsely settled, outside the scope of these Acts, though even in that division there are a few towns which, having been incorporated as Municipalities under the Municipalities Act of 1897, now repealed, are governed by the new law.

There are two kinds of Local Government organisation—viz., Shires and Municipalities. Speaking generally, the Municipal form of organisation is applied to towns, the Shire form to the open country outside the towns. There are 136 Shires and 184 Municipalities.

Shires.

The Shires were incorporated on 7th March, 1906. Each Shire is divided into three Ridings, with six exceptions, which upon reconstitution were each divided into six Ridings.

The First Council of a Shire consists of six members, each Riding, in Shires divided into three Ridings, electing two Councillors. In Shires divided into six Ridings, as in the cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, each Riding elects one Councillor.

For the purpose of any later election the number of members may be increased from six to nine on resolution of the Council, or where such increase has been made may be decreased to six, provided that before any such increase or decrease is made the Council must take a poll of electors on the question, and the decision of a majority of the votes cast at such poll determines the question.

The election of Councillors is held triennially, the last election having taken place on 31st January, 1914.

Included amongst the primary functions imposed upon Shire Councils are the following:—The control of all roads, bridges, public watering places for travelling stock, and wharves and jetties, the lighting of streets, the regulation of traffic, etc. The Shire Councils may, under the Act, largely extend their powers, and take up many duties not at present part of their work, and many Councils are availing themselves of this provision in the Act.
To obtain the revenue they require, the Councils levy general rates not less than 1d., nor more than 2d., in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of ratable land (i.e., the value the land would realise in the open market if it had no improvements on it, but with the rest of the surrounding district in its present state of development).

For special purposes Shire Councils may levy "special" or "local" rates, subject to the right of the ratepayers to demand a poll, at which the rate may be vetoed. Shire Councils are empowered by the Local Government (Shire Loans) Act, 1914, to borrow with the Governor's approval, up to thrice the amount of a year's income, for the purpose of carrying out any work which they are by law authorised to undertake.

On the petition of ten per centum of the ratepayers, the Council is required to submit the proposal to a poll of ratepayers, and if a majority of the votes cast at the poll is against the proposal, the borrowing cannot be proceeded with. Loans under the Shire Loans Act are a charge on the income of the General Fund.

Shire Councils may also obtain temporary accommodation to the extent of one-third of a current year's rate revenue.

In the case of portions of Shires which have been declared, by notification of the Governor to be "Urban Areas," the Shire Councils concerned may exercise all the powers of the Council of a Municipality, including the powers to borrow granted to Municipalities by the Local Government Act, 1906. This is intended to enable the financing of services and works required in unincorporated towns in Shires, where conditions akin to those of a Municipality obtain, but where the circumstances are not such as to warrant the incorporation of such centres as Municipalities. The question of whether any locality shall be declared an Urban Area is subject to a poll of the ratepayers of the locality concerned, in the event of such a poll being demanded.

To assist Shire Councils the Act provides that they shall be classified once every three years, and that not less than 150,000l. shall be distributed as endowment in accordance with the classification.

A sum of approximately 200,000l. is distributed amongst the Shire Councils annually for the upkeep of the main roads.

For the ten years previous to the passing of the Local Government Act the Government of New South Wales levied a direct tax of 1d., in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of land, and this tax was taken into Consolidated Revenue. The Local Government Act provides that when a Shire Council levies a rate on the Unimproved Capital Value of land the Government land tax shall be suspended. The whole of the Shire Councils having levied such a rate, the land tax has been suspended throughout the whole of the area covered by the Shires.

Municipalities.

The Municipalities Act of 1867, and its Amending Acts, which were consolidated in 1897, have been swept away, and the Municipal organisation brought into line with that of the Shires. The new law came into force on 1st January, 1907, the day on which the newly elected Shire Councils took up their task.

The election of Aldermen is held once in three years, the last election having been held at the same time as the Shire elections, viz., on 31st January, 1914. The old system of the retirement of one-third of the Aldermen each year has disappeared—all go out of office on the same day.

The functions of Municipal Councils under the old law were confined within certain very circumscribed limits, which they had outgrown owing to the rapid progress of the State and the growth of town life. The Local Government Act, 1906, makes provision for any Council to extend very widely its sphere of activity as necessity occurs, so that it is possible now for a Municipality to undertake the conduct of an infants' milk depot, or a public mortuary, or to regulate the erection of buildings or the sub-division of land for building sites, with many other powers.

The financial system also has been completely revolutionised. Under the old Municipalities Act all rates were levied on rental values. During the first year of the operation of the new Act this system was continued. From 1st January, 1908, all Municipal rates have been levied either on the Unimproved or Improved Capital Value. The whole of the General Purposes requirements may be levied by a General Rate (which must not be less than 1d., and may be any higher number of pence in the £ within the limit given below) on the Unimproved Capital Value of ratable land. If the Council prefers, it may levy only part of General Purposes requirements as a General Rate on Unimproved Capital Value, and the rest as an Additional General Rate on either the Unimproved Capital Value or Improved Capital Value. Similarly, any special, local or loan rates may be levied on either Unimproved Capital Value or Improved Capital Value as Council may decide. In all these cases, however, except in the case of "General" Rates, the ratepayers may demand a poll, and at the poll may decide whether the rate is to be on the Unimproved or the Improved Capital Value. With respect to special and local rates the poll may also decide whether the rate shall be levied at all.

The limit of all rates (general, additional general, special, local and loan) taken together is fixed by the Act at a sum calculated by taking 2d., in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value and 2s. in the £ on the assessed annual value. The products of these two calculations are added together; and the total which results is the limit beyond which a Council cannot levy rates. The limit under the old Municipalities Act was 2s. in the £ on nine-tenths of the rental value.

As to loans, the Local Government Act introduces the principle that wherever a Council proposes to borrow (except to repay an existing loan) they shall first submit the proposal to a poll of ratepayers. If the poll approve of the loan, then before raising it a loan rate must be levied sufficient to pay interest and sinking fund contributions in respect thereof; and this rate must be continued until the loan is wholly repaid.

The new law also provides for the introduction of uniformity into municipal accounts, the Government being empowered to make regulations prescribing the manner in which the accounts are to be kept.

Regulations made in pursuance of the Local Government Act require the accounts to be kept by double entry on a system of "Income and Expenditure." The accounts of municipalities in the past were, generally speaking, kept on a "Cash" System, by single entry.

In Municipalities, as in Shires, the State Land Tax disappeared on the Councils levying general rates on the Unimproved Capital Value of all ratable land.
A sum of approximately £50,000 is distributed annually amongst the Municipal Councils for the upkeep of the main roads.

**Constitution.**

The first Legislative Council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1835). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers on H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council were appointed for five years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 52 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry. All members are privileged to travel free over all Government Railways and Tramways.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1889," consisted of 108 members, elected in 72 districts increased under the provisions of that Act, which provides for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population, and the "Wentworth Electorate Subdivision Act" to 141 members in 1891 for 74 districts. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise was given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in district."
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of £100, or of the annual value of £10 respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district, any house of the annual value of £10, or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

An Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provided for the division of the State into 125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The new Act also abolished the property qualification and plural voting, and established the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalised subject, and who shall have resided in the State for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. As the qualification of electors who held Electors' Rights had been tested at Revision Courts, the residence necessary in the new district, on change of residence from one district to another, was reduced from three months to one month, during which period the elector is entitled to vote in the original electorate. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day. The first election under this Act took place on July 17th, 1894; the second on July 24th, 1895; the third on July 27th, 1896; and the fourth on July 3rd, 1901. Under an amending Act, passed in 1896, the franchise has been conferred on members of the police force, who are all in the employment of the State, and not controlled by local bodies.

The Electoral Acts were consolidated in 1902, and during that year the franchise was extended to women.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old Electoral Acts of 1858 and 1880, now repealed.

Early in 1904 the State was divided into 90 electorates, each of which has one member to represent it in the Legislative Assembly. The General Election, held in August, 1904, was the first election held after the new divisions had been made, and at which women exercised the franchise.

The electoral law was amended by the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1906, which abolished the system of elector's rights, and substituted therefor provisions for collection of Lists, the exhibition and revision of same before being printed as Rolls.

Under this Act a General Election was held on the 10th September, 1907. The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Members receive £500 per annum each; and, in addition, they may also travel free over the Government railways and tramways in the State, and are provided with official stamped envelopes for the transmission of correspondence through the post.

The Parliamentary Elections (Second Ballot) Act, 1910, was assented to on the 31st August, 1910. It provides that if, as the result of the first ballot, the Returning Officer finds that no candidate has received an absolute majority of votes, a second ballot shall be taken between the candidate who has received the highest number of votes and the candidate who has received the next highest number of votes. It also provides for the revision of all supplemental rolls before every general election after the issue of the writs.

The necessary residential qualification has been altered by this Act, so that a continuous residence of one year in the Commonwealth, six months at least of such period in the State and three months in the District is sufficient. The Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act, 1911, was assented to on 3rd October, 1911. It provides for an annual collection and revision of the Lists and consequent printing of the rolls, and that every person whose name so entered on the Lists is to receive a form of acknowledgment and every applicant for enrolment is to be notified by post if his name has been added to the roll or if his application has been refused. It also provides that an elector absent from the district for which he or she is enrolled may vote for that district at any polling place in any other electorate. The residential qualification has also been altered to six months in the Commonwealth, three months in the State, and one month in the district, and the hours of polling extended to seven o'clock in the evening.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Latitude, 31° 30' S. Longitude 159° 5' E.
This island lies 436 miles north-east from Sydney, and 300 miles from Port Macquarie, the nearest part of the Australian continent.
It was discovered on February 17th, 1788, by Lieutenant H. L. Ball, of H.M.S. "Supply," while on his way from Port Jackson to found a settlement at Norfolk Island. It is of volcanic origin and crescent shaped, about seven miles in length and from one-half to one-and-three-quarters in width, containing about 3,220 acres. It is of great beauty throughout and covered with a dense and most luxuriant vegetation, but from the peculiar bouldery character of the formation of the major part of its floor, it has scarcely more than 300 acres suitable for agriculture. The soil of these few acres is extremely rich, and will produce almost any sub-tropical vegetation.
No lands have been sold, and the people pay no rent, occupying the land upon sufferance only—the Government reserving the right of resuming whenever they may see fit.
The population in April, 1911, was 105. Very fair and comfortable accommodation can be obtained amongst the settlers. The natural beauties of the island render it most attractive to visitors. Fish are very plentiful, and good sport can consequently be had. A five-weekly steam service is in existence, instituted by Burns, Philp and Co., under contract to the Government.

The Island is a dependency of New South Wales and the Government of New South Wales have appointed a Board of Control consisting of G. H. S. King, Esquire (Chairman Metropolitan Meat Industry Board), Chairman; and A. Salwey, Esquire (Assistant Under-Secretary Department of Agriculture); and H. Langwell, Commissioner Western Land Board of N.S.W., Members. The Board take charge of the affairs of the Island, and the management and control of the Kentia palm seed industry. Lord Howe Island is the home of the Kentia palms, the hardiest and most beautiful palms in the world, and the seeds are collected and sold under the Board's direction. Thousands of bushels of these seeds are shipped annually to all parts of the world.
