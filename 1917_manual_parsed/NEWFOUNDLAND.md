NEWFOUNDLAND.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 42,000 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom. Population, 250,707.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Hudson's Strait to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound, the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,300 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Hebron, Ramah, and Killinek. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norseman Lief, son of Eric the Red, in A.D. 1,000, and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863 and again in 1909. During the summer months several Justices of the Peace are upon the coast.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieuc, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they were allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right was an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it did not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (see Cd. 1952). The arrangement will be of great benefit to the Colony, since it removes an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Dried cod is the largest export (1,094,242 qts. in 1915); other large exports are herrings, lobsters, salmon, iron, fish oils, seal skins, and timber. Copper is worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pillay's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The establishment of large and well-equipped paper mills at Grand Falls, in the interior, by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, has opened up a very large industry. The paper and paper pulp is shipped to the United Kingdom and used in the principal London printing offices. Mr. Mayson M. Beeton, the president of the company, has been instrumental in laying out a model town, which is well lighted, watered, and drained. It is very picturesquely situated, and is on the line of the Reid Newfoundland Company's railway through the interior, while a private line of rail connects the works with Botwood, the principal port on the Exploits for summer shipments.

The Albert Reed Company, of London, have completed a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about nine miles from Grand Falls, where pulp is
Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable is landed at St. John's, the Direct cable at Harbour Grace,
being manufactured for English mills. This company have also installed machinery for the manufacture of paper.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1913-14 was 1,247,314 quintals, value $8,071,889; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Commerce have been opened in St. John's, branches of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace and in eleven other towns; branches of the Bank of Montreal at Bay of Islands and Grand Falls; and a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada at Trinity.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1895) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4-80$ to the pound sterling.

In the Savings Bank deposits in 1915 were $2,411,946.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $525,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, rid Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Portaux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,446,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, Carbonear, and Burnt Bay are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. Other branch lines have been constructed to Trinity, Bonavista, Hearts' Content, Grate's Cove and Trepassey, in all about 189 miles. Contracts have been entered into for the construction of branch lines to Fortune Bay and Bonne Bay. By the transinsular railway regular connection is made with the continent daily, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamers "Bruce" and "Lintroce," which make the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 4,897 miles of telegraph open. The Government cable, laid in 1905 between Portaux-Basques and Canso in Nova Scotia, gives quick communication with both America and Europe. The Anglo-American cables start for Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable is landed at St. John's, the Direct cable at Harbour Grace, and the Western Union at Bay Roberts, and all connect with both Europe and America. There is a fortnightly mail service (except in February, March and April) with Liverpool by the Allan line, and at irregular intervals by other steamers. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The south and west coast has a weekly steamer service from Placentia, and also a fortnightly service per steamer from St. John's. Two steamers make trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer at intervals of eight to ten days, and another makes fortnightly trips between St. John's and Griguet in the north of the island, calling at all the important intermediate settlements. Smaller steamers ply on the five great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, per 1 oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|------------|
| In St. John's     | 1 cent     | Free if under 4 oz. |
| Within Colony     | 2 cents    | ,, ditto. |
| To United Kingdom | 2 ,,        | 1 cent for 2 oz. |
| and certain Colonies* | ,, | ,, ditto. |
| Other Colonies    | 5 ,,        | ,, ditto. |
| Europe and St. Pierre, Miquelon South America | 5 cents for 1st oz., 3 cents per succeeding oz. | ,, ditto. |
| To United States  | 2 cents    | ,, ditto. |

In 1915 there were 3,860 miles of telegraphs, and 922 of telephones.

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's in the year 1906 was 42°, the extreme range being from 0° to 81°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1906 was 64 inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1903. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There were, in 1915, 1,323 schools, with 56,307 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and in the session of 1905 a small vote of $3,767 was passed for technical education. In 1910 a special grant of $100,000 was made for the erection, re-modelling and equipment of school buildings in places outside the city of St. John's.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object

* See end of Introduction. A new rate for postage on magazines, etc., from U.K. to Newfoundland came into effect, December 1st, 1909—a reduction from id. to ld.
of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 33,779 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 4,279; Twillingate has 3,348; Bonavista 3,911; and Carbonear 3,540 inhabitants. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1835. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1913—61,451 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding $500. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $120 each (President $240) per session. Members of the Assembly receive the following pay per session:—(1) Those living in St. John's, $200; (2) those living in the outports, $300. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a Board of Commissioners, consisting of twelve members, appointed by the Governor in Council under the Act of the Legislature, 4 Geo. V., cap. x.

NEWFOUNDLAND.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 42,000 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom. Population, 250,707.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Hudson's Strait to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound, the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,300 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Hebron, Ramah, and Killinek. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norseman Lief, son of Eric the Red, in A.D. 1000, and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863 and again in 1909. During the summer months several Justices of the Peace are upon the coast.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise the island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieuc, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they were allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right was an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it did not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (see Cd. 1952). The arrangement will be of great benefit to the Colony, since it removes an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Dried cod is the largest export (1,094,242 qts., in 1915); other large exports are herrings, lobsters, salmon, iron, fish oils, seal skins, and timber. Copper is worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead. Silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The establishment of large and well-equipped paper mills at Grand Falls, in the interior, by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, has opened up a very large industry. The paper and paper pulp is shipped to the United Kingdom and used in the principal London printing offices. Mr. Mayson M. Beeton, the president of the company, has been instrumental in laying out a model town, which is well lighted, watered, and drained. It is very picturesquely situated, and is on the line of the Reid Newfoundland Company's railway through the interior, while a private line of rail connects the works with Botwood, the principal port on the Exploits for summer shipments.

The Albert Reed Company, of London, have completed a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about nine miles from Grand Falls, where pulp is
Europe (at Heart's Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable is landed at St. John's, the Direct cable at Harbour Grace,
being manufactured for English mills. This company have also installed machinery for the manufacture of paper.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1913–14 was 1,247,314 quintals, value $8,071,889; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Commerce have been opened in St. John's, branches of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace and in eleven other towns; branches of the Bank of Montreal at Bay of Islands and Grand Falls; and a branch of the Royal Bank of Canada at Trinity.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1895) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4.86½ to the pound sterling.

In the Savings Bank deposits in 1915 were $2,411,946.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $325,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, rid Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,446,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, Carbonear, and Burnt Bay are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. Other branch lines have been constructed to Trinity, Bonavista, Hearts' Content, Grate's Cove and Trepassey, in all about 189 miles. Contracts have been entered into for the construction of branch lines to Fortune Bay and Bonne Bay. By the transinsular railway regular connection is made with the continent daily, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamers "Bruce" and "Lintrose," which make the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 4,897 miles of telegraph open. The Government cable, laid in 1905 between Port-aux-Basques and Canso in Nova Scotia, gives quick communication with both America and Europe. The Anglo-American cables start for Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable is landed at St. John's, the Direct cable at Harbour Grace, and the Western Union at Bay Roberts, and all connect with both Europe and America. There is a fortnightly mail service (except in February, March and April) with Liverpool by the Allan line, and at irregular intervals by other steamers. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The south and west coast has a weekly steamer service from Placentia, and also a fortnightly service per steamer from St. John's. Two steamers make trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer at intervals of eight to ten days, and another makes fortnightly trips between St. John's and Griguet in the north of the island, calling at all the important intermediate settlements. Smaller steamers ply on the five great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| In St. John's . . . | 1 cent | Free if under |
| Within Colony . . . | 2 cents | 4 oz. |
| To United Kingdom and certain Colonies* | 2 ,, | 1 cent for 2 oz. |
| Other Colonies . . . | 5 ,, | 1 ,, ditto. |
| Europe and St. Pierre, Miquelon | 5 cents for 1st oz. | 1 ,, ditto. |
| South America . . . | 3 cents per succeeding oz. | 1 ,, ditto. |
| To United States . . | 2 cents |

In 1915 there were 3,860 miles of telegraphs, and 922 of telephones.

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's in the year 1906 was 42°, the extreme range being from 0° to 81°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1906 was 64 inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1903. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There were, in 1915, 1,323 schools, with 56,307 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and in the session of 1905 a small vote of $3,767 was passed for technical education. In 1910 a special grant of $100,000 was made for the erection, re-modelling and equipment of school buildings in places outside the city of St. John's.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object

*See end of Introduction. A new rate for postage on magazines, etc., from U.K. to Newfoundland came into effect, December 1st, 1909—a reduction from 4d. to ld.
of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 33,779 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 4,279; Twillingate has 3,348; Bonavista 3,911; and Carbonear 3,540 inhabitants. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1913—61,451 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding £500 in amount or value, or a net annual income of £100. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $120 each (President $240) per session. Members of the Assembly receive the following pay per session:—(1) Those living in St. John's, $200; (2) those living in the outports, $300. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a Board of Commissioners, consisting of twelve members, appointed by the Governor in Council under the Act of the Legislature, 4 Geo. V., cap. x.
