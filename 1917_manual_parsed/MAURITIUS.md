MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 48' E. long., and 19° 50' and 20° 31' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 934 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 720 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), having an extreme length of 39 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 29 miles from east to west.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude. The highest peak, the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, is 2,711 English feet, and Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable for any distance from the sea.

History.

The island was discovered by the Portuguese between 1506 and 1528. Although neither the date of the event nor the name of the discoverer can be ascertained with accuracy, tradition has attributed its discovery to Pedro Mascarenhas. The island at that time went under the name of Santa Appollonia, which was later changed to Cirne. The Portuguese merely used the island as a port of call, without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch. In 1598 a Dutch fleet landed in the South-Eastern harbour of the island, to which its commander, Admiral Wybrandt Van Warwyk, gave the name of Mauritius, in honour of the Statholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. For many years no attempt
was made at colonisation, but from 1638 downwards petty settlements were established at various points, the seat of government being at Port South East, at the place known as Old Grand Port. The colony did not prosper, and finally was abandoned by the Dutch in 1710.

In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French, but was not actually occupied till 1721, when a small party of colonists were sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The island was then named Isle de France. This name was retained until the landing of the English in 1810, when the former name of Mauritius was restored. Of all the Governors of the island, the most celebrated was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735-1746), "a man of eminent talents" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who encouraged the cultivation of sugar-cane and introduced many other valuable plants. He was the real founder of the prosperity of the Isle de France.

In 1767, the French East India Company, having gone into liquidation, handed over the island to the Crown, Jean Daniel Dumas being appointed Governor General for the King, and Pierre Poivre, Intendant. Poivre was a man of great ability; he introduced into the colony cloves and nutmegs secretly obtained from the Dutch Sunda Archipelago. Having purchased the ancient residence of the Company's Governors, at Monplaisir, he converted the grounds into a nursery where many useful plants introduced by him were cultivated. On his departure this property was sold to Government, the garden being entrusted to Poivre's friend, Nicolas Céré, under whose able management it became famous under the name of King's Gardens. It is now the Royal Botanical Gardens, Pamplemousses.

In 1771 an epidemic of smallpox caused many deaths among the slave population.

In 1790, at the outbreak of the French Revolution, a Colonial Assembly was elected, which for 13 years governed the island de facto.

In 1792 another very popular Governor was sent out from France, Comte de Malartic, who during this troubled period managed to gain the affection of the whole community. In 1803, the Isle de France was taken charge of by General Decaen, appointed Captain General by Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul, with instructions to suspend the Colonial Assembly and the Isle de France's constitution for a period of ten years.

During the long war between England and France, the Isle de France was a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, owing to the facility with which sorties were made from its harbour by French men-of-war and privateers; and in 1809 the British Government determined on its capture. The neighbouring islands of Rodrigues and Reunion were taken possession of and several naval engagements were fought to the credit of both navies. The most famous of these was the battle of the Isle de la Passe, fought in the bay of Grand Port on the 23rd and 24th August, 1810, between four English frigates and two French frigates, a corvette and a captured East Indiaman. The English were defeated, two of their ships having gone on shoals early in the engagement, but the great gallantry shown by both sides has rendered the fight memorable in the annals of the two navies.

A strong expeditionary force was then sent out from the three presidencies of India and the Cape. Twelve thousand troops under General Abercrombie were landed, and the island finally surrendered to Great Britain on December 3rd, 1810, the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation.

The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The first English Governor, Mr. (later Sir) R. T. Farquhar (1810-1823) gained a well-deserved popularity. During his tenure of office, on 25th September, 1816, the fourth part of the town of Port Louis was destroyed by a conflagration. On 28th February, 1818, the island was laid waste by a terrific cyclone, causing immense destruction to property.

In 1826-27, owing to the abolition of the 10s. extra duty on every hundredweight of Mauritius sugar imported into the United Kingdom, the output of this article, which was a little short of 500 tons in 1812 and had gradually increased to 12,000 tons in 1823, suddenly rose to 20,000 tons.

In the year 1832, the Council of Government which was established on the 19th August, 1825, was abolished, and a Legislative Council, with half the members official, created. The oaths of office were taken by the new members on the 23rd January, 1832.

On the 1st April, 1835, the emancipation of slaves took place without disorder; but as this new class of free men refused employment as labourers the planters were obliged to resort to the introduction of labour from India which was finally authorised in 1842, under the supervision of an agent residing in India, and which continued, with temporary interruptions, until 1910.

In 1849, the Legislative Council voted the law constituting a municipal corporation for the town of Port Louis.

During the years 1854, 1856, 1861-62, epidemics of cholera prevailed, of which that of 1854 was the most severe, causing 7,650 deaths.

The year 1864 saw the opening of the North Railway Line from Port Louis to Pamplemousses, the Midland Line being inaugurated two years after.

In December, 1866, malaria broke out with great severity. During the year 1867, 31,758 persons died from fever, including 18,308 in Port Louis.

In 1868 and 1874, Mauritius was visited by severe hurricanes. During the former two spans of the Grand River Railway Viaduct were brought down by the force of the wind. On the 29th April, 1892, one of the most violent cyclones ever recorded ruined a considerable portion of Port Louis, besides causing infinite havoc to buildings and crops. The death roll amounted to 1,232. In order to assist the planters and other owners of immovable property affected by the calamity, a loan of £500,000 was guaranteed by the Imperial Government.

On the 23rd of July, 1893, part of Port Louis was again destroyed by fire. At the end of the same year ocean telegraphic communication was opened.

In 1902, an outbreak of Surra caused great loss of draught animals, and mechanical means of transport had to be resorted to for the sugar plantations. A number of locomotives and traction engines were introduced, and a loan was raised to enable the planters to lay down tramways, and take other steps to provide for transport. New machinery and improved processes in the sugar manufacture are being constantly adopted.

In 1909, a Royal Commission visited the Island to enquire into the administration and finances of the Colony.
General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture. The natives are proud of their country, and of the designation of Creoles.

Nine daily newspapers and five other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island, English being used in the courts of justice. Debates in the Council of Government may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of 50,060 souls (census 1911). The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal corporation, and raised in 1915 a revenue of Rs. 547,745, against an expenditure of Rs. 558,232. Its debts amount to 115,497l. and Rs. 26,109.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals, the Civil Hospital, the Town Hall, the theatre, and the public offices.

After Port Louis, the largest town is Curepipe, incorporated in 1890 (population 17,173, census of 1911), situated on the uplands in the Plaines Wilhems. Its climate is temperate.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg (population 3,505, census of 1911), so called in honour of Mahé de Labourdonnais.

Population.

At the Census of 1911 the population of Mauritius (exclusive of the Dependencies, but including Military) was found to consist of:

| Persons of European, African, or mixed descent | 108,844 |
| Indo-Mauritians, i.e., persons of Indian descent, born in Mauritius | 222,361 |
| Other Indians | 36,526* |
| Chinese | 3,662 |

The total number of Indians was thus 257,887, or 69·6 per cent. of the total population.

The descendants of the immigrants from India—the Indo-Mauritians—now form the largest section of the population; they are steadily increasing in numbers. They are predominant in the domestic, commercial, and still more in the agricultural callings, and the amount of land held by them as small planters is rapidly growing.

Constitution.

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of four ex-officio members, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex-officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected—two for the town of Port Louis, and one for each of the eight rural districts. At least one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any public office. Members are not paid; they may speak either in French or English. The number of registered electors on 1st January, 1916, was 6,170; the franchise qualification is ownership of immovables of annual value of Rs. 300, or movables worth Rs. 3,000, or payment of rent of Rs. 25 monthly, or of license duty of Rs. 200 annually, or receipt of salary of Rs. 50 monthly. The session usually lasts from April to December.

The law is based on the Code Napoléon, and other French laws modified by Colonial Ordinances.

Climate, &c.

From December to April is the hottest season in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature on the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The climate at Curepipe, from 1,700 to 1,900 feet above the sea, resembles that of the South of France or Italy. The hurricane season extends officially from December to the end of April, but cyclones occur in the Indian Ocean eastward of Mauritius, from the equator down to 30° S. latitude, in every month of the year, except August and September.

No cyclone had been recorded within 100 miles of Mauritius after the 29th April until, on May 26th, 1916, a centre passed about 80 miles eastward, giving rise to a strong gale, and causing some damage to crops in the east, south-east and south.

Mean Annual Rainfall.

The mean rainfall in 1915 from 42 stations was 58·20 inches as compared with 59·10 inches in 1914 and an average of 75·84 inches.

Water Supply.

The Town of Port Louis is supplied by the Grand River N.W. and a reservoir was built at the end of the Champ de Mars by the Municipality. This source is not altogether satisfactory.

The Mare aux Vacoas works were started by the Government in 1895, they were extended in 1893-95 by the addition of a filtering establishment. The whole of the district of Plaines Wilhems and a part of Moka are now supplied with pure water from these works and a small main was also laid to supply the Barracks and Fort in Port Louis and also the Government Establishments and soda water factories. These works have cost about 2,000,000 rupees and the revenue derived Rs. 50,000 now exceeds the cost of the upkeep.

The water supply of other districts is under the control of other Local Boards and with the co-operation of the Government, works have been undertaken to distribute water from upland springs to the villages in the country districts; these works are now completed for some districts and in course of execution in others.

Scenery.

The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the 18th century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of
large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

**Railways.**

There are seven lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government, viz.: (1) The North line, from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River South-east. Its length is 31 miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Montagne Longue branch from Terre Rouge station on the North Line to the village of Montagne Longue; its length is 34 miles. (3) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahebourg on the other side; its length is 35-3 miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet at Curéville; the gradient in many places is 1 in 27. (4) The Moka-Placq line from the Rose Hill station on the Midland line to Rivière Sèche station on the North line; length 26-2 miles. (5) Savanne branch from Rosebelle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 10-90 miles. (6) Black River branch, from Richelieu on the Midland line to Tamarin, distance 12-75 miles. (7) Rivière du Poste to Mexico, length 10 miles. All the above are of standard gauge, 4' 8½", except the 7th which is 76 centimetres (2' 6"). The total number of miles of railway now open is 119-65 of standard gauge and 10 of 2' 6" gauge, the total cost up to date being about 2,164,669L. The receipts in 1915 were Rs. 3,155,510 (including traffic done for other Government departments), and expenditure, Rs. 2,222,060, not including the charge on account of Railway Loans.

**Religion.**

The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the census of 1911, the Roman Catholics numbered 122,424, and the Protestants about 7,000, including Dependencies and Military. The Roman Catholics received in 1914-15 Government aid amounting to Rs. 111,520 and the Protestants Rs. 41,116.

**Education.**

The system of education was remodelled by Ordinance No. 33 of 1899 (brought into force on 21st August, 1900), and all former enactments on the subject were repealed. This Ordinance was amended in some important respects by Ordinance No. 35 of 1913.

Under the Education Ordinance of 1899, a Department of Public Instruction was created which is under the charge of an officer styled "The Director of Public Instruction."

The Department provides for Primary, Secondary and Technical Education: (1) Primary Education is carried on through a system of Government schools and of grant-in-aid Denominational Schools, the latter under the immediate control of local managers. (2) Secondary Education is done by the Government Royal College for boys, under the immediate control of a Rector, and a system of grant-in-aid schools for boys and girls. (3) Under Technical Education, provision has been made for the training of Students in Engineering, Mechanical and Civil, and in Horticulture, and for the training of teachers.

An Advisory Committee, styled the Committee of Public Instruction, is annually appointed, primarily for the purpose of framing regulations for the administration of the Department. It may also be consulted, and has the power to advise *proprio motu*, on any question connected with the education of youth in the Colony. The Committee consists of 11 members. The Director of Public Instruction and the Rector of the Royal College are members *ex-officio*; the primary and secondary grant-in-aid schools nominate 5 members; and 5 members are chosen by the Governor. The Director is Chairman of the Committee.

The Director is responsible for carrying out all regulations dealing with the education of youth in the colony, but the exercise of the powers conferred upon him is subject to an appeal to the Governor in Executive Council.

**Higher Education.**

On the books of the Royal College on the 31st December, 1915, there were 208 pupils.

**Primary Education.**

There were in 1915—

| Number. | Pupils. |
|---------|--------|
| Government schools | 57 | 10,127 |
| Grant schools | 91 | 12,638 |
| **Total** | **148** | **22,765** |

**Total Number of Pupils.**

The relative numbers according to religion are shown by the following percentages:

- Church of England: 2%
- Roman Catholic: 59%
- Other Christian denominations: 1%
- Mohammedan: 11%
- Hindoos and others: 27%

The total expenditure on education in 1915 amounted to Rs. 586,183. There are 700 masters, mistresses, assistants, and monitors and matronesses employed in Government and Grant Schools. Of the pupils in the aided schools 61 per cent. are Roman Catholics, 18 per cent. belong to the Church of England, and 08 per cent. to other Christian denominations. One Hindu and two Mohammedan schools are also assisted.

**Communications.**

The mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes leave Marseilles every fortnight (on Thursdays), arriving in Mauritius at intervals of 19 and 9 days, and leaving Mauritius at intervals of 18 and 10 days, each steamer staying 3 or 4 days in Mauritius. There is a four-weekly service with England, *via* the Cape of Good Hope, by the steamers of the Union-Castle line. The British India Steam Navigation Company provides a direct four-weekly service between Colombo and Mauritius. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Réunion, &c.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication is established along and beyond the railway, the total length of line being 432 miles of telegraph and 120 of telephone; and cable communication through a branch office of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company with Europe, *via* Seychelles, Zanzibar, and Aden, was opened in
November, 1893. Through rate: United Kingdom to Mauritius, 3s. per word; and from Mauritius to United Kingdom, Rs. 1-90. The laying of the Mauritius section of the Cape-Australian cable, via Rodrigues, was completed on May 16, 1902.

There are in Mauritius the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 62 branch post offices in the rural districts, 62 money order offices, 56 telegraph and 41 telephone offices. In the island of Rodrigues there is one post office at Port Mathurin. There is no post office on any other of the Dependencies. The rates of postage are:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| United Kingdom, and British Possessions, &c., which have adopted the Imperial Penny Postage | 6 cents |
| Dependencies of Mauritius | 4 cents |
| Other countries of the Postal Union or non-Union Countries | 15 cents |

Parcels Post Rates.—For parcels addressed to the United Kingdom.

| Via France | Via Colombo |
|------------|-------------|
| Rs. c.     | Rs. c.      |
| Not over 1 kilo 361 grs. | Not over 3 lbs. 75 grs. |
| Over 1 kilo 361 kilos and not over 3 kilos 175 grs. | Over 3 lbs. but not over 7 lbs. |
| Over 3 kilos 175 kilos and not over 5 kilos | Over 7 lbs. but not over 11 lbs. |

Commerce.

The island produces hardly anything for its own consumption, but its foreign commerce extends to every quarter of the globe.

The chief exports are sugar, rum, molasses, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, copra, &c. Oxen are imported from Madagascar, frozen meat from Australia, and food-stuffs from India.

The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware, and manure. There is a small tobacco plantation, but sugar production is the greatest industry. About 95 per cent. of the value of the exports is due to shipments of sugar. In 1915 the weight of sugar exported was 225,439,626 kilos., with an estimated value of Rs. 54,105,494. The value of the rum exported was Rs. 34,928; that of vanilla, Rs. 28,560; that of aloe-fibre, Rs. 476,126; that of cocoa-nut oil, Rs. 90,891.

The number of vessels registered at Port Louis is now 31, of a total tonnage of 5,520.

Currency and Banking.

The Mauritius Commercial Bank has establishments in the Colony, the total amount of deposits on 31st Dec., 1915, being Rs. 12,892,590.

The Bank of Mauritius (Limited) was established in October, 1894, with paid up capital of 125,550L, and opened in Mauritius in Dec., 1894. Total deposits up to end of 1915, Rs. 6,311,608. The business of that bank was taken over by the Mercantile Bank of India Limited (subscribed capital 1,125,000L.) on the 3rd May, 1916.

A Government savings bank was established in 1837. The total deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1915, amounted to Rs. 1,292,513. The sum standing to the credit of depositors at the end of June, 1915, was Rs. 3,482,531.

All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is the currency of the island. There are about Rs. 20,470,000 (in coin) in circulation. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The average circulation for the year 1914-15 was Rs. 5,280,250.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Dependencies.

The dependencies of Mauritius comprise a large number of islands scattered over the Indian Ocean.

Rodrigues, the most important, is situated in latitude S. 19° 44' and longitude E. 63° 34', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in executive council. The population (census 1911) is 4,829. Cable communication, through a branch of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company, was opened on 16th May, 1902.

The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good: sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years cultivation has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and vacoa trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, tobacco and fruit.

Diego Garcia (population, 517), the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, fifteen miles by six and a half, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end, and from two to five miles in breadth.
Diego Garcia is situated at 7° 20' latitude S. and 72° 26' longitude E., on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin. In 1885 it was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius, which was, however, withdrawn in 1888.
