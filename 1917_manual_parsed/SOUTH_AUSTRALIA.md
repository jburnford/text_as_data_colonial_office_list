SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vict., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, was also annexed to South Australia, but was on January 1st, 1911, taken over by the Commonwealth. It is known as the Northern Territory.

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 25 m.; area 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, are included in the State.

Adelaide, the capital of the State, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

Early History.

The south coast of the State was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Stuart in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. The South Australian Company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836. Copper was discovered 1842, by Menge. Responsible government was established in 1856. Stuart reached Port Darwin 1861, and the "Northern Territory" was added to the State in 1861 and 1863. (Since transferred to the Commonwealth Government.)

Climate.

The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 63°, the extreme range being from 33° to 111°.

General Government.

The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1855-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 & 14 Vict., cap. 59.

The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added to the Legislative Council, and the Colony was divided into four electoral districts for the purpose of Council elections. In 1882 the House of Assembly...
was further increased to 52 members, representing 26 electoral districts; and by Act No. 450 of 1888, the Northern Territory was created an electoral district, returning two members, thus raising the number to 54. By Act 779 of 1901, the number of members was reduced from 31st March, 1902, to 18 in the Legislative Council and 42 (representing 13 districts) in the House of Assembly. The Northern Territory having been transferred to the Commonwealth Government, the Electoral Districts then numbered 12, returning 40 members. By Act 1148 of 1913 the assembly Districts were altered, and now number 19, returning 46 members.

The five electoral districts of the Legislative Council are—Central No. 1, Central No. 2, Southern, Midland and Northern, each returning four members. (Vide Section 10, Act 959 of 1908, and Section 15 of 1148 of 1913.) Elections are conducted by ballot. (Vide Section 21, Act 959 of 1908.)

The quorum of the Council consists of ten members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the King, and that he has resided in the State for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have resided in South Australia six months. As to other qualifications, see Act 1148, 1913. Members of both houses are paid £200 per annum.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; 8 Districts returning 3 members each, and 11 Districts returning 2 members each. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have lived in South Australia for six months. The total number of electors in 1915 for the Legislative Council was 98,327, of whom 24,385 were females, and 73,942 males, and for the House of Assembly 254,940, of which 127,373 were females, and 127,567 males. The session is usually from June to December.

The franchise for both Houses was extended to adult women by Act 613 of 1894.

Responsible government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature, who form the Cabinet, and are ex-officio members of the Executive Council.

Local Government.

There are 34 municipalities in the State, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1890." The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen (Aldermen are at present elected for City of Adelaide and some of the Suburban Corporations only), and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditors. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by six ratepayers. There are also 149 district councils having somewhat similar powers. The aggregate assessment of the property within the municipal areas and District Councils amounts to 4,331,928l., and the revenue in 1914 amounted to 458,44 l., and the expenditure to 462,610l. In addition, the receipts for main roads amounted to 143,815l., and the expenditure to 132,415l.

Population.

The population of the State (including the northern territory) at the census of 1901, was 362,604 persons, and of 1911, 411,647. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are about 3,000. In 1911 there were about 1,586 Chinese in the State, of whom 1,331 were residents of the Northern Territory. The immigration of Chinese is controlled by the Commonwealth Government under the Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901. The population of the State on 30th June, 1916, was estimated to be 433,663.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide, including the suburbs, on 3rd April, 1911 (census), were 192,294. On 31st December, 1915, they numbered 214,443.

About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 28 per cent.

Education.

The University of Adelaide was founded by Royal Letters Patent in 1881, and an Act of the local Parliament in 1874. It was endowed by private munificence, aided by an annual grant of 5 per cent. on all sums contributed from private sources, and an endowment of land, the total amount of income for 1915 being 26,670l. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and music; the staff consists of 11 professors, 71 lecturers and assistants and 13 teachers in the Conservatorium of Music. All classes are open to women. It had in 1915 338 undergraduates and 318 non-graduating students (exclusive of 281 students at the Conservatorium of Music), besides those attending extension lectures. Total expenditure, 25,693l.

In connection with the Art Gallery 2 Schools of Design have been formed, in which 555 students are instructed in painting and designing for technical purposes.

The School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889. It is supported by an annual parliamentary vote of about 7,000l. and by school fees. Diplomas are awarded in mining, metallurgy, and mechanical engineering. The staff consists of about 70 officers and teachers. The students number 2,376. In addition, 350 children from public schools received instruction in domestic economy. There are in addition five Schools of Mines in the country at Gawler, Moonta, Kapunda, Port Pirie and Mount Gambier.

Primary education is provided for by the Education Acts of 1876, 1878, 1879, 1891, 1905, and 1915, by which the management of public education is committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free from January 1, 1892, up to the compulsory standard, and it has been compulsory since 1876. In 1915 there were 849 schools, with 1,974 teachers, and 62,600 scholars.

The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, etc., buildings, were during 1915, 349,044l. The total expenditure from loan money on school buildings up to December 31, 1915, was 732,680l.
Towards the maintenance of the South Australian Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, also country institutes the sum of about £20,000 is annually granted by the Government.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the State consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court; Local Courts of Insolvency at Port Augusta, Gladstone, Mount Gambier, and Moonta, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction in all the principal towns throughout the State with full jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates, and Limited Jurisdiction, by Justices of the Peace; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

The number of persons convicted in the Supreme Court averages nearly 90, approximately one in every 5,000 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in an easy and cheap manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

Eight banking institutions in addition to the Commonwealth Government Bank carry on business within the State, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 270 branches and agencies. Their names are: The Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Limited; National Bank of Australasia, Limited; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Limited; Bank of Adelaide; Bank of New South Wales; Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited; and London Bank of Australia, Limited. The total average liabilities of the nine banks amount to (June, 1916) £14,245,284, and the total average assets to £15,720,177.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 29 branches and 277 agencies. The number of depositors on 30th June, 1916, was 238,271 and the total deposits amounted to £9,284,790. Rate interest paid to depositors, 3½ per cent. The Commonwealth Savings Bank had 18,669 depositors and 727,348 deposits at the same date. Nearly 70 in every 100 persons of the population are depositors in savings banks, the deposits averaging about 2½ per head of population.

Penny Banks.

Agencies at schools, 483; depositors, 22,368; deposits, 17,899.

Industry.

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 150,000 square miles of the area of the State, are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 300 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,200 miles. Forty-eight counties have been proclaimed to 31st December, 1915, embracing 84,103 square miles, or 53,825,920 acres. The area outside the declared counties covers 295,957 square miles, or 189,418,880 acres. Of the area of the State only 13,743,860 acres have been or are being alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to about 90 acres for each male adult in the State about 115,000,000 acres being held under lease from the Crown. 2,943,395 acres are in process of alienation under systems of deferred payments. About two in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to leasing, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 20,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, etc.

About two-thirds the total area of land cultivated is cropped with wheat (for grain, hay and fodder), of which 3,220,645 acres were cultivated in 1915. The total area under cultivation was 5,346,646 acres. The following were the main crops grown in 1915-16: Wheat, 34,134,504 bushels; oats, 2,134,374 bushels; barley, 1,697,670 bushels; hay, 1,100,127 tons; and the estimated value of the crops was £12,833,147, or 29½ s. 8½ d. per head of population. The value of breadstuffs exported to overseas countries averages about £3,000,000 annually.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry; 27,764 acres of land were devoted to this purpose in 1915. Wine made, 3,700,878 gals. Exported overseas, 380,719 gals. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants; of the former 58,929 cwt., and of the latter, 66,518 cwt., were made in 1915. In 1915, 409,178 lbs. raisins and 171,460 lbs. currants were sent to overseas countries.

Almond trees (261,434) are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment. Apple trees, 1,061,753; apricot trees, 263,180; orange trees, 330,186; lemon trees, 38,354; pears, 205,440; plums, 180,936; peaches and nectarines, 283,013; cherries, 87,182; and also figs, quinces, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries, walnuts, peanuts, etc. The principal kinds of fruits produced last season were as follows:—Apples, 832,872 cases, of which 119,610 cases were exported; apricots, 159,077 cases; pears, 118,268 cases; and plums, 114,014 cases. The dried fruit production was as follows: Apricots, 3,939 cwt.; apples, 2,362 cwt.; peaches, 1,844 cwt.; and plums, 2,106 cwt.
The State possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive, 26,964 gallons of oil being expressed during 1913. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and superiority general over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market.

Potatoes, onions, turnips, carrots, mangolds, pumpkins and melons, tomatoes, and practically all kinds of vegetables grow well in the State, their production in 1915 being valued at £240,995.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1915 there were 150,580 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 253,333; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 226,565; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to 3,674,547, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 93,029 bales. Last year there were made 6,317,613 lbs. of butter, and 1,412,692 lbs. of cheese; and 2,432,485 lbs. of bacon and hams were cured. In normal seasons, large quantities of butter, frozen meat, etc., are exported to Europe, in addition to tallow and skins and hides.

The number of manufactories is 1,266, employing 25,496 hands and 42,164 horse-power actually used. Wages paid £2,705,130. Total value production £13,994,222.

Value of land, buildings, plant and machinery, £6,494,322.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, breweries, etc. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

The gasworks of the State are nine in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, one is at Glenelg, and the remaining six are in the principal country towns. There are also six electric supply companies.

The output of the electric and gas light and power establishments has increased from £237,374 to £358,275, or by 50 per cent. during the last five years.

284 vessels, of 69,161 tons, in 1915, belonged to Port Adelaide.

Out of £6,135,650 worth of produce exported overseas the value of breadstuffs amounted to £1,771,838.; while wool represented £1,412,104.; fruit and wine, £87,310.; meats, tallow, etc., £65,850.; concentrates and ores, £1,302,393.; lead, pig, £714,014.; bullion and specie, £294,455.; skins and hides, £172,778.; animals, living, £31,068.; leather, £52,434.; manures, £40,585.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, tea, coals, hardware, and machinery, manures, oils, timber and vehicles. The total external trade is £11,277,840., far the larger part of which is with the United Kingdom, the bulk of the remainder being with other British Countries, the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and Japan.

The chief copper mines are those at Moonta and Wallaroo; the chief gold fields, Arltunga, Angipena, Barossa, Blumberg, Echunga, Luxemburg, Mount Grainger, Mount Pleasant, Mount Torrens, Nillinghoo, Tarcoola, Teetupa, Ulooloo, Wadnaminga, Woodside, and Waukaringa, and Burrundie MacDonnell Ranges in the N.T. The minerals produced during the year 1915 were valued at £1,901,885., the chief being copper £561,247., gold £25,830., salt £90,000., and ironstone flux £264,612.

The output of the smelting works has increased by 125 per cent. during the last five years, viz., from £1,631,497. to £3,701,688., and our lime, cement and cement pipe establishments by 154 per cent., from £45,466. to £115,680.

Means of Communication.

There are 36,124 miles of roads defined in the settled districts, the greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 8,438. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railways are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the State is 2,187, exclusive of the Port Augusta Oodnadatta railway, 478 miles, and the East West railway, which are controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Up to June 30th, 1916, the cost of construction and equipment reached £17,616,351. The receipts in 1915-16 were £1,965,410., and the expenditure £1,545,489. Working expenses average 60 per cent. of the gross revenue. Net revenue on cost, averages over 5 per cent. There is daily railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph, some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over £500,000., across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party. An additional wire has been erected at a cost of over £50,000. At present the railway reaches Oodnadatta, 688 miles north of Adelaide, and Pine Creek, 146 miles south of Palmerston, the intervening gap being 1,200 miles.

At the close of the year 1914 there were 445 telegraph stations, 5,829 miles of telegraph line, and 14,584 miles of wire open throughout the State. There are 571 miles of telephone line open, 115 exchanges, 8,979 connections, and 30,639 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegraph messages sent and received in 1914 was 1,689,947.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia as well as with Europe and San Francisco. The rates of postage are:—
