VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the River Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass' Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the State meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,974,581 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other States of the group, that it now contains 29 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The population on the 31st December, 1915, was 1,417,891 viz., 692,275 males and 725,626 females. These numbers give a proportion of 104·8 females to 100 males.

Immigration.

For several years past the Government has been endeavouring to attract immigrants from the United Kingdom and other countries, and has met with a considerable amount of success. Agriculturists, rural workers, and domestic servants are the class of immigrants principally required. Farm labourers from the United Kingdom are charged £8 and domestic servants £5 for third-class passages from London to Melbourne. Inexperienced farm labourers obtain passages at a fare of £10. Other immigrants may obtain these passages for £12 to £14. Persons in Victoria may nominate friends and relations in Great Britain by lodging a deposit of £6, the balance of £6 or £8 being payable in monthly instalments extending over twelve months. After the immigrant has satisfied the Minister that he or she is a permanent resident of the State a rebate may be made which will make the portion of the fare payable by the nominator £10. Where the nominees are the wife and child of the nominator a rebate may be made which will make the net fare for adult males £8, adult females £4, and children £2.
Upon the outbreak of war in August, 1914, instructions were issued by the Victorian Government to its representatives in England that no men should be accepted for assisted passages who were within the limits of the recruiting ages.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number 1,816. The postal, telegraph and telephone revenue was £2,290,891., in 1915, and the expenditure £1,206,202.

There are 7,998 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 26,146 miles of wire; also about 208,444 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1914 was 3,267,196. There are 44,506 telephones in use in the State, with 34,071 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1915 was £494,287.

The railways in Victoria are all owned by the Government. The number of miles open for traffic on 30th June, 1916, was 4,105, and 1384 miles were in course of construction. The receipts in 1915-16 totalled £5,730,743., and the working expenses £4,141,588. (including £121,332. pensions and gratuities). The total cost of construction of lines opened to 30th June, 1915, was £4,560,106. The interest and expenses on the debt incurred for construction amounted to £1,927,107. during the year, and the revenue deficiency for the twelve months was £337,952. The percentage of net receipts to capital cost was 2.91.

Climate.

From its geographical position Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other State of Australia. In regard to heat the weather is never severely oppressive, except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57°4'; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91°3 feet above the sea level was 29°53 inches; rain falls on the average upon 135 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25°27 inches.

Early History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonisation, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 6th January, 1802, by Acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year an attempt was made to colonise the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Port Phillip Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the (as yet) unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839.
having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when, on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 7,069,608 acres being under cultivation in 1915-16. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 3,679,971 acres, producing 58,521,706 bushels; oats, 353,932 acres, producing 9,328,894 bushels; barley, 61,400 acres, producing 1,734,511 bushels; potatoes, 56,910 acres, producing 173,821 tons; and hay, 1,330,455 acres, producing 2,342,094 tons. About 22,353 acres were devoted to the culture of the vine, producing 1,380,387 gallons of wine, 180,104 cwts. of raisins, and 70,556 cwts. of currants. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides; in 1915 there were produced 42,345,113 lbs. of butter (of which 11,417,311 lbs. were exported overseas) and 3,497,278 lbs. of cheese. In March, 1916, there were in the State 493,779 horses, 1,043,604 cattle (including 451,088 milch cows), 10,545,632 sheep, and 192,002 pigs. The wool exported overseas in 1915 amounted to 100,526,942 lbs., valued at £6,203,565. The amount of gold raised in 1915 was 352,272 ozs., making a total since 1851 of 74,310,887 ozs., valued at £26,703,967. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the State will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of coal raised in 1915 was 588,104 tons, valued at £274,770. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise nearly half of the total), are grain and flour, butter, hides and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea, and iron. Melbourne does 87 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wodonga, Wahgunyah, Yarrawonga, Gooramadda, Koondrook, Tocumwal, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1915 numbered 427, with a total tonnage of 165,717.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on thereat; were this done, the manufactories of the State might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. The following is a statement of the number and nature of manufactories and hands employed therein during 1915:

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other States. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. By the Water Act of 1905 all existing irrigation trusts, with the exception of the First Mildura Irrigation Trust, were abolished, and their works and duties transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. In 1909 an Act was passed extending the authority of this latter body by giving it the general construction of works formerly intrusted to the Department of Water Supply and by imposing on the Commission all the duties formerly performed by the Water Supply Department. The capital expenditure on the irrigation works controlled by the Commissioners on the 30th June, 1915, amounted to £3,450,155. The Commission is empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation under their jurisdiction, the total area irrigated being 288,000 acres. The Mildura Irrigation Colony, lands, works, and approaches are controlled by the First Mildura Irrigation Trust. From time to time the Government has assisted the Mildura Trust until on the 30th June, 1915, the total amount advanced was £7,232., which, together with interest accumulated to that date represents its total indebtedness to the Government. The area of land irrigated by this Trust in 1914-15 was 12,822 acres.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, on the 31st December, 1915, had a population of 684,000. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (42,252), Bendigo (37,660), Geelong (35,285), Warrnambool (7,300), Castlemaine (7,387), Maryborough (5,100), Hamilton (5,000), Mildura (4,800), and Stawell (4,500).

Coloured Immigrants.

With a view of restricting the immigration of Asiatics and other coloured persons, the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Immigration Restriction Act in 1901, which provides that any person, who, when asked to do so by a public officer, fails to write out from dictation and sign in the presence of the officer, a passage of fifty words in any prescribed language, is prohibited from landing in Australia. Certificates of exemption are granted in certain cases, and members of the military and naval forces, as well as the master and crew of any public vessel of any government, are excepted. There are not more than 7,184 coloured persons in the State.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 694 in all, throughout the State during the December quarter of 1915:—The Bank of Australasia; of New South Wales; of New Zealand; of Victoria; Colonial of Australasia; Commercial of Australia; English, Scottish and Australian; London of Australia; National of Australasia; Royal of Australia; the Union of Australia; Queensland National; North Queensland; Ballarat Banking Co.; Comptoir National D'Escompte de Paris; and Commonwealth.

The deposits at that period amounted to £54,040,102., and the paid up capital to £25,112,160l.

There are also 123 banks and branches, with 322 agencies at Post Offices of the Savings Bank. The number of depositors on the 30th June, 1916, was 746,597, and the amount on deposit was £26,389,993. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of about £4,000,000. is coined annually.

Education.

Education establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary and secondary education; registered schools for primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognised in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Methodist Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1915 was 1,351. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1915, the total number of students who matriculated was 7,929, and 5,557 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, number 22, of which 7 afford instruction in science, art, commercial and trade subjects; 8 in art, trade, and science; 2 in art, commercial, and trade; 1 in science, commercial, and art; 1 in art and commerce; while 3 schools confine their teaching to art subjects; there are also 2 Agricultural Colleges and 1 School of Horticulture.
principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes and open to women as well as men. The gross enrolment of pupils, excluding those at agricultural and horticultural colleges, was 6,842.

The system of primary public instruction, which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, and State instruction is granted free of cost. In 1914-15 there were 2,227 State schools, with a total enrolment of 250,284 scholars, instructed by 6,512 teachers (including 427 temporary teachers). The average attendance was 160,885. In 1914-15 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was 1,054,854l. There is no local control over the schools.

The secondary schools are for the most part under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1914-15, there were 509 registered schools in Victoria, with 1,879 teachers, and an attendance of 62,638 scholars. Of these the Roman Catholic denomination had about one-fourth, about one-third of the teachers, and over half the scholars.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is the official head of the Legislature, and assents in the name of the Crown to Acts passed by the Parliament. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 34 members elected for 17 Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 65 members returned by 65 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

The constitution of the two Houses and the qualification of Members and Electors have been amended on several occasions, and a Reform Act received the Royal Assent on 26th November, 1903. By this Act the number of Members of both Houses was reduced, the franchise for the Upper House broadened, and the property qualification for membership reduced, and several other reforms made. In 1907 an Act was assented to abolishing the separate representation of railways and public officers in the Parliament of the State—one of the provisions of the Reform Act of 1903. Officers in the service of the Government are, however, forbidden to take any part in the political affairs of the State otherwise than by recording a vote, and are prohibited from using any influence in respect to any matter affecting their remuneration or position in the public service.

The Adult Suffrage Act of 1908, assented to on 31st March, 1909, places women on an equality with men as electors for the State Legislature.

One of the two Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every three years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council, except in case of a deadlock between the two Houses. The property qualification of members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 50l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 15l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, matriculated students of the University of Melbourne, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-masters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered. By the Reform Act of 1903 the Council is now empowered to suggest alterations in these Bills.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and universal suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1899, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is, under ordinary circumstances, three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1836, and by an Act passed in October, 1900, provision is made for voting by post in certain cases.

All members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

An Act was passed in December, 1903, limiting the amount which may be expended by candidates for election expenses to 400l. and 150l., for the Council and the Assembly respectively. The purposes for which such expenditure may be incurred are also defined.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,234 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the State. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality, except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1915-16 there were 52 cities, towns, and boroughs and 141 shires. The number of ratepayers was 393,133; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 16,942,062l., representing a value in fee simple of 318,960,116l.; the total income in 1915 was 2,205,472l., and the expenditure was 2,237,663l.; whilst their loan indebtedness amounted to 5,739,084l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1915 was 310,498l., and its expenditure 284,168l., including capital expenditure 266,907l. The outstanding debt of the Trust at the end of 1915 amounted to 1,850,000l.
The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1914-15 the Board's ordinary revenue was £729,000., and its expenditure £63,994., exclusive of £454,890. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1915, amounting to £11,984,946., of which, however, £1,559,786. was raised in the first instance by the general Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works completed and in course of construction amounted to £7,272,283. up to the 30th June, 1915.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities and the Insurance Companies. In 1915 their revenue amounted to £110,458., their ordinary expenditure to £35,097., including £8,808. loan expenditure, and their debt to £200,000.

The Melbourne tramways were constructed by a Trust at a cost of £1,705,794., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. The debt was gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a public company, to which the lines were let for a period of 30 years. The lease expired on 1st July, 1916, when the balance of the outstanding debentures (£450,000.) was paid off. A Board consisting of five members, was nominated by the Government to take over and operate the undertaking from 1st July, 1916, to 31st October, 1917, or such earlier date as may be proclaimed by the Governor-in-Council. The Board is authorized to borrow up to £500,000. in order to finance the amount required to purchase such property of the Melbourne Tramway Company as may be necessary to carry on the undertaking. The amount of the compensation to be paid to the Company is to be fixed by arbitration.
