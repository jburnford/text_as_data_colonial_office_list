WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 51' E.

Coast Line.

The Southern and Western coast line is, to a great extent, of a flat and sandy character, with comparatively few natural harbours or other indentations, until the Kimberley Division is reached, where its character changes, and it becomes bold and broken, and fringed with numerous islands. The total length of the coast line, not including minor features, is estimated to be approximately 4,350 miles.

Bays, Gulfs, &c.

The principal inlets, beginning from the north, are: Cambridge Gulf, Napier Broome Bay, Vansittart Bay, Admiralty Gulf, Montague Sound, York Sound, Brunswick Bay, Camden Sound, Collier Bay, King Sound, Beagle Bay, Roe buck Bay, Lagrange Bay, Port Walcott, Nickol Bay, Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, Champion Bay, Cockburn Sound, Koombana Bay, Geographe Bay, Flinders Bay, King George Sound, Bremer Bay, and Esperance Bay. With the exception of Princess Royal Harbour (the inner harbour of King George Sound), the principal anchorages used to the south of the 19th parallel of latitude are open roadsteads, which, as a rule, are only partially protected; but the holding grounds of these are fairly good, and accidents seldom happen to vessels properly found. Fine harbours have, however, been artificially provided at Fremantle, at the mouth of the Swan River, and at Bunbury, in Koombana Bay.

Capes.

The principal capes are: Capes Domett and Dussejour at the entrance of Cambridge Gulf; Cape Londonderry, which is the most northerly point of the State, with Cape Talbot, on the same peninsula; Cape Bougainville, lying between Admiralty Gulf and Vansittart Bay; Cape Voltaire, which is the western boundary of Admiralty Gulf; Cape Torrens, at the entrance to York Sound; Cape Lévêque, the western boundary of King Sound; Cape Bruguières, to the west of Nickol Bay; North-West Cape, which forms the western boundary of Exmouth Gulf; Cape Cuvier, at the northern extremity of Shark Bay; Cape Inscription, at the north end of Dirk Hartogs Island, so named because of an inscription plate placed there by Dirk Hartogs in 1616; Steep Point, situated on the southern entrance to Shark Bay, which is the most westerly point of the Continent; Cape Vlaming, being the Western extremity of Rottnest Island; Capes Naturaliste and Leeuwin at the south-western extremity of the Continent, and Point D'Entrecasteaux, West Cape Howe, Bald Head, Cape Riche, Hood Point, Cape le Grande, and Cape Arid on the Southern coast.

Tides.

As would naturally be expected with so extensive a coast line, the tides are very varied, little or no rise and fall being experienced on the South and South-Western coasts, whilst from Shark Bay northwards they increase rapidly, though not uniformly in range, attaining at King Sound a height of 46 feet.

Islands.

The islands which occur on the coast are, as a rule, small and unimportant, those best known being Garden and Rottnest Islands off Fremantle; the Houman Abrolhos, near Champion Bay, on which guano is found; Dirk Hartogs and other islands in Shark Bay, used for pastoral purposes; Dampier Archipelago and the Montebello Group on the North-West coast; and off the Kimberley or extreme Northern coast, the Lace pedes, on which are guano deposits and the Buccaneer and Bonaparte Archipelagos, for the most part unexplored.

Rivers.

The principal rivers are: in the North, the Ord, with its tributaries, the Denham, Bow, Negri, and Panton; the Pentecost, with its tributary, the Chamberlain; the Durack, Drysdale, King Edward, Prince Regent, Charnley, Isdell, and the Fitzroy, with its tributaries the Margaret and Hann Rivers and Christmas Creek. In the North-West the De Grey, with its tributaries, the Oakover, Shaw, and Strelley; the Yule, the Fortescue, and the Ashburton, with its tributaries, the Henry and Hardy. Then, falling to the Western Coast, the Minalya, the Gascoyne, with its tributary, the Lyons; the Woorangal, the Murchison, with its tributary, the Sanford; the Greenough; the Swan, on which is situated the capital of the State, and which, inland, is called the Avon; the Murray, the Collie, and the Preston. And lastly, on the Southern Coast, the Blackwood, Donnelly, Warren, Frankland, Kalgan, Pallinup, Gairdner, Fitz Gerald and Phillips Rivers.

Mountains.

In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the King Leopold and the Princess May ranges, the highest point in the latter, Mount Hann, attaining 2,800 feet. In the North-West, between the Fortescue and Ashburton Rivers, the highest range is the Hamersley, with Mount Bruce (4,024 feet). The Darling range, which extends from Yatheroo in the North to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles, attains its highest elevation, 1,910 feet above the level of the sea, at Mount Cooke in the Cockburn Sound District. In the South, the loftiest range is the Stirling range, the highest point of which is Bluff Knoll (3,640 feet). Between it and the coast, and parallel with both, extends the less elevated Porongorup range.

Lakes.

There are no lakes of any considerable importance in the State. Between the Darling range and the coast there are a few salt water lagoons, and many fresh water lakes, the majority of which are nothing more than swamps during the dry season, and none of them are of any economic importance. The so-called lakes in the interior of the State, which are frequently of very considerable area, are, except after the occasional heavy rains, merely immense salt marshes or clay-pans.

Contour of the Country.

That part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as mountainous, consisting of alternating high and lower lying plateaux; the highest country here is
principally of sandstone formation. The North-West Division and much of the Gascoyne Division is a distinctly mountainous country; the ranges here being principally granite. The north and north-eastern parts of the State contain a large area of good pastoral country. A large proportion of the South-Western and Southern sea-boards is of flat, sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation, and may be described as a vast forest, principally timbered with jarrah, white and red gums, and karri, most of which timbers are of great commercial value. From some points on the Western sea-board settlement has extended for about 500 miles inland; but, from very complete information furnished by explorers and prospectors, it is apparent that no considerable portion of the interior lying between the 19th and 31st parallels of latitude, and between the 121st and 129th meridians of longitude is suitable for any class of settlement except in connection with the development of the mineral resources. This area may be described as a great tableland, with an altitude of from one to two thousand feet above sea level, the surface of which consists largely of sand dunes, though in many parts of it there are large areas of clayey soils. Between the 30th parallel of latitude and the Great Australian Bight, much of the country is of limestone formation, and here there are immense areas of grass land, which only await the discovery of subterranean water to make them amongst the most productive areas of the State.

Early History.

The first authentic record of European explorers visiting any portion of Western Australia is contained in the words cut into the tin plate, now in the State Museum at Amsterdam, which was nailed on the 25th October, 1616, by Dirk Hartog, the commander of the Dutch vessel Eendracht, to a post erected on Point Inscription on what is now called Dirk Hartog Island. Other vessels successively visited, or were driven by stress of weather on the West coast of the Continent, notably the Leeuwin in 1622, the Batavia (Capt. Pelsart) in 1628, the Lijmmen (Capt. Tasman) in 1644, and the Geelvinck (Capt. de Vlaming) in 1696. The first Englishman, however, to land on these coasts was William Dampier, who, in 1688, in the Ogynt, landed at King Sound. French navigators followed during the next century and after, viz., de St. Alouarn in Le Gros Ventre, in 1772, d'Entrecasteaux, in La Recherche, in 1792, Baudin, in the Geographie, in 1801, de Freycinet, in the Uranie, in 1818, and De Bougainville, with the vessels Thetis and Esperance, in 1825. In 1791, Vancouver, in the Discovery, took formal possession of the country about King George Sound. In 1801, Matthew Flinders, in the Investigator, explored the Southern coast of the Continent, which, at his suggestion, subsequently received the name of Australia; whilst from 1818 to 1822 Philip Parker King, first in the Mermaid and afterwards in the Bathurst, explored and carefully charted its Northern Coasts.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent 20 convicts and a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound and formed a settlement then called Fredericks Town. In 1827 Captain James (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, in H.M.S. Success, surveyed the coast from King George Sound to the Swan River, and in May, 1829, Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. Challenger, took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain Stirling founded the Swan River Settlement, now the Commonwealth State of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success, until, in 1850, the State was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants' petition that it might be made a penal settlement was acceded to. Between 1850 and 1868, when transportation ceased, 9,718 convicts were sent out. The Imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

In 1870 the constitution, which was what is called "Representative," was established by Act 33 Vict., No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council, consisting then of three official members of the Executive Council, three unofficial nominees of the Governor, and 12 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The Legislature consists of two Houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 30 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 50 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.

Provinces.—The State is divided into 10 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Any man who is (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the State for at least 2 years; (3) a natural-born subject of His Majesty or naturalised for 5 years, and a resident in the State during that period.

Qualification of Elector.—"The Constitution Act Amendment Act, 1899," has extended the right to vote equally to both sexes. The qualifications of a voter are laid down in the Act, which extends the franchise to every person, not under 21 years of age, and not otherwise disqualified, who (1) is a subject of the King, either natural born or having been naturalised for at least 12 months; (2) has resided in the State for 6 months; and (3) in the province for which enrolment is claimed has freehold property of the clear value of £50, or is a householder or a ratepayer in respect of property of the clear annual value of £17, or a leaseholder to the clear annual value of £17, or a Crown leaseholder paying a rental of £10 per annum.

Legislative Assembly.

Districts.—There are 50 electoral districts for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by one member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 3 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the State for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the King, or shall have been naturalised for 5 years, and shall have resided in the State for 2 years.
Qualifications of Electors.—Subject to certain qualifications every person not under twenty-one years of age, who—

(a) is a natural born or naturalised subject of His Majesty; and

(b) has resided in Western Australia for six months continuously; and

(c) has resided in the district for which he claims to be enrolled for a continuous period of one month immediately preceding the date of his claim,

is entitled to be enrolled as an elector, and when enrolled, and so long as he continues to reside in the district for which he is enrolled, to vote at the election of a member of the Legislative Assembly for that district. No person can be a registered voter in more than one electorate.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible Ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Premier and Colonial Treasurer; the Minister for Lands and Agriculture; the Minister for Railways, Water Supply, and Industries; the Colonial Secretary and Minister for Education; the Minister for Works and Trading Concerns; the Attorney-General and Minister for Mines; and two Ministers without portfolio.

Western Australia is represented in the Federal Senate of Australia by six members, and in the House of Representatives by five members.

Local Government.

Under the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1906," municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding 1s. 6d. in the £ per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property. All license fees, tolls, dues, &c., under the Municipal Corporations Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. Under the "Roads Act, 1911," Boards are allowed to levy a general rate as follows:—Upon the unimproved rateable value of land not less than 1d. or exceeding 3d. in the £, and upon the annual value not less than 9d. or exceeding 2s. in the £. Municipalities and Road Boards have power to borrow money for the construction of roads and other purposes. Both may levy "loan rates" for interest and Sinking Fund in connection with loans; for the former the rate must not exceed 1s. 6d. in the £, but for the latter no maximum has been fixed. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Boulder, Broome, Bunbury, Busselton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Collie, Coolgardie, Cottesloe, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Guildford, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Leonora, Midland Junction, Mt. Magnet, Narrogin, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, Greater Perth, South Perth, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Victoria Park, Wagin, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a mayor and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and 12 councillors—the mayor being elected annually by the ratepayers, by whom also the councillors are elected for a term of three years. Local road boards and municipal councils have power under Acts of Parliament to issue licenses to carts, carriages, etc., within their respective districts and municipalities.

33,646£ was granted for the financial year 1915-16 to District Road Boards (of which there were, on the 30th June, 1916, 117) and Municipal Councils (30) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the State, in addition to the moneys expended by the Public Works Department for the same purpose. Under the "Water Boards Act, 1904," Boards may levy a rate not exceeding 2s. 6d. in the £ on the annual rateable value of land, and have power to borrow money for the construction of works, etc. Under the Health Act, 1911, the Local Boards of Health of municipalities and other localities to which the provisions of the Act apply are required to make and levy such annual health rate as may be required for the purposes of that Act.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the State at the 31st July, 1916, was estimated to be 314,740, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese at the 1911 census was 1,812, of whom 1,775 were males and only 37 females. In addition to these there were 33 male and 27 female half-caste Chinese.

The chief towns are Perth (at the time of the 1911 census, 106,792, including the municipality of Fremantle, 14,499, and the various suburbs within the Metropolitan Area), and the following municipalities:—Albany (3,586), Boulder (10,824), Bunbury (3,763), Collie (1,731), Coolgardie (2,000), Geraldton (3,478), Kalgoorlie (8,781), Leonora (1,616), Northam (3,361), Wagin (1,000), York (1,535), and Broome, with a considerable floating population of pearlers, mostly Asiatics.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the State, 22,100,437 acres only were, on the 31st December, 1915, alienated or in process of alienation, while 192,312,888 acres were leased, viz., 188,384,063 for pastoral, and the balance for other purposes. No less than 410,175,475 acres were still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 4,350 miles, not including minor features, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. The south-west corner of the State, however, where the older settlements are situated, has now proved itself destined to become one of the world's greatest wheat producing areas, and agriculture here is progressing at an almost phenomenal rate, the wheat harvest having increased from 2,460,823 bushels in 1909, to 18,236,355 bushels in 1916. As a rule, a sufficient rainfall can be relied upon. In the neighbourhood of Toodyay, Northam, York, Beverley, Pingelly, Wagin, Katanning, and the other centres of the southern part of the State, the areas under farms and cultivation are constantly and rapidly extending, and of late wheat growing has been very successful a long way east of these places. The total area of land under cultivation on 28th Feb., 1916, was 8,056,962 acres, viz., under crop 2,190,034 acres, under permanent artificially sown grasses 8,119 acres, new ground cleared during the season and prepared for next season's crops 293,625 acres, land in fallow 686,421 acres, area of other cleared land, previously cropped, now used for grazing or lying idle 1,069,171 acres, ring-barked or partially cleared...
land 3,819,582 acres; beyond this, the travellers, way still lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialised in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian States, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 4,803,850) are depastured in all parts of the State. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in the year ended 30th June, 1916, principally to London, was 28,868,646 lbs. greasy, valued at 1,258,577l., and 234,808 lbs. scoured and washed, valued at 14,606l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made. Since 1907, wheat growing has become a specially important industry. In that year, the export of wheat was valued at 96,875l., that of flour at 34,565l. In 1910 the figures were respectively 406,326l. and 25,427l., in 1911, 336,922l. and 54,665l., in 1912, 100,148l. and 121,730l., in 1913, 763,798l. and 239,840l., whilst for the first six months of 1914 the values amounted to 1,343,856l. and 158,011l.; for the year ended 30th June, 1915, to 10l. and 26,630l.; and for the year ended 30th June, 1916, to 1,023,362l. and 214,164l. The season 1914-15 was an exceptionally dry one, and, in addition, war conditions have, of late, had an influence on the export. Another progressive industry is fruit-growing, especially apples, which latter are already exported in considerable quantities. The export of fruit rose in value from 925l. in 1907 to 32,274l. in 1913, to 68,280l. during the first six months of 1914, to 46,417l. during the year ended 30th June, 1915, and to 22,215l. during the year ended 30th June, 1916.

The principal forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, harbour works, etc. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government and also by the Government. The export of timber for the six months ended 30th June, 1914 was valued at 502,053l. The figures for the two subsequent years, 1914-15 and 1915-16, were respectively 808,392l. and 442,014l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Asiatic countries to the value of 61,881l. during 1915-16.

At Broome and on the north-west coast generally, a fleet of some 218 schooners, cutters, and luggers are employed on the pearling banks, giving occupation to 97 white, 30 aboriginal, and 1,440 Asiatic pearlers. The export of pearl shell amounted to 158,597l. in 1915-16, when no pearls were exported.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but of late years little work has been done in them. Copper, however, has since been found also in several other districts, notably those of Mt. Morgans, Phillips River, and West Pilbara.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until comparatively recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners to Western Australia, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

After the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining became for the time being the principal industry of the State, and so rapidly did the annual output of gold increase for a number of years, that it placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing States of Australasia.

There are now 18 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, and Phillips River, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields have for several years been well established, with a steady annual output and a settled population. The value of gold produced up to the end of July, 1916, was 127,881,864l. In the first seven months of 1916 the value of the gold production was 2,623,710l.

There is also good coal in the south-west corner of the State, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, six companies are successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1915-16 was 289,296 tons.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered at Greenbushes, on the Blackwood river, resulting in the opening up of a rich tinfield. Considerable quantities of tin have also been raised at Marble Bar.

Silver is found, mostly together with other minerals, and extracted in conjunction with gold. Other minerals found are antimony, godolinite, bismuth, tantalite, lead, asbestos, mica, wolfram and scheelite, zinc, ironstone, magnesite, limestone and pyritic ore.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the State: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and the Royal Bank of Australia, Limited, which commenced business in 1915.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1915, averaged 7,614,731l.

The Commonwealth Bank of Australia commenced business in Western Australia on 20th January, 1913. The average deposits for the year 1915 included above amounted to 1,620,727l., including Commonwealth Savings Bank Deposits.

The Government savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1916, amounted to 3,640,874l., exclusive of amounts deposited in the School Savings Bank, viz., 13,965l.

Branches of the Commonwealth Savings Bank were opened in this State at the beginning of 1913, and the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1916, amounted to 762,943l.
A branch of the Royal Mint exists in Perth. Expressed in ozs. of fine gold, the quantities received amounted in 1915 to 1,192,771 ozs. The total amount of fine gold received to the 31st December of the latter year was 18,601,622 ozs.

Education.

Government Primary Schools exist in all parts of the State, and are under the control of the Minister for Education. The whole cost of the schools is borne by the Government, and the staffs are appointed by the Education Department.

Attendance at school of all children between the ages of six and fourteen is compulsory, and only in cases of poverty or sickness on the part of the parents is exemption granted to children between the ages of twelve and fourteen. General religious teaching, exclusive of dogmatic or polemic theology, is included in the course of instruction given, whilst representatives of various denominations are admitted to give instruction during school hours to their followers.

Boys over twelve and under fourteen years of age are trained as Junior Cadets in all schools.

The number of Government Primary Schools open in 1915 was 622. The average enrolment for the year was 46,268, and the average attendance 39,970.

Where an average attendance of ten children cannot be maintained, the Department pays an annual grant (from 7l. to 8l. 10s.) for each child if the parents secure a suitable teacher.

Children who complete satisfactorily the primary course may obtain the Department's "Qualifying Certificate." They may then pass to a High School for a four years' Secondary Course, or to the upper classes of a Central School for a two years' course.

Three courses—Commercial, Industrial, and Domestic—are provided in the upper classes of the Central Schools.

The four years' course in the Government High Schools is divided into two sections of two years each. The work of the lower section is, with very small exceptions, common to all students. In the upper section there is a considerable amount of specialisation.

Manual training in woodwork is included in the course of all the larger Primary Schools. In the Central Schools and High Schools metalwork is also taken.

Domestic work—Cookery, Laundry and Housewifery—is included in the course of all the larger Primary Schools, and also in the course of the Central Schools and High Schools.

Continuation Classes are provided for those who leave school without passing through the upper classes of the Central Schools or the High Schools. The courses of these classes are designed to lead to higher work in the Technical Schools.

Technical Schools are established in the principal centres. They include advanced work in Science, Trades Classes, Commercial Classes, Art Classes, Domestic Classes, etc. There is also a large School of Mines at Kalgoorlie.

The University in Perth provides courses for Degrees in Arts, Science (including Agriculture), and Engineering.

Scholarships are provided by the Government to enable pupils from the Primary Schools to pass to the Secondary Schools. Further scholarships are provided to be held at the Technical Schools, and ten scholarships are offered each year for the University.

Education is free throughout from the Kindergarten to the University. Fees at the Government High School were abolished at the beginning of 1913, when the University opened without fees. Fees in the Technical Schools were abolished at the beginning of 1914.

Private Schools are open to Government inspection, and must be declared efficient. The Government Secondary School Scholarships may be held at non-Government Secondary Schools.

The total Government expenditure upon education during 1915-16 (apart from the University and the cost of buildings) was £317,656. The amount expended on buildings for the Education Department was £29,448. There was also a grant of £13,500. to the University. The aggregate expenditure upon Education was therefore £360,604. The mean population of the State for the financial year was 315,209.

Means of Communication.

The State possesses at present eight lines of Government railways as shown below. The first four form the Southern System, which is connected with the Northern System by No. 5. The Midland Railway Company's (Private) line of 277 miles, constructed on the land grant system, and running from Midland Junction to Walkaway, also affords a connection between the Southern and Northern Systems.

The Hopetoun to Ravensthorpe and Port Hedland to Marble Bar Railways are not geographically connected with the remainder of the system.

These lines have numerous sidings, totalling in all 344 miles.

The Government have taken over from the 1st July, 1913, the Perth Electric Tramways.

There are also several other private lines, mostly constructed by timber companies in the south of the State, in extent about 688 miles.

A scheme has for years been under consideration by the Commonwealth Government, and is now being carried out, for the connection, by a proposed Transcontinental Railway (4ft. 8½in. gauge) from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, of the railway systems of Western and South Australia, a distance of 1,063 miles.

The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1916, were 2,088,110£., and the working expenses 1,511,655£. The total cost of construction has been 17,118,195£.

Of electric telegraph on the 30th June, 1916, there were 15,449 miles of wire. During 1915 the revenue received by the telegraph branch was 85,019£.; telephone receipts amounted to 73,408£., and postal and other revenue of the post and telegraph department to 187,675£.; cost of post and telegraph, 490,717£. (incl. new works).

There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay, also with South Africa by Cocos Island.

Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the State, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 30,277 miles of telephone wire in the State; further 7,360 miles of Government, and 575 miles of private railway telephone wire, and 1,076 miles of Government railway telegraph wire.

A high-power wireless station has been erected at Applecross, between Perth and Fremantle, by the Commonwealth Government. Stations of lower power have been erected at Esperance, Geraldton, Roebourne, Broome and Wyndham.

The steamers of the P. and O. and Orient Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the other Australian States, which are further supplemented by those of the Messageries Maritimes, whilst the White Star line conveys those from and to South Africa at regular monthly intervals. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australian States, New Zealand, and Polynesia, by the various inter-State steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 28 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:—

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 381 vessels and a tonnage of 32,923 on 31st December, 1915. Harbour works have been constructed, and the Royal Mail steamers, as also those of the Messageries Maritimes, make Fremantle their port of call.

**Aborigines.**

The native population is not large*, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are occasionally employed as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule, they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (founded by the late Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the Houses of Legislature in 1897, but has since been repealed by the "Aborigines Act" of 1905 (amended, 1911). In accordance with the clauses of the latter the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of 10,000£. to be used by this sub-department. In addition to this sum, a further amount of 12,873£. was spent on behalf of the aborigines during the year ending 30th June, 1916.

**Climate.**

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate during 1915 was 9·28 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·18 inches (for 40 years), and the mean temperature is 64°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

**Governors of Western Australia.†**

Sir W. C. F. Robinson, G.C.M.G., 20th Oct., 1890.
Alexander Campbell Onslow, Administrator, 21st Sept., 1891.

* The number of full-blooded aborigines and half-castes, so far as enumerated, at the date of the 1911 census was 6,369, and 1,475 respectively. These include only those who were in the employ of whites at date of the census, or were living in a civilised or semi-civilised condition in the vicinity of settlements of whites at that date.
