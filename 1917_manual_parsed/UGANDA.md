UGANDA.

(For Map see East Africa.)

Extent and Boundaries.

The British Protectorate over Buganda was proclaimed on June 19th, 1894, in succession to a brief administration by the Imperial British East Africa Company. The Protectorate was further extended over Bunyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous subsequent treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Buganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth more or less as follows:

On the east by British East Africa as far north as the 4th degree of north latitude, the natural boundaries being Lake Rudolf, River Turkwel, Mount Elgon, and the Rio River running into the north-east corner of Lake Victoria; on the south, by the Anglo-German boundary and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the frontier of the Belgian Congo, the natural boundaries being Lake Edward, Mt. Ruwenzori, the Semliki River, Lake Albert and the Nile watershed; and on the north, by the Uganda-Sudan boundary.

The area of the Uganda Protectorate is estimated at 109,119 square miles, including 16,377 square miles of water. Pending the complete survey of the country, it is not possible to give the correct area.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate is divided into five provinces (Rudolf, Eastern, Northern, Western, and Buganda), and then again into numerous districts. The King or "Kabaka" of Buganda is accorded the title of "His Highness," and his position and rights are regulated by treaty.

Climate.

The climate, when compared with that of some tropical countries, is not unpleasant but it can by no means be called healthy. The conditions vary with the altitude in different parts of the Protectorate: the Nile Valley, which lies about 2,000 above sea-level, is hot, and is considerably more unhealthy than the higher-lying regions between Lakes Victoria and Albert. The most congenial climate for European residence is found...
in the Buganda kingdom and in the Western Province, where in some districts the altitude exceeds 5,000 feet above the sea-level. European children thrive well in infancy in a few of the healthier stations, but considerable risk is attached to bringing them out when over two or three years old, as they are always liable to attacks of malaria and the consequent anemia and general ill-health resulting therefrom. Residents in Entebbe keep fairly good health but even there malaria and blackwater fever are by no means unknown. Epidemics of plague and small-pox have occurred amongst the natives in recent years, but the medical authorities have fortunately been able to confine these outbreaks for the most part within narrow limits, owing to the co-operation of the chiefs in enforcing the restrictions and regulations imposed.

The climate is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the year 1915 at Entebbe being—Maximum, 79°6 Fahrenheit; minimum, 62°3 Fahrenheit. Average daily sunshine, 5 hours 24 minutes.

The average rainfall at 38 stations, for the year ending 31st December, 1915, was 49·73 inches. Highest rainfall was registered at Soroti, being 80·08 inches.

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February.

The healthiest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the least healthy, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to one immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes become more in evidence and malarial infections more numerous.

No part of the Uganda Protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Ankole in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria prevails at all seasons of the year.

Sleeping sickness has been the scourge of the country in the last few years, at least on the islands and along the shores of the great lakes and rivers; but now that the whole population has been removed from the neighbourhood of these, the disease is well under control, and should spread no further, in spite of the fact that no curative remedy is known and but little hope is entertained of one being found.

History.

During the first years of the British Protectorate an armed force was created from the remains of the Sudanese army of Emin Pasha. To these other recruits were added from the districts of the White Nile, and the force thus organised, together with irregular bands of friendly Baganda, was used to repel the hostile attacks of the King of Bunyoro, and later of Mwanga, King of Buganda. Later on an Indian contingent, similar to that employed in East Africa and in British Central Africa, was established. Unfortunately discontent arose amongst a section of the Sudanese force. These Sudanese broke into open mutiny at the end of 1897, and Mwanga, who had escaped to German territory, returned to Buganda and joined the mutineers and Kabarega, rebel King of Bunyoro, in December, 1897. The Baganda, however, remained loyal, and after a year's fighting, with some loss in British officers, the mutiny was thoroughly quelled, and Mwanga and Kabarega were captured, and sent as prisoners to Kisimayu. In 1901 (Mwanga died May 8th, 1903) they were transferred to Seychelles, where they and a number of followers are maintained at the expense of the Uganda Government. Since the early part of 1899 the country has been perfectly peaceful, and has made considerable progress in commerce.

Communications.

The Uganda Protectorate itself is separated by about 800 miles from the east coast of Africa, but the north-easternmost extremity of Victoria Lake is not distant more than 580 miles. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the British East Africa Protectorate, transport was formerly exceedingly difficult, owing to the paucity of inhabitants to act as porters, and stretches of country unhealthy for beasts of burden. Consequently the Imperial Government resolved in 1896 to construct a railway from Mombasa to the north-east corner of Lake Victoria. This railway, at the end of 1901, had reached and descended the Kikuyu escarpment, traversed the Great Rift Valley, ascended the slopes of the Mau range to within a short distance from the summit, descended thence the Nyando Valley, and finally covered the whole 584 miles separating Mombasa from Port Florence on Victoria Nyanza, which is the terminus of the railway. Thus the line, though called the Uganda Railway, actually lies entirely in the East Africa Protectorate. The gross expenditure to 31st March, 1903, was £5,384,370l. (about 9,500/- per mile). Uganda is now in telegraphic communication with Mombasa by a land line, and thence by cable with Great Britain and other countries. All important centres within the Protectorate are now connected by telegraph with the exception of those in the Eastern Province, where lines are under construction and should be completed early in 1916. Communication will eventually be established with the Sudan telegraph system.

During 1911 a railway was completed from Jinja to Kakindu on the Victoria Nile, a distance of 54 miles, giving access to the waterways of Lake Kioga. This has since been extended to Namasagali, 7 miles down stream. A loan from Imperial funds of £125,000l. was granted in 1912 to provide for extensive improvements in the communications on Lake Kioga and in the Eastern Province, to cope with the rapidly increasing output of cotton, and for a railway from Kampala, the principal commercial centre, to Port Bell on Lake Victoria, a distance of 7 miles. This is now completed and open for traffic.

Population.

The estimated population is:

| females        | 272    |
| Asiatics       | 3,456  |
| Africans (estimated) | 2,883,382 |

Total: 2,887,800

Estimated on 31st March, 1916.

Products.

Coffee of the Arabian varieties has been introduced and thrives exceedingly well. Rubber trees and vines are plentiful. A forest area of about 137 square miles has been leased to the Mabira Forest Company, and other Companies and private individuals are undertaking the planting of coffee, rubber, and cocoa on an
extensive scale. These crops are still in the experimental stage, but, despite the attacks of various plant diseases, the outlook is promising. The principal industry is cotton; the export for 1915-16 was 4,967 tons valued at £245,426, a decrease of 105,720l. on the previous year. In addition 5,225 tons of cotton seed were exported, valued at 9,760l. It is all produced by the natives. Cattle are plentiful. Freehold or leasehold grants of land can be obtained from the government.
