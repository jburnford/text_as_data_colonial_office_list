FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S., and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes more uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Taviuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lowerlands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), tin, antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rain keep alive the sources of the thousands of small
affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Dreketi river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hoffua and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1911 to number 2,176, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates, who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner and any number of natives, not exceeding ten). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji. The post of resident commissioner has now been amalgamated with that of provincial medical officer, and a hospital has been established on the island.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881, 1891, 1901, and 1911 respectively, is shown in the following table:

| Class of Population | Males | Females | Total |
|---------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Europeans           |       |         |       |
| Half-Castes         |       |         |       |
| Indians             |       |         |       |
| Polynesians         |       |         |       |
| Fijians             |       |         |       |
| Rotumans            |       |         |       |
| Chinese             |       |         |       |
| Others              |       |         |       |

The estimated population on 31 December, 1915, was 159,321, made up as follows:—Europeans, 4,552; Half-Castes, 2,621; Indians, 56,853; Fijians, 89,562; Polynesians, 2,515; Rotumans, 1,936; Chinese, 669; Others, 613.

The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect, inasmuch as there was then a tendency on the part of the natives to exag-
gerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made, that tendency had taken a turn in the opposite direction, under the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The births among the native population in 1916 totalled 3,822, and the deaths 3,528. The birth rate was 37·4, and the death rate 28·4 per mil.

Indian immigration has replaced Polynesian immigration, hence the respective increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are more suitable than Polynesians for work on sugar plantations. The Indian immigrant population is now estimated at 56,853, and Polynesians number 2,515.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1915:

| Wesleyan | ... | ... | ... | 84,380 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Roman Catholic | ... | ... | ... | 10,256 |

**History.**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the *Bounty*, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australias and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the Chief of Bau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Tavuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

**Climate.**

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1915 was 92·4° in February, and the lowest 58·5° in August. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 99·572 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to September is usually the driest period. Between December and April hurricanes or heavy gales occasionally occur.

**Constitution.**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 21st March, 1904, as amended by Letters Patent of 30th August, 1905, 27th July, 1907, 31st October, 1910, 24th August, 1911, 22nd January, 1914, and 20th July, 1916. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Chief Medical Officer, the Receiver-General, and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and not more than twelve nominated members, seven elected members and two native members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by an occasional meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," which has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, with a white population of 352* souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 1,376 at the census of 1911, and had increased to about 1,530 in 1914.

**Shipping.**

Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1915, 12 vessels registered of a total tonnage of 1,321 tons.

During the year 1915 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 243 vessels, of a total tonnage of 2,653, of which 99 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 1,603), 114 by natives.

* According to the census of 2nd April, 1911.
(tonnage 791), 13 by Chinese (tonnage 149), 5 by Half-caste (tonnage 33), 9 by Indians (tonnage 43), and 3 by Japanese (tonnage 34).

A portion of the revenue, varying from 14,000£ to 16,000£ net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into seventeen provinces, each under the control of a European Commissioner or a Roko Tui (chief native officer) for purposes of native administration. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, which was till lately delivered in the form of produce, but is now, at the discretion of the Governor, paid entirely in money.

The Provincial Council, consisting of native officials and chiefs, presided over by an European Officer of the Government, distributes the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The tax assessment for the whole of the provinces was, in 1916, 16,200£.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1877 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva, on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by the Municipal Institutions Ordinance, 1909. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding two shillings in the pound are further provided for.

A grant-in-aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town council, and in addition the revenue received from certain licenses issued in respect of businesses carried on in a town may be paid to the council.

The revenue and expenditure in 1915 were:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| £       | £           |
| Suva municipal council | 10,251 | 11,739 |
| Levuka | 2,316 | 2,483 |
| Suva school board | 1,131 | 1,122 |
| Levuka | 1,085 | 1,133 |

Total ... £14,783 £16,477

Total receipts of local authorities, 14,783£; total expenditure, 16,477£ in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council; and (2) of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two public schools under these school boards, one in Suva, with an average attendance of 119 scholars, and one in Levuka, with an average attendance of 167 scholars.

There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka (attendance 45), and two in Suva, with 135 scholars on the roll.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide almost entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,040 for natives, with 1,449 teachers and 17,071 scholars; 13 of these schools are for Indians, with 465 scholars.

The latter have 130 schools, with 2,458 scholars.

A Native High School has been established at Nasinu, near Suva, for the higher education of natives. It is maintained by public revenue. The number of scholars is 68. Expenditure on this school from public funds amounted in 1915, to 1,893£.

A school on similar lines has been established in the Lau Province, to be maintained at the expense of the Province, with a subsidy of 300£ a year from General Revenue.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka, and Lautoka, and the Bank of New Zealand at the two former places.

Under Ordinance IV., of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened during 1908. Arrangements were made during 1914 for the issue of Government Currency Notes.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoanut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. In the meantime the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney, Auckland and Melbourne.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples and citrus fruits.
The following table will illustrate the course of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | SUGAR | FRUIT | COPRA |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 96 tons | £3,417 | 97 tons | £57,583 | 3,871 tons | £40,068 |
| 1890 | 15,291 tons | £244,855 | 57,583 tons | £4,657 | 42,901 tons |
| 1900 | 32,981 tons | £393,987 | 28,112 tons | £15,605 | 151,701 tons |
| 1906 | 38,533 tons | £47,196 | 97,678 tons | £9,772 | 144,683 tons |
| 1907 | 66,597 tons | £62,820 | 79,871 tons | £11,290 | 182,768 tons |
| 1908 | 66,149 tons | £67,906 | 62,217 tons | £13,931 | 154,489 tons |
| 1909 | 60,825 tons | £67,069 | 96,401 tons | £15,880 | 226,599 tons |
| 1910 | 61,760 tons | £69,432 | 47,301 tons | £13,082 | 268,914 tons |
| 1911 | 72,834 tons | £79,274 | 151,667 tons | £16,337 | 294,246 tons |
| 1912 | 61,728 tons | £67,713 | 120,610 tons | £13,710 | 242,073 tons |
| 1913 | 94,710 tons | £104,197 | 168,249 tons | £7,929 | 176,741 tons |
| 1914 | 92,112 tons | £106,643 | 201,938 tons | £9,429 | 143,372 tons |
| 1915 | 85,563 tons | £106,463 | 120,741 tons | £15,239 | 233,059 tons |

The other principal exports in 1915 consisted of:
- Sici shell, 27,438L; molasses, 7,591L; rubber, 3,464L; Béche-de-mer, 3,200L; maize, 2,690L; hides and fette, 2,283L; live stock, 1,233L; and wool, 1,180L.

Minor exports consisted of beans, pearl shell, cocoanut, bark, timber, turtle shell, gum, kumalas, skins, coco-nuts, and cow peas.

The growth of rice has been commenced, and the cultivation of sugar cane is being considerably extended.

The planting of rubber has been commenced, and promises to do well. Efforts are being made to encourage the growing of cotton.

Cattle and sheep raising are exciting considerable attention, and many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted to this pursuit.

The total trade of the Colony in 1915 was £2,354,500, made up as follows:

- With United Kingdom: 159,806
- British Possessions: 1,969,336
- Foreign Countries: 220,396
- Parcels Post: 14,962

Total: £2,354,500

There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and the bulk of the trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through the Australian colonies.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the Colony: Sydney (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Auckland (4 days), once a month. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. In addition to this, Suva is a port of call for the Canadian-Australian Royal Mail Line of Steamers which ply between Vancouver and Sydney via Honolulu, Suva, and Auckland. A steam service with Melbourne has been established, and a direct steamer calling at Sydney on return voyage is now running.

Postage to the United Kingdom, India, the Australian States, New Zealand, and British Colonies* is 1d. per oz. To other countries in the Postal Union 2½d. per oz. A war tax of 1d. on letters and parcels posted within the Colony, excepting letters on which the minimum rate of postage is 2½d., has been imposed since 1st Dec., 1915.

Internal postal rates: letters 1d. per oz.; newspapers not exceeding 4 ozs., 1½d., exceeding 4 ozs., 1½d. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is 3 lbs. 1s. 8½d., 7 lbs. 3s. 4½d., and 11 lbs. 5s. There is also a parcels post with the Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, India and Ceylon. The rate of postage is eightpence for the first 1 lb. and sixpence per lb. thereafter to the Australian States and New Zealand, and eightpence per lb. to Canada. In the case of India and Ceylon the rates are 1s. 4½d. for the first 1 lb., and 1s. 2½d. per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

The Imperial Postal Order system has been adopted by this Colony.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco, or Vancouver, in about 30 days.

There is a telephone from Suva to Lautoka, a distance of 125 miles, which is maintained by the Colonial Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Union Steamship Company jointly. There is a telegraph line between Suva and Levuka, a distance of 54 miles. A system of wireless telegraphy has been established in the Colony, and there are now stations at Suva in the island of Viti Levu, at Labasa and Sawusavu in the island of Vanua Levu, and at Waiyevo, Tavuni. Telephone Exchanges have been established at Suva, Levuka, Nausori, and Navua.

There is no railway in the Colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. own various tramlines connecting their estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. Suva is now connected by Pacific Cable with Southport (Queensland) and Auckland, via Norfolk Island, and with Canada, via Fanning Island. Intercommunication within the group is maintained by sailing boats and steam launches, and by subsidised inter-isular steamers. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands, and more are in process of construction.
