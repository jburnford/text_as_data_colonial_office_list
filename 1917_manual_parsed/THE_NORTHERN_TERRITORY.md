THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.

Area and Population.

Upon the extension of New South Wales westward to the 129th meridian in 1827, the Northern Territory was comprised within that colony (see Year Book No. 4, page 16), and in 1863 was annexed by Royal Letters Patent to the province of South Australia. With the adjacent islands, it was transferred to the Commonwealth on 1st January, 1911.

Area and Boundaries.

The total area of this Territory is 523,620 square miles, or 335,116,800 acres. Its length from north to south is about 900 miles, while its breadth from east to west is 560 miles. Its eastern boundary, dividing it from Queensland, is the 138th meridian of east longitude; and its western boundary, separating it from Western Australia, the 129th meridian. Its southern boundary is the 26th parallel of south latitude, dividing it from South Australia. The northern boundary is the coast line of those parts of the Indian Ocean known as the Timor and Arafura Seas. Near the mouth of the Wentworth River, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Coast line is met by the eastern boundary; at Cape Domett, near Cambridge Gulf, the western boundary cuts the northern coast line. The length of coast line is about 1040 miles, or 503 square miles of area to one mile of coast line; an exact survey has, however, not yet been made.

Population.

(i.) Character. In 1881 there were 670 Europeans in the Territory, and at the end of 1914 the number was estimated at 2,452. The Chinese population, at its maximum during the years of railway construction, 1887 and 1888, has gradually dwindled, the estimate for 1914 being 1,033. Japanese, first recorded in 1884, increased up to the year 1898, falling again after five years. The highest recorded population, excluding aborigines, was 7,533 in 1888; the estimate for 1914 was 3,720. The year 1911 was the first in which the population was dominated by the European race. A thirty years table of population, distinguishing races, will be found on page 1166 of the Commonwealth Official Year Book, No. 5. Subsequent to the census of 1911, a revision of the estimates, back to 1901, was made. The results are shewn in the following table:

| Year ended 31st December | Male | Female | Total |
|--------------------------|------|--------|-------|
| 1902                     | 3,847| 627    | 4,474 |

Aborigines.

The interior of the Territory is the most thickly populated by the natives, but it is believed that they are quickly dying out. In these regions, remote from contact with other races, the native has maintained his primitive simplicity, and furnishes an interesting subject of study to the anthropologist and the ethnologist. At the census of 1911, full-blooded aboriginals in the employ of whites, and those who were living in a civilised or a semi-civilised condition in the vicinity of European settlements, were enumerated—the males being 743, females 480; total 1223. Estimates of the total black population of the Territory vary from 20,000 to 50,000.

Historical.

Exploration and Colonisation.

(i.) Coastal Surveys. The coast was surveyed by King in 1817, and by Wickham and Stokes in 1838 and 1839. Port Darwin, the site of Darwin, the present capital, was discovered in the latter year.

(ii.) Exploration of Interior. Leichhardt traversed a great deal of the country in 1844-5, journeying from Queensland to Port Essington. Gregory started from Point Pearce in 1855, and reached Brisbane. Minor explorations were also successfully undertaken.

(iii.) Crossing the Continent. In 1861, Stuart began his transcontinental journey from Adelaide, and reached the north coast in July, 1862. His track has become the main route, and along it the telegraph line is constructed.

(iv.) Demarcation of Boundaries. Upon the extension westwards of New South Wales, in 1827, the Territory was included in that colony, and remained so until 1863, when it was added to South Australia, which in 1836 had been created a separate province.

(v.) The Military Settlement. A military post was formed on Melville Island in 1825. This was transferred in 1827 to Raffles Bay, and a few years later to Port Essington. Little public attention was given to the station, and no attempt at colonisation was made. It was abandoned in 1849.

Control by South Australia.

(i.) Transfer. As a result of representations to the Imperial Government by South Australia, the Territory was incorporated with that State in 1863, and administered through a Government Resident located at Port Darwin up to 31st December, 1910. Early attempts at settlement failed. Ultimately, Port Darwin was chosen for the site of the capital, and Palmerston (now officially named Darwin) founded.

(ii.) Land Legislation. The South Australian Government's land legislation was framed to attract settlers, viz., low rents with easy entry and unencumbered holding over long periods; or grant of fee simple at low price. Special arrangements were made to foster tropical agriculture, including the establishment of botanic gardens at Port Darwin, for observation and experiment. Large "runs" were established on the northern well grassed and watered pastures.

(iii.) Mining. The survey and construction of the overland telegraph revealed the auriferous nature of the country, and gold and other minerals were discovered in various localities. The Government regulated the area of claims and the conditions upon which they were held.

(iv.) Cessation of Supervision by South Australia. Progress was not as marked as was desired, the Territory being thought capable of more rapid development. Accordingly the Federal
and State Governments agreed upon a surrender by the latter as from 1st January, 1911, since which date the Territory has been a dependency of the Commonwealth.

Transfer to Commonwealth.

(i.) The Agreement. An agreement of transfer, afterwards ratified by the representative Parliaments, was made between the two Governments. In accordance with a proclamation issued in the terms of the Commonwealth Acceptance Act (No. 20 of 1910), the transfer was effected on 1st January, 1911.

(ii.) The Northern Territory Acceptance Act. By the Commonwealth Act, the agreement is ratified and approved, the Territory is accepted together with the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway; laws and courts of justice remain in operation, powers and functions of magistrates and officials remain vested; estates and interests continue upon the same terms; trade with Australian States is declared free. The Commonwealth assumes responsibility for the State loans in respect of the Territory, paying the interest yearly to the State, providing a sinking fund to pay off the loans at maturity, and paying off the deficit in respect of the Territory. It also purchases the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway, and agrees to complete the construction of the trans-continental railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta.

(iii.) The South Australian Surrender Act.—The State Act approves and ratifies the agreement surrendering the Territory.

(iv.) The Northern Territory (Administration) Act, 1910.—The Act provides for Government authorising the appointment of an administrator and officials. South Australian laws are declared to continue in force as laws of the Territory and certain Commonwealth Acts to apply. Power is given to the Governor-General to make Ordinances having the force of law.

(v.) Administration.—A Resident Administrator, vested with supreme authority in internal affairs, was appointed in the Department of the Minister for External Affairs in February, 1912. Many other important administrative offices have also been filled.

(vi.) Legislation.—The main provisions of the Ordinances passed are as follows:—The powers and duties of the Administrator vested in the appointee, include custody of the public seal, appointment and suspension of officials, and execution of leases of Crown lands. He is assisted by a council of advice, not exceeding six, and meeting monthly. A Supreme Court with original and appellate jurisdiction is instituted, the method of appointment of the Judge is prescribed, and provision is made for trial by jury, and for the registration and summoning of jurors. A Sheriff, a Registrar-General, and a Health Officer are provided for, also the registration of births, marriages and deaths, and of deeds and documents. District Councils are authorised to assess land values and levy rates on unimproved value. Custody and control of aborigines with extensive powers of supervision are vested in the Chief Protector. Birds protected—some during the year, and some during part of the year, are scheduled. Crown lands are classified, and their mode of acquisition, entry and holding defined. Shop assistants are to have a weekly half holiday, and the establishments must be closed at a certain time. Mining is encouraged by the provision of rewards for the invention of new processes, and the discovery of valuable deposits and of new mineral fields; subsidization of the industry and the issue of prospecting licences are also provided for. Licences to search for mineral oil, and leases of land for the working of the industry are available. A Board is constituted for the purpose of making advances to settlers, who intend to improve and stock their holdings, to purchase farm implements, plant, etc., or to pay off mortgages, the rate of interest and terms of repayment being set out.

Physiography.

Tropical Nature of the Country.—The territory is within the torrid zone, with the exception of a strip, 25 degrees wide, which lies south of the Tropic of Capricorn.

Contour and Physical Characteristics.—The low flat coast line seldom reaches a height of 100 feet. Sandy beaches and mud flats, thickly fringed with mangroves, prevail. Sandstone, marl, and ironstone form the occasional cliffy headlands. The sea frontage of more than 1000 miles is indented by bays and inlets and intersected by numerous rivers, many of which are navigable for considerable distances from their estuaries.

Inland, the country is generally destitute of conspicuous landmarks. From the coast there is a general rise southwards to the vicinity of the 17th or 18th parallel of south latitude, where the higher lands form the watershed between the rivers that flow northwards to the sea, and those that form the scanty supply of the interior systems. Towards the centre of the continent the land over a wide area is of considerable elevation, and there are several mountain ranges, generally with an east and west trend.

Climate.

On the northern coast, as in the tropics generally, there are two main climatic divisions—the wet season, November to April, and the dry season, May to October. The changes of season are uniform and regular. Immediately after the vernal equinox, the wet season is heralded by the cessation of the east-south-easterly monsoon, which gives place to calm and light variable winds. Intensely hot weather prevails for a few days, thunder-clouds gathering and increasing daily until they burst in heavy thunderstorms accompanied by hurricanes, and increasing in strength and frequency until the end of November, when they become of almost daily occurrence, about an inch of rain falling during each storm. During December the north-west monsoon sets in gradually, with rain nearly every day, and increasing in force until about the end of January. At this period of the year the wet season penetrates into the heart of the continent. This monsoon dies away at the autumnal equinox, and is succeeded by light and variable winds till the end of April, when the dry season commences with the setting in of the south-east monsoon. Nearly the whole of the rainfall occurs in the summer months.

Fauna and Flora.

Native Animals.—The ordinary types of Australian fauna inhabit the territory. As elsewhere on the continent, the higher Theria are rare. There are many genera of marsupials, and individuals are numerous. The birds also are typically Australian, with brilliant plumage, and not generally gifted with song. Crocodiles
and fresh-water tortoises frequent the northern rivers. There are some species of snakes, mostly non-venomous, the most numerous being the harmless python. Frogs abound, the water-holding frog being common in Central Australia. The rivers contain many varieties of freshwater fish. The molluscan fauna of the coast are mostly carnivorous, the vegetable feeders being very poorly represented, probably on account of the dearth of seaweed. Land and freshwater shellfish are not abundant. Among insects, many beautiful butterflies thrive in the warm damp atmosphere. Beetles also are strongly represented. The white ant is a pest, very few timbers being immune from its ravages. Anthills in the Territory sometimes attain a height of twenty-five feet and a diameter of ten feet. Another destructive insect, particularly active and mischievous inland, is the borer. Mosquitoes and sandflies are very troublesome, particularly from January to April. There are not many crustaceans.

Imported Stock.—Buffalo thrive in the Territory. At Port Essington they are numerous, and there are large herds on Melville Island. Timor ponies have also been introduced. Imported sheep and horned cattle thrive on the stations.

Protection of Fauna.—Ruthless destruction of native birds is prohibited. An Ordinance (No. 1 of 1912) gives the Administrator power to declare that any bird is protected; and provides that permits to export protected birds, or the skins or eggs of such birds, will only be issued subject to such conditions as the Administrator directs.

Flora.—The vegetation is tropical, many of the forms belonging to the Malayan and Oceanic regions. The timber trees are not of great commercial value, but in the coastal regions tropical vegetation grows luxuriantly to the water's edge. The indented arms of the coast are thickly fringed with the mangrove. On the ranges, pines, fig trees, and orange trees flourish. The Roper River drains extensive forest lands. Leichhardt pines and palms form the vegetation of the tableland, which stretches across the Territory about the 14th degree of south latitude. On the higher steppes there are a few varieties of eucalypts, and many fibre plants are also indigenous. On the wide expanses of plain country of the interior, there is little vegetation, tree growth being very scanty, consisting chiefly of stunted eucalypts, such as the gumlet gum, black box, and desert sheoak. In the north-western districts there is an almost entire absence of lichens and mosses, though ferns are plentiful in the vicinity of the Victoria River. The following orders are well represented:—Euphorbiaceae, Composite, Convolvulaceae, Rubiaceae, Goodeniaceae, Leguminoseae, Urticaceae.

Production.

There is no great home consumption of the articles produced in the Territory, the greater part being exported overseas and to the States of the Commonwealth.

Stock.—The spacious, well-grassed "runs" of the Territory are suitable for horse and cattle breeding. It is anticipated that the cattle trade with the East will develop. Large numbers are overlanded to neighbouring States, which also take considerable quantities of horse hides. The estimated number of stock on 31st December, 1914, was:

Live Stock, Northern Territory, 31st December, 1914.—Horses, 21,985; cattle, 414,558; sheep, 70,200; pigs, 1,246; goats (31st Dec., 1913), 8,806.

Dairying as an industry is non-existent. The abundant indigenous herbage is, however, well suited for stock, and the making of hay and ensilage would ensure the development of the industry.

Mining.—Considerable quantities of the precious and commercial metals are mined. The discovery of gold and tin in various localities, and the measure of success that has attended their working, indicate scope for development. Both alluvial and reef gold are found, and there are several batteries and cyanide plants. The following table shews the total mineral production for 21 years.

| Year | Gold | Tin Ore | Wolfram | Silver Lead | Copper Ore | Smelter Product (C'pp'r Base) | Total Value |

(ii.) Mining Accidents, 1900 to 1914. In 1911 five mining accidents were recorded, four resulting in death. There were no serious accidents in 1910, 1912 and 1913. In 1914 there was one death from accident. During the nine years preceding (1901-1909), nine fatal accidents and seven cases of serious injury were recorded, the majority of the victims being Chinese.

Pearl Shell.

In 1884 mother-of-pearl shell was discovered in the harbour of Port Darwin. Difficulty in working, principally through heavy tides and muddy water, retarded the development of the industry for many years. Latterly, however, the opening up of new patches has led to a revival. In 1914, forty-two boats were engaged, valued, with their equipment, at about £6,600; 250 men were employed. Twenty-five tons of pearl shell were obtained, valued at £6,110 Béche-de-mer valued at £2,969 was also raised and 312 lbs. of tortoiseshell, valued at £265.

Commerce and Shipping.

Trade.—The following table shows the total trade of the Territory for ten years from 1901 to 1910:

| Year | Imports | Exports | Total Trade |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1901 | 108,896 | 302,931 | 411,817     |
| 1902 | 107,217 | 191,568 | 298,775     |
| 1903 | 135,244 | 178,366 | 303,510     |
| 1904 | 113,461 | 235,650 | 349,111     |
| 1905 | 66,978  | 216,279 | 303,157     |
| 1906 | 74,659  | 264,222 | 328,881     |

| 1909 | 67,994  | 278,555 | 336,540     |
| 1910 | 53,896  | 269,063 | 321,961     |

No record is now kept of the direction of trade between the Commonwealth States and Territories. It is, therefore, impossible to give the total imports and exports of the Northern Territory for years later than 1910. The figures for 1911, and following years are given below, with the average annual trade in five year periods from 1881 to 1910.

Value of Imports and Exports, Northern Territory, 1881 to 1910, and 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914-15, and 1915-16.

Shipping.—The Territory's overseas commerce is carried in British and Japanese bottoms. One of the British lines maintains a monthly service, other lines are irregular. Coastal shipping is chiefly in Australian vessels. There is a small local trade, a steamship running between Port Darwin, Port McArthur, Daly River, Victoria River, and Wyndham (Western Australia).

Internal Communication.

Railways.—Under the agreement ratified by the Act the Commonwealth is to construct the Northern Territory portion of the transcontinental railway line (connecting Adelaide and Darwin, via Port Augusta).

The Northern line from Adelaide terminates at Oodnadatta, about 100 miles south of the southern boundary of the Territory. The only line at present in the Territory is one from Darwin to Pine Creek, a length of 145½ miles, of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge; and Pine Creek is distant about 1,100 miles from Oodnadatta. The extension of this line southwards from Pine Creek to Katherine River is being proceeded with. It is stated that this transcontinental railway would bring London within seventeen days of Adelaide. The Commonwealth also acquired on 1st January, 1911, the property in the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.

Posts.—The principal mail services are as follows:—

(i.) Marine. Postal communication is maintained between Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, via North Queensland ports. The service extends to China and Japan. There is also a quarterly contract service between Darwin and Boroloola, calling half-yearly at Roper River; and a service...
every two months between Darwin and Wyndham, on the estuary of Ord River, in the northeast of Western Australia. These are subsided according to agreement for three years, the amount for the first service being £350; and for the second, £125 per voyage.

(ii.) Inland. Posts are also despatched into the interior of the Continent. One route is from the Katherine Telegraph Station southwards as far as Renner Springs, and then eastwards to Anthony Lagoon, where the Queensland mailman is met. The service is maintained with difficulty, on account of the many hardships caused by the alternations of extreme drought and flood.

Other inland routes are served, and there is a frequent service in Darwin.

Telegraphs.—The transcontinental telegraph line, covering a length of 2,230 miles, was completed on 2nd August, 1872, at a cost of nearly half-a-million sterling. The line runs in a northerly direction from Adelaide to Darwin, whence telegraphic communication is provided with Asia and Europe, via Banjoewangie (Java), Singapore and Madras.

Between Darwin and Banjoewangie the submarine cable is duplicated.

Land Tenure.

The system of land settlement in the Northern Territory has been reorganised by the Commonwealth Government. The Lands Ordinances of 1912, 1913 and 1914, regulate the future disposal of land in the Territory. A leasehold system only is provided for, and no further alienation of Crown lands will be permitted, unless such alienation is in pursuance of existing agreements. The classification and control of Crown lands is in the hands of a Board, consisting of the Director of Lands, the Director of Agriculture, and the Chief Surveyor. The classified land is leased in blocks, the maximum area ranging from 300 square miles of first-class pastoral to 1280 acres of first-class agricultural land. Before offering any land for leasing, the Board fixes the annual rental, but every lease is subject to reappraisement of rent at specified periods, viz., every 14 years in the case of town lands, and every 21 years in the case of agricultural and pastoral lands.

Leases under these Ordinances are in perpetuity, except as regards pastoral and miscellaneous leases, the term of which is 21 or 42 years, according to the quality of the land leased.

The lessee must reside on the land leased for a certain period every year, must fence, stock, and cultivate it to the extent prescribed, and must, within two years of the commencement of the lease, establish a home on it. In order to promote settlement in the Territory, the first five thousand blocks of agricultural land taken up on perpetual lease under this Ordinance will be rent free during the life of the applicant, or for 21 years from the commencement of the lease, whichever period is longer.

Many farms have already been surveyed on the Daly river, varying in size from 290 to 620 acres, and are now being allotted. The Government provides fencing, building materials, implements, and stock at cost price, and on long terms, or advances the money required for their purchase.

The various types of leases, licenses, and permits current are as follows:—(i.) Agricultural leases; (ii.) pastoral leases; (iii.) special leases; (iv.) leases with right of purchase; (v.) tropical products leases; (vi.) leases for horsebreeding stations; (vii.) licenses; and (viii.) pastoral and other permits.

(i.) Area held under Lease, License and Permit.
