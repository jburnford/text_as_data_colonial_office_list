THE COMMONWEALTH.

The Commonwealth of Australia is constituted under an Act passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1900—63 & 64 Vict., cap. 12. By this Act it was made lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy Council, to proclaim that, on and after a day appointed in the proclamation, the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, and also if Her Majesty were satisfied that the people of Western Australia had agreed thereto, of Western Australia, should be united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia.

A proclamation was accordingly issued by Her Majesty on the 17th of September, 1900, appointing the 1st of January, 1901, as the day on which the Commonwealth should be established—Western Australia being included in accordance with the result of a referendum taken before that date in the Colony and with Addresses passed by both Houses of the Legislature.

A short history of the events leading up to the establishment of the Commonwealth, and of the provisions of the Constitution, as fixed by the Act of Parliament above quoted, is given below. The account of the different States of the Commonwealth is arranged alphabetically, and a description of territories dependent on the Commonwealth follows.

The Earl of Hopetoun (afterwards Marquis of Linlithgow) was selected as the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth, and a Commission was issued to him on the 29th of October, 1900.

It was announced in September that the Queen would issue a special Commission to H.R.H. the Duke of York, for opening in Her Majesty's name the first session of the Commonwealth Parliament in the spring of 1901, and that H.R.H., accompanied by the Duchess of York, would pay visits to the different States of the Commonwealth. At the invitation of the Government of New South Wales, a representative body of troops, about 1,000 strong, sailed from England in November, to attend the inauguration of the Commonwealth at Sydney on the 1st of January, 1901. A small detachment of officers and non-commissioned officers of the Indian Army also proceeded to Sydney on the same occasion. The Commission issued by the Queen to the Duke of York was renewed on the accession of King Edward VII. The Duke and Duchess landed at Melbourne on the 6th of May, and on the 9th the Duke opened the first session in the Exhibition Building at Melbourne. The Duke and Duchess subsequently visited Brisbane, Sydney, New Zealand, Hobart, Adelaide and Perth, leaving Australia on the 26th of July to continue their tour to Mauritius, South Africa and North America.

Australian Federation.

Until the passing of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act the only means of joint legislative action in Australia was provided by the "Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act created a Council of two members from each Colony which adopted the Act, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which had only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. Such an increase was upon the request of the Legislatures made by Her Majesty on 3rd March, 1894, when an Order in Council was passed, providing that each Colony which was or should be represented on the Federal Council, except any Crown Colony, be represented by five members. This Council had power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, service and enforcement respectively of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they had been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies might also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, status of corporations, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters was to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters should have been so referred, and such Colonies as might afterwards adopt the same. It had also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent. The Council was to meet at least once in every two years.

The first meeting took place on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed authorising the service of the civil powers and the enforcement of the judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened on 16th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Béche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland. The Council met for its third session on 29th January, 1889, when representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. An Act was passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Béche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Western Australia.
The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject subsequently passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened 20th January, and closed 24th January, 1891. South Australia was not represented, the Act (a temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Council having expired. The only Bill passed was one to facilitate the recognition in other Colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any Colony in matters of lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to the acquisition of land in, and trading with, natives of the New Hebrides.

The fifth session was commenced on 26th January, 1893, when the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Thursday Island; and a resolution was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony, to five. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and also for securing the adhesion of the Colonies not represented in the Council. As the result of action taken by the Standing Committee, the Legislatures of all the Colonies in the Council addressed Her Majesty, requesting that the proposed increase in the number of representatives might be made; and, on 3rd March, 1894, Her Majesty was pleased to make an Order in Council providing "that each Colony which is or shall be represented in the said Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members."

The sixth session opened on the 30th January, 1895, when the same four Colonies were represented as at the preceding session. There were present, for the first time, five delegates from each Colony. At this session no Bills were brought forward, but resolutions were adopted affirming the desirability of defining the status, and of granting facilities for the winding up of companies carrying on business in different Colonies; of rendering uniform the laws relating to banking; of establishing an effectual system of quarantine; of adopting a more economic method of raising public loans; and of taking steps with a view to the holding of a second Federation Convention. An address to the Queen was also adopted praying for the appointment of an Australasian representative on the Privy Council Bench, in view of the special features often presented by Australasian appeals.

The seventh session was commenced on 26th January, 1897, when the Colonies of Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia, were represented. An Act was passed, upon a reference of the matter to the Council by the Legislatures of Victoria and Queensland, to provide for the naturalisation within the Australian Colonies, or some of them, of persons of European descent naturalised in any of such Colonies, also upon a reference of the subject by the Legislatures of Tasmania, Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, an Act was passed to make provision for the enforcement in certain cases within the Australasian Colonies, or some of them, of Orders of the Supreme Court of such Colonies for the production of testamentary instruments. The Council adopted an Address to Her Majesty, referring to the Address adopted in 1891 with regard to restrictions in the way of trade with the natives of the New Hebrides, urging that negotiations may be entered into with the other Powers concerned with a view to imposing on their subjects equal restrictions in that trade. This and all the previous sessions were held at Hobart. The Council resolved that the place of its next meeting should be Melbourne.

The Commonwealth Act.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement was made for the establishment of a more effective Federation, to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven principal Australasian Colonies met in Melbourne, on the 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best interests of the Australian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint to a National Australasian Convention during the year 1890 delegates empowered to report upon the scheme for a Federal Constitution.

In accordance with these resolutions, delegates were appointed, and the Convention commenced its deliberations in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891. After an animated discussion, which lasted more than five weeks, a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia" was drawn up and adopted. This Bill the Convention recommended should be submitted by the Parliaments for the approval of the people of the several Colonies. It provided for the union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown, for a Governor-General to be appointed by the Crown, who should be aided and advised by an Executive Council, the constitution of a Senate and House of Representatives, with certain definite powers, the latter to have the initiation of money bills, which the former might pass or reject, but not amend, and for the establishment of a Federal Judicature; the revenue of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Customs and Excise duties, and other taxation, which should be collected by Federal officers, and expended as required for Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to the respective Colonies. It also provided for absolute Free Trade internally throughout the Commonwealth, so soon as the Parliament should have imposed uniform Customs duties. The draft Bill of 1891, though it crystallised the idea of Federation, failed to command the serious attention of the Legislatures, and Federalists began a popular agitation to place the movement on a new footing.

A meeting of the Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies took place in Hobart in January, 1895, and agreed to a scheme for framing a Federal Constitution to be submitted for the approval of their respective Parliaments. The enabling Bill, adopted at this Conference providing for the election by each Colony of 10 delegates to prepare a scheme of Federation, was adopted by the Parliaments of N. S. Wales, Victoria, S. Australia, and Tasmania, and in a modified form by Western Australia.

Delegates were accordingly duly elected and assembled in Convention at Adelaide on 22nd March, 1897, for the purpose of drafting a constitution. Having prepared a "Bill to constitute a Commonwealth of Australia," the Convention was on the 23rd April adjourned to reassemble at
Sydney on 2nd September. The draft Bill was in the meantime submitted to the local Legislatures, and various amendments were suggested by those bodies. The Bill, together with those amendments, was further considered by the Delegates at the Sydney Session of the Convention, and a long discussion took place on various proposals submitted for settling questions of difference between the two Houses of the new Federal Legislature. Considerable progress was made with the rest of the measure, but the work of revision was not completed, and the Convention adjourned until 20th January, 1896, partly in the hope of seeing Delegates from Queensland join in the final discussion. This hope was not realised, as the Queensland Legislature, for the second time, shelved the Enabling Bill.

The Convention met again at Melbourne on the 20th of January, 1896, and remained in session till the 17th of March, and a Bill was adopted which in accordance with the Federation Enabling Acts of the different Colonies was submitted to the popular vote for acceptance or rejection. In Victoria the polling was—For acceptance, 100,520; against, 22,099. The Bill was also accepted by the vote of the people in South Australia and Tasmania. But in New South Wales the statutory minimum number of 80,000 affirmative votes required by the Enabling Act of that Colony was not obtained, and the matter fell through for the time.

A further Conference of Premiers was held at Melbourne in January, 1899, to consider the objections of New South Wales; and this time Queensland was represented. The Premiers met in a spirit of compromise, and on the 2nd of February an agreement was come to which all the Premiers agreed to submit to their Parliaments for reference to the electors, it being understood that New South Wales should lead this way. South Australia, however, for purposes of local convenience, took a referendum vote upon the Bill on the occasion of the General Election, without waiting for New South Wales. This vote was taken on the 29th of April, when 65,990 votes were given for Federation and 17,063 against.

In New South Wales the Bill providing for the reference to the people of the amended draft constitution was passed by the Lower House on the 2nd of March, but in the Upper House amendments were made. One of these required that one-third of the electors on the register should vote for the Bill in order to secure its acceptance. The Bill as amended passed the Legislative Council on the 21st of March. On March the 22nd the Lower House rejected the amendments of the Upper House. The latter body refused to give way. A conference between the two Houses was held without result on the 28th of March. Mr. Reid, Premier of New South Wales, prorogued Parliament for a few days, and on his advice the Governor added twelve new members to the Council. The Bill was re-introduced in the Lower House, and passed on the 13th of April. It was accepted by the Legislative Council with an unimportant amendment (providing that a period of eight weeks should elapse before the referendum was taken) on the 20th of April, and on the 25th of April it was announced that the question would be submitted to the electors on the 20th of June. It was accepted by a majority of about 25,000.

On the 27th July, the amended Commonwealth Bill was accepted by overwhelming majorities in Victoria and Tasmania, and on the 2nd September by a majority of about 7,500 in Queensland. The delay in taking action in Western Australia led to some correspondence between Sir John Forrest, Premier of Western Australia, and Mr. Reid. Mr. Reid declared on behalf of the Federating Colonies that no amendments to meet the views entertained in Western Australia could now be considered; and the same assurance was repeated by Sir G. Turner, Premier of Victoria. Sir J. Forrest, in fulfilment of his undertaking at the Premiers' conference, brought the draft Constitution before the Legislature, which referred it to a Select Committee, who reported that it should not be accepted without considerable amendment. The Legislative Council finally refused to allow a referendum to be taken.

Addresses to the Queen from the five Colonies which had accepted the Constitution praying for the enactment of the Commonwealth Bill were received in the autumn of 1899.

As it appeared that some alterations in the Bill might be required by the Imperial Government, Mr. Chamberlain telegraphed to the Governor of New South Wales, expressing the hope that Delegates were coming home to advise and assist during the passage of the Bill through Parliament.

Delegates were appointed, and reached England in March. Western Australia also sent a Delegate to represent the views of that Colony, and the Agent-General for New Zealand was appointed to watch the interests of New Zealand.

The discussion between Her Majesty's Government and the Delegates turned chiefly on the clauses of the Bill relating to the Appeals to the Privy Council. Under the Bill, in Section 74, appeals were allowed both from the Supreme Courts of the States and from the Federal High Court, but there was a limitation in cases affecting the interpretation of the Constitution of the Commonwealth or of a State "unless the public interests of some part of Her Majesty's dominions other than the Commonwealth or a State are involved." Various memoranda passed on this subject of Clause 74, the Delegates demurring to any alteration in the Bill, whilst Her Majesty's Government pointed out the difficulty of interpreting the Clause, and the danger that it might unduly restrict the right of appeal in cases where the interests of foreigners or British subjects outside Australia were affected.

The Bill was introduced into Parliament with amendments to secure Her Majesty's prerogative to grant special leave of appeal from the High Court of the Commonwealth or the Supreme Court of any State to the Privy Council. But the discussion with the Delegates continued, and two successive compromises were arrived at. First, the appeal on Constitutional questions was made dependent on the consent of the Executive Government or Governments concerned, and finally was made dependent on a certificate to be granted at the discretion of the High Court.

No other amendments of any consequence were made by Parliament in the Bill as received from Australia, except that provision was made for the inclusion of Western Australia as an original State, provided that Her Majesty was satisfied that the people of that Colony had agreed thereto prior to the issue of the Proclamation.

The Queen caused to be sent to Australia, for presentation to the Commonwealth Parliament, a duplicate of the Commission issued for the formal declaration of Her assent to the Act, together with the pen, inkstand, and table used on the occasion of its signature. She subsequently presented a duplicate of the Proclamation bringing the Act into force, duly signed and passed under the Great Seal.
Constitution of the Commonwealth.

The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia is contained in the Act of Parliament 63 & 64 Vict., cap. 12. The opening part of the Act recites that the union is to be indissoluble and provides for the admission of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the Queen. It makes provision for the proclamation and date of establishment of the Commonwealth, declares the binding force of Commonwealth laws, and makes definitions. The Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885, is repealed, and the Commonwealth is declared to be a single self-governing Colony for the purposes of the Colonial Boundaries Act.

The leading features of the Constitution proper are as follows:

The Parliament consists of the King, a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Governor-General acts for the King.

The Senate consists of six members from each State. The number may be increased or diminished, but so that the equal representation of the original States is maintained, and no original State has less than six Senators. Qualifications for Senators are the same as those for Members of the House of Representatives, as given below. Senators are chosen for six years. The qualifications of electors for the first Parliament were those for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State in which the elector was competent to vote. In the first Parliament of the Commonwealth the Franchise Act, 1902, unified the franchise for both Houses, on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

The House of Representatives has approximately twice as many members as the Senate, and the number of members for each State is in proportion to the population, but not less than five for any State. The qualifications of electors are as stated in the preceding paragraph. Each elector is to vote only once. Qualification of a Member to be (a) 21 years of age; (b) to be an elector or entitled to be; (c) resident 3 years; (d) natural born or naturalised 5 years.

House may continue to exist for 3 years from first meeting, but may be dissolved sooner; number of members may be increased or diminished by Parliament, subject to the Constitution.

The general powers of the Parliament are grouped under 39 headings, the principal of which are to make laws for trade, taxation, bounties, borrowing, postal services, naval and military, census and statistics, currency, banking, insolvency, corporations, divorce, marriage, old age pensions, immigration and emigration, railways, &c. Exclusive powers in regard to the seat of Government, State departments transferred, and other matters declared by the Constitution to be within the exclusive power of the Parliament.

Money Bills not to originate in, nor to be amended by the Senate, which House may, however, return the Bill requesting any omission or amendment. Equal power in all other matters. Tacking Bills prohibited.

Provision for Dead-locks.—Joint dissolution, and if again passed in Lower House and rejected in Senate a joint sitting to be held, and if passed by an absolute majority of total number of both Houses disputed Bill to become law.

A Bill having passed both Houses the Governor-General shall either assent, withhold assent, reserve the Bill or return it, and recommend amendments. Executive power vested in King and exercisable by Governor-General in Council, who may appoint Ministers of State.

State departments of Customs and Excise transferred to Commonwealth on its establishment. Departments of posts, naval and military, defence, light-houses, &c., and quarantine, on a date or dates to be proclaimed.

High Court of Australia established; appellate and original jurisdiction.

Collection of Customs to pass to Commonwealth. Customs and Excise duties to be uniform, and intercolonial free-trade established within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, after which period the Federal Government shall have exclusive power to levy such duties and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods. Western Australia may continue duties in force on intercolonial goods at the establishment of uniform tariff for five years, subject to reduction of one-fifth each year.

Of the net revenue from Customs and Excise not more than one-fourth to be applied by Commonwealth towards its expenditure. This holds good for the first 10 years and thereafter until the Parliament provides otherwise (Braddon clause).

Right of States to reasonable use of river waters for conservation or irrigation reserved.

Inter-State Commission provided for to regulate trade and commerce, and prevent discriminations being made by any State which may be deemed unreasonable or unjust to any other State.

Constitutions, powers, and laws of States protected. State Debts may be taken over.

Admission of new States provided for. Commonwealth to protect States against invasion or domestic violence.

Seat of Government to be in New South Wales, not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and to be within Federal territory. Parliament to meet at Melbourne until it meets at the new capital.

An alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of any State, or the minimum number of representatives of a State, or altering its limits, or in any way affecting the provisions of the Constitution in relation to it, shall not become law without the approval of a majority of the electors of such State.

The financial portion of the Act is too intricate to be briefly summarised. See Sections 81-105 of the Act.

Constitution may be altered by an absolute majority of each House; then to be submitted to electors, and if in a majority of States a majority of electors voting approve, also majority of all electors approve, then the change may be made. In case of a dead-lock between the two Houses, renewed after three months' interval, the Governor-General may submit the question to the electors in each State qualified to vote for the Lower House.

Two questions, both dealing with finance, were submitted to a referendum concurrently with the Federal elections of April 13th, 1910. The first provided that the Commonwealth should take the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise, and pay to the States a sum equal to one pound five shillings per annum per head of their population, to be determined according to the latest available Commonwealth statistics. A special payment was to be made to Western Australia, in view of the large contribution per capita made by that State to the Customs revenue. It was intended that this arrangement should take the place of the Braddon clause but it was rejected by the electorate. The second proposal related to the conversion of the State debts. The
Constitution provided for the conversion of all the debts existing at the time of Federation, and it was the object of the second proposal to amend the Constitution so as to give the Commonwealth unlimited power to assume all State debts existing at any time. This was passed but the Commonwealth has not yet taken advantage of the powers thus conferred upon it.

Two more "proposed laws" for the alteration of the Constitution were submitted to a referendum on 26th April, 1911. They were:

A Constitution Alteration (Legislative Powers) 1910, and

B Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) 1910.

The object of A was to extend the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament in four directions (a) Trades and Commerce (b) Corporations (c) Industrial Matters and (d) Trusts and Monopolies. The result would have been a great change in section 51 of the Constitution. The object of B was to give the Commonwealth the power of making laws for, or assuming control of, any business or industry which was declared by resolution of both Houses to be the subject of any monopoly. Both resolutions were rejected by a large majority. At the general election of 1913 (May 31st), six questions were submitted to referendum; each question representing a proposed alteration of the Constitution, on which the electors were asked to decide. Of these, five were the old questions of 1911 re-submitted, and the sixth dealt with railway disputes. All the proposals were again rejected but by much smaller majorities than in 1911.

It will be observed from the summary given above that the Constitution follows that of the United States rather than that of Canada so far as the distribution of Federal and State powers is concerned. The matters belonging to the Commonwealth are limited to those expressly specified, and in other respects State powers are maintained. But its general political scheme rests on the doctrine of the constant responsibility to Parliament of an Administration formed with the approval of the Representative of the Crown.

The Governorships of the States are still filled by the Crown, and the Governors correspond on State business directly with the Secretary of State. The Governor-General is, however, kept informed of the correspondence passing between the Governors of the different States and the Colonial Office.

Legislation, &c.

Up to the present time the Parliament of the Commonwealth has sat in Melbourne, the State Parliamentary buildings being assigned to them, and the State Parliament occupying the Exhibition building in that city. The selection of a site for the capital of the Commonwealth (which under the Constitution Act must be in N.S.W. but not less than 100 miles from Sydney) has been under active consideration, and in 1908 it was decided in both Houses that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth should be at Canberra, N.S.W.

The subjects engaging the attention of the Federal Parliament have been numerous and important. In 1901 among other measures the following Acts were passed: the Customs Act, the Post and Telegraph Act, the Immigration Restriction Act, and the Pacific Island Labourers' Act, the last having the effect of putting an end within a definite time to the employment of Kanaka labour in Queensland.

The Tariff was provisionally brought into effect, and inter-state free trade established in October, 1901, but the discussion extended over the greater part of the following year, when the Act was finally passed, uniform customs duties being imposed by the Customs Tariff Act, 1902. The Public Service and Electoral Acts and other measures were also passed into law in 1902; and further provision was made for the Governor-General's establishment. The Commonwealth Franchise Act, providing for a uniform federal franchise on the basis of adult suffrage, was also passed.

Sir E. Barton, then Prime Minister, visited England in 1902, and attended the King's Coronation as Representative of Australia. He took part in the Colonial Conference held in London at that time, as also did Sir John Forrest, then Commonwealth Minister of State for Defence.

In 1903 the Judiciary Act was passed organising the High Court of Australia as provided for in the Constitution. It provides for a Chief Justice and two other Justices. (The Judiciary Act of 1906 provides for two additional Justices, and a similar Act of 1912 for a further two.) It confers upon the High Court certain original jurisdiction in addition to that conferred by the Constitution, and makes the original jurisdiction of the Court exclusive in certain cases. It also regulates and defines the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, and provides that in matters of Federal jurisdiction there shall be no appeal from the State Courts to the Privy Council except through the High Court. The High Court Procedure Act, 1903, establishes a system of procedure for the Court.

The Naval Agreement Act, 1903, ratifies the agreement entered into between the Admiralty and the Governments of the Commonwealth and of New Zealand, providing for an increased Naval Force on the Australian Station. In 1909, the establishment of an Australian Fleet Unit was decided upon. Part of this Unit has now taken the place of the squadron previously maintained under the agreement. There were also passed in 1903 a Naturalisation Act, an Extradition Act, a Patents Act, a Defence Act and other measures.

In 1904 a comprehensive measure relating to Navigation and Shipping was introduced into the Federal Parliament, and was referred to a Royal Commission. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, applying to labour disputes, was the subject of much discussion. An amendment applying the Bill to State employees was carried against the Government, and Mr. Deakin, who had succeeded Sir E. Barton as Prime Minister, resigned. Mr. Watson, who then formed a Government, was in turn defeated in connection with the same Bill, and Mr. Reid became Prime Minister in August. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed in December, 1904. There was also passed an Act relating to the sea-carriage of goods—somewhat on the lines of the "Harter Act" in the United States—which prevents shipowners from contracting themselves out of liability for negligence. The Defence Act, 1904, instituted a Council of Defence and Boards of Naval and Military Administration. The offices of Inspector-General of the Military Forces and Director of Naval Forces were created. Other measures of minor importance were enacted in 1904.

In 1905 several important measures were passed. Amongst these were the Papua Act, granting a constitution to British New Guinea; the Trade Marks and Copyright Acts, making uniform laws throughout the Commonwealth in regard to trade marks and copyrights; the
Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act, to prevent the application of false trade descriptions to imports and exports; the Secret Commissions Act, to prevent the receipt of secret commissions and rebates by agents; and the Census and Statistics Act.

In 1906, amongst other measures, was passed the Australian Industries Preservation Act, which is directed against injurious trusts and monopolies and unfair competition with intent to injure Australian industries, and which also contains provisions to prevent "dumping"; the Designs Act, which deals with copyright in industrial designs, and, in conjunction with the Patents and Trade Marks Acts, previously passed, completes the legislation for the protection of industrial property; an Act increasing the number of the Justices of the High Court of Australia from three to five; an Act granting a reciprocal customs preference to the Colonies and Protectorates forming the South African Union; special Customs and Excise Tariff Acts relating to Agricultural Machinery; a new Excise Tariff on Spirits; a Spirits Act, providing for the proper description and maturing of spirits for human consumption, and affording facilities for the use of spirits in the arts and manufactures, in scientific investigation, and for lighting, heating, and power purposes; and a Meteorology Act.

The principal enactments of 1907 provided for the taxation by States of salaries earned under the Commonwealth; the settlement of questions regarding Parliamentary qualifications and vacancies; the increase of salaries of members of Parliament from 400l. to 600l. per annum; the payment of bounties for the production of cotton, fibres (jute, flax and hemp), oil materials, rice, rubber, coffee, tobacco leaf, preserved fish, and dried fruits, and for the export of combed wool or tops. The survey of route for a transcontinental (Kalgoorlie, W.A., to Port Augusta, S.A.) railway was also authorised.

The more important measures of 1908 were Acts providing for the isolation, detention, protection, etc., of vessels, persons, goods, animals, and plants; and the prevention of the introduction or spread of diseases or pests affecting men, animals or plants; the authorisation of the publication of Parliamentary papers by either House of Parliament, and the exemption from legal proceedings of the publisher. The Customs and Excise Tariffs amended the duties of customs and excise as from 8th August, 1907, the former providing for British preference. The Surplus Revenue Act deleted the provision of the 93rd section of the Constitution, and substituted fresh provisions for the payment of surplus revenue by the Commonwealth to the States. Special appropriations were made, whereby an Invalid and Old Age Pensions Fund and a Harbour and Coast Defence (Naval) Account was created; and the payment of Invalid and Old Age Pensions as from 1st July, 1909, (or such earlier day as is fixed by Parliament) was enacted. By the Seat of Government Act, Canberra was determined as the site of the Commonwealth capital. Authority was given by the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act to pay bounties for iron, steel and wire manufactures.

A very important measure of 1909 extended the provisions of the Defence Act, decreeing compulsory training, for defence, of male inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and the necessary registration and enrolment; the establishment of a Military College was also enacted. Other important measures were those extending the operation of the Old Age Pensions Act; repressing commercial monopolies; authorising the issue of silver and bronze coinage; constituting the office of High Commissioner of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom; regulating marine insurance; providing for payment of compensation by employers to seamen injured while at work, etc. Industrial organisations are recognised, an employer being forbidden to dismiss an employee on account of his membership of an association, that is, or is applying to be, registered as an organisation; nor is an employee to cease work on account of a corresponding application by his employer. Amending Election and Patents Acts were also passed.

In 1910 provision was made for payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for pensions and Naval Defence. The establishment and maintenance of an Australian navy was also provided for, and the period of service under the defence scheme lengthened. Authority for the administration of the Federal Capital Territory and for the Northern Territory was given. The elimination of the words "as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth," altered the provisions of the Constitution relating to the taking over of the States' debts. Provision was made for the issue of Australian notes by the Commonwealth Treasurer, and for the issue of Treasury bills for the redemption of the notes, bank notes being taxed; postal rates were amended. Payment of bounties was authorised on the manufacture of kerosine and paraffin wax from Australian shale. Severe penalties were imposed, under the Immigration Restriction Act, upon persons concerned in bringing immigrants secretly to the Commonwealth, or guilty of deception in regard to naturalisation papers. Emigration of aboriginals, and of children under theatrical contracts was prohibited. Restrictions were placed upon the exportation of arms, military and naval stores, goods necessary for the preservation of the Australian fauna and flora, and articles not conforming to the prescribed conditions as to purity and soundness. A progressive land tax was imposed upon unimproved values. Jurisdiction was given to the High Court in constitutional matters referred to it by the Governor-General. The president of the arbitration court was given power to convene a compulsory conference, to direct that preference be given to Unionists, or to prescribe a minimum wage.

In 1911 provision was made for statutory declarations in connection with any Commonwealth Act, Ordinance or Statutory regulation or in connection with the administration of any Commonwealth Department. The Commonwealth also agreed to accept the Petherick Collection of books, pamphlets, etc., dealing with the geography and history of Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. The President of the Arbitration Court is given greater powers to deal with the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes. Provision is made for the building of a railway from Kalgoorlie in Western Australia to Port Augusta in South Australia. The rates of postage in favour of Australian books and magazines was altered, and power is given to the Postmaster-General to acquire private telephone lines. The public servants of the Commonwealth are given the power to resort to the Arbitration Court for the settlement of claims relating to salaries, wages, rates of pay, or terms or conditions of service or employment of members of public service associations. Compensation to seamen
in respect of injuries in the course of their employment is provided for. Power is given to the Commonwealth to acquire and control lighthouses. Minor amendments were made in the Defence and Naval Defence Acts. Under the amending Electoral Act postal voting is abolished and provision is made for signature of articles issued during an electoral campaign and for the return of wages expended by organisations in an electoral campaign. Provision is made for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank and for the issue of inscribed Stock. Certain anomalies in the tariff are rectified. The gold reserve under the Australian Notes Act is altered to one-fourth of the amount of notes issued. The construction of the portion of the Pacific Cable between New Zealand and Australia is sanctioned. The Public Service Act is amended by making more liberal provisions in respect of payments in lieu of furlough on retirement or death.

The legislation of 1912 includes an amplification and extension of the powers of Royal Commissions. The number of justices of the High Court is increased by two, the Bench now consisting of the Chief Justice and six justices, all of whom must adjudicate upon questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. Under the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution (see page 4, supra), an Inter-State Commission is instituted. The Commission consists of three members, and is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and common seal, &c. A Directorship of Quarantine is instituted, and the scope of quarantine considerably extended. Medical examination of intending immigrants as to physical and mental fitness is prescribed, and immigration of undesirables is further restricted. Permanent incapacity through blindness and certain other causes entitles the sufferers to invalid pensions. Maternity allowance of £5 was instituted. Injuries to seamen and to manual and clerical employees of the Commonwealth must be compensated at rates laid down. Bounties on wood pulp and rock phosphate, and rewards for the discovery of rock phosphate are provided. Bounties payable under the various Acts may be withheld from claimants where the conditions of employment and rates of wages are below the standard declared by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The Sugar Excise and Sugar Bounty are repealed. (Note.—It was indicated that the Government of Queensland would deal with the matter.) The survey of a railway route from Pine Creek to Katherine River (Northern Territory) is authorised. The electoral machinery is extended to cover the taking of a referendum. Designs and trade marks legislation is extended to Papua. The British Copyright Act, modified to suit local circumstances, is adopted, and machinery for registration is instituted. Financial assistance is rendered to Tasmania by a grant of £500,000, payment being spread over ten years. Arrangements are made for the reduction of the British-Australian Squadron, and the consequent reduction of the naval subsidy. The method of prosecution of delinquents and the enforcement of penalties under the Defence Act are simplified, and the prescried training of junior cadets is reduced by one-fourth.

By the legislation of 1913, the relations of service between owners and masters of vessels and their crews are regulated by provisions for the health, protection, and welfare of the seamen. Sugar excise and bounty are fixed. Norfolk Island is accepted as a Commonwealth Territory. Extension of the Northern Territory Railway is authorised. Transmission of letter-telegrams is instituted. Provision is made for payment in respect to judgments against the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom. Joint Parliamentary Committees of public accounts and of Commonwealth public works are established—the former to examine and make recommendations to Parliament in regard to public accounts, the latter to consider and report upon the larger public works proposed. Further financial assistance is rendered to Tasmania by a grant of 400,000l. The raising of 2,780,000l. on loan for certain prescribed purposes is authorised.

In 1914, many new measures were enacted. Trading with the enemy is restricted. Documents may be impounded and controllers appointed for enemy firms and companies. Exportation of goods may be prohibited. The issue of Treasury bills is authorised. Duties are imposed on estates of deceased persons, and landed estates are further taxed. A war loan from the Imperial Government is authorised. War pensions are arranged. A grant of 100,000l. is made in aid of the Belgian Government. Machinery for detection of crimes, and for apprehension, indictment, and punishment of offenders, is provided, special prominence being given to offences in connection with the defence and safety of the Empire. (In 1915 it was enacted that this statute should continue in force during the continuance of the war and for six months thereafter, and no longer.) Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction is conferred on the High Court. The Commonwealth Bank is authorised to take over business of other banks. Manufacture of pig-iron from Australian ore is encouraged by the provision of a bounty.

Further war measures are the chief features of the legislation of 1915. A Ministry of State for the Navy is created, salary being provided by the addition of 1,650l. to the 12,000l. annually appropriated for salaries of Ministers. Taking of a war census is prescribed. A war loan of 20,000,000l. is authorised. An income tax is imposed. Lighthouses may be acquired by compulsory process from States not agreeing to transfer them. Acceptance of Jervis Bay Territory (Naval College) is arranged. Voting at referendums is made compulsory. Trial by jury is prescribed for indictable offences. The Murray Waters agreement is ratified. A further war loan of 18,000,000l. is authorised.

During 1916, further war measures are passed. Authority is given to raise 50,000,000l. for war purposes, and to borrow 25,000,000l. from the United Kingdom. The War Pensions' Act is amended, and the Trading with the Enemy Acts also amended.

The necessary appropriations have also been made by the Parliament for the services of the various years.

Commonwealth Departments.

The Customs and Excise Departments of the States were transferred to the Commonwealth Government on the 1st of January, 1901, and the Defence and Post and Telegraph Departments on the 1st of March, 1901. Other departments which have been created are those of External Affairs, Home Affairs, the Attorney-General's Department, the Treasury, and the Prime Minister's Department.

Public Debt of Australia 30th June, 1915.

The referendum of 13th April, 1910, gave power to the Commonwealth, at any time to assume all the State debts existing at that time. The distinction which formerly existed between the debts which could be taken over under the Constitution, and those which could not, consequently exists no longer. The following table shows the complete indebtedness of the States and Commonwealth at 30th June, 1915. In addition to the amount shown below, the Commonwealth owes £10,777,161 (included in the State debts) being the value of properties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth.
