ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is the largest Caroline island on the African coast, being 48 miles long by 15 broad, and having an area of 640 square miles. To the north east at a distance of some thirty miles lies the island of Pemba in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 40 miles long by 10 broad, and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The annual rainfall amounts approximately in Zanzibar to 58 inches and in Pemba to 83 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined: the heavy rains occur in April previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The thermometer ranges from 77° to 90° with a minimum of 80°. The climatic conditions though trying in the hot season which lasts from November to March are not necessarily unfavourable to Europeans provided that periods of residence are limited to terms of from twenty to thirty months.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors and are the principal landowners of the islands. The conditions of life in a malarious and tropical country have deprived them of much of the vigorous temperament which distinguished their ancestors, and the stoppage of the supply of slaves has left many of them almost without any resources. Nevertheless, though shaken by the ordeal through which they have passed, they still possess most of the land, and carry on the clove growing industry for which the two islands are famous. They understand the natives, and the natives understand them and accept their control more readily than that of any other race, except Europeans.

The bulk of the Zanzibar population consists of representatives of all the tribes of East Africa, intermingled with an Asiatic element. The name given to this mixed population is Swahili, a term formerly used to note the coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "kahl" in Arabic meaning coast.

The descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern portion of the island and especially on the east coast. They are the principal cattle breeders of the island. An Mhadimu is literally a servant, a term bestowed by the northern tribes when they conquered the country.

The natives of Pemba are known as Wapemba; they do not live in such seclusion as the Wahadimu on the larger island, but intermingle more freely with the Arabs and Swahili.

Khojas, Bohoras, Hindoos, Parsees, Goanese possess most of the trade of Zanzibar either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders or skilled mechanics. Goanese keep the European stores and provide both cooks and dhobis. They and the Parsees are also employed largely as clerks.

There is a considerable contingent of natives of German East Africa and of the Comoro islands who have settled in Zanzibar and with the northeast monsoon arrive numbers of Somalis, Shihiri Arabs and Baluchis in dhows laden with the products of their countries. These people usually return with the south-west monsoon, but a few remain and settle permanently.

History.

The early history of Zanzibar is chiefly a record of petty feuds and complicated quarrels. The so-called "Zenj Empire" was already declining when the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral towards the close of the fifteenth century. It was during the sixteenth that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by making the island his permanent residence and by encouraging the cultivation of cloves. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "all Africa as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghai Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000/. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000/.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the Imperial Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913,
the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

**Industries and Trade.**

The clove industry is by far the most important in the Protectorate, the Islands of Zanzibar and Pemba yielding the bulk of the world's supply. The clove was first introduced into Zanzibar from Réunion in 1818, and Sir Richard Burton remarks that as early as 1835 it had "almost supplanted the vulgar valuable coconut and the homely rice necessary for local consumption." He advised the Arabs of Zanzibar to follow the example of Mauritius and to give up cloves in favour of sugar. Colonel Rigby wrote in 1860:—"Were the prosperity of the Zanzibar Dominions dependent upon these degenerated Arabs it might well be despised of," and complained of their lack of initiative in refusing to cultivate anything else. In spite of advice, however, and notwithstanding disasters, the hurricane of 1872, which devastated the main island, cutting off every clove and coconut tree, and the smallpox epidemic of 1898, which decimated the population—the Arabs clung to their cloves, and, by thus concentrating on one product, "surpassing all plants in value," to quote Lord Acton, have given Zanzibar a position on the world's market which she would probably never have attained had her energies been dissipated over a large variety. It is estimated that there are in both Islands about 60,000 acres under cloves and about 50 million trees in bearing. The output varies considerably, the trees yielding heavy crops every three to five years: the average output of recent years has been about 14 million lbs. The large plantations are chiefly owned by Arabs, but many natives possess small holdings.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 40,000 acres under cultivation and 24 million trees in both Islands. The export of copra, which is steadily increasing, amounted in 1915 to 10,286 tons. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Cochin and Ceylon.

The principal export besides cloves and copra is chillies; re-exports, gum copal, hides and skins, ivory and rubber.

The chief imports are piece-goods, rice, various grains and petroleum.

**Currency and Banking.**

Gold coins, whether coined at the Royal Mint in England or at any Mint established as a branch of that Mint, are legal tender in payment or on account at the rate of 15 rupees to the £. The silver rupee of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, is the standard coin of Zanzibar. All other silver coins of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. These coins are \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \) and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a rupee. Seyyidieh copper piec are legal tender at the rate of 64 piec to 1 rupee for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. There is a Government note issue of the denominations Rupees 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100.

The only bank operating in Zanzibar is a branch of the National Bank of India, Ltd.

**Shipping and Communications.**

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend to indicate that the Island will continue, by reason of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic.

The British India Steam Navigation Company and the Union Castle Steamship Company maintain monthly services between London—Zanzibar—Durban and Southampton—Zanzibar—Durban respectively, the Clan-Ellerman-Harrison Line between Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), and the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes between Marseilles—Zanzibar—Madagascar. The British India Steam Navigation Company also maintain a service twice a month between Bombay—Zanzibar—Durban, and there are local services between Zanzibar—Mombasa—Aden and the Benadir Coast. The Government possesses two steamers which maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba.

There is cable communication with Europe either via Aden or via Durban.

There are 75 miles of roads throughout the Island of Zanzibar suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations in Zanzibar and Pemba and a telephone system in the town of Zanzibar which is connected with the District and Agricultural Stations in the country. A light railway runs north from the town to Bububu, 7 miles distant.

There are 7 post offices in both Islands.

**Constitution and Government.**

The Government is administered by a High Commissioner and a British Resident, who are appointed by commissions under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercise their functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1914.

Legislation consists of certain British and Indian Statutes, and also of Decrees of His Highness the Sultan, which latter are binding on all persons when countersigned by the British Resident under the Order in Council.

There is a Council for the Protectorate which exercises functions of an advisory and consultative nature and consists of His Highness the Sultan as President, the British Resident as Vice-President, and three official and three unofficial members.

Justice is administered in His Britannic Majesty's Court for Zanzibar and in the Court for Zanzibar and Pemba, the former exercising jurisdiction over British and foreign subjects and in all cases in which one of the parties is a British or foreign subject, and the latter over subjects of His Highness the Sultan. Appeals from His Britannic Majesty's Court for Zanzibar lie to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa.
