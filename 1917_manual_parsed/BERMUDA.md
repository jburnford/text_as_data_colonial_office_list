BERMUDA.

Situation and Area.

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group or cluster of about 30 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 32° 15' N., and long. 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American Continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730, from New York 677, and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles. The total area is estimated at 19 square miles (less than one-eighth of Rutland).

History.

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, after whom they were called The Bermudas. The Spaniards, however, took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers' ship, The Sea Venture, while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the Admiral's ship, The Sea Venture Flat.

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudez, called the group after him, "The Somers' Islands." The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land, taken home by Somers' nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their Charter, so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I., but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of 2,000l. to a new body of adventurers, called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands," and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the Admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers.

General Description.

The Bermudas, of which a good account will be found in the narrative of the voyage of the Challenger, may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sandhills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 3 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern, and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. The largest island, generally known as The Main Island, is about 14 miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands taken together measure about 3,000 acres. The city of Hamilton, now the seat of Government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the vessels which carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the Colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of Government to Hamilton, is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, entirely given up for the accommodation of His Majesty's Dockyard and a number of other naval establishments; Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, and now exclusively occupied by military depots and garrisons; Somerset, Smith's, St. David's, Cooper's, Nonsuch, Rivers, Ports, and Godets—all inhabited by a civil population. The islands form an almost continuous chain, and there is uninterrupted communication by roads and bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset, and over Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island—a distance of about 22 miles.

A little over a third of the inhabitants are of English descent, the remainder belonging to the negro race. English is universally spoken.

The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The rainfall in 1915 was 61'08 inches, as against 61'60 in 1914, and
49°98 in 1913, equivalent to an increase of 6°63 per cent. on the decimal average for 1905-1914, namely 54°45 inches. There is no winter, the thermometer never falling below 40 deg. of Fahr., and the summers are never very hot, the thermometer rarely rising above 85 deg. The summer heat, too, is generally tempered by a pleasant sea breeze.

A number of Boer prisoners of war were confined in the Colony during the South African War (1899-1902).

In 1914 the Legislature voted the sum of 51,750£, payable in fifteen yearly instalments, as a contribution to the Imperial Treasury in aid of the war fund.

The state of the Colony's finances did not admit of an immediate cash contribution and these annual payments represent a lump sum of the present value of 40,000£.

Trade and Agriculture.

In former days the inhabitants of Bermuda gave themselves up almost entirely to maritime pursuits. Numerous small vessels, of from 200 to 300 tons burthen, built by the islanders themselves, of their native cedar, traded between the West Indies and Demerara, and the United States, and the British colonies of North America. Later they extended their voyages, carrying the salt fish of Newfoundland to Italy and Portugal, and taking back the Port wine for which Newfoundland became celebrated, or running down to Madeira or Ascension to meet the homeward-bound Indian fleet, and taking back cargoes of tea or other Indian and Chinese products to be distributed along the American seaboard.

The repeal of the British navigation laws, the introduction of steam, and the very general substitution of iron for wooden ships, gradually destroyed the carrying trade which had been so profitable to Bermuda, and now the maritime fleet may be said to have ceased to exist, and the industry of the islanders is entirely confined to mercantile pursuits and to turning to account the small quantity of agricultural land which they possess.

The soil of Bermuda is generally poor in quality, and three-fourths of the area is quite unfit for cultivation.

But the climate, combined with the geographical position of these islands, in some measure compensates for the smallness of the area of fertile ground. There being nothing to fear from winter frosts, the ground can be sown and planted at any time from the end of August to the end of March, and the crops can be gathered and shipped off to New York in the months of March, April, May, and June, when the corresponding American produce has as yet scarcely shown itself above ground, and the Bermudians, taking advantage of this, raise large crops of early potatoes, onions, and lily bulbs, tomatoes and other vegetables, with which they keep the New York market supplied at a time when those vegetables cannot be obtained from any other quarter. Small quantities of arrowroot and cut flowers are also exported. Practically the whole of the exports go to the United States, which also supplies two-thirds of the imports, the remainder coming from the United Kingdom and Canada.

Very little use is made of the soil in Bermuda after the spring crops have been grown; a few melons, pumpkins, or sweet potatoes may be raised here and there, but by far the greater part of the ground is allowed to remain idle during the hot summer months; anything that could then be grown in Bermuda can be imported so much more cheaply from America, that it never pays to produce it. Very little also of the spring produce of the islands is consumed by the inhabitants—it is too costly; nearly all the early vegetables raised in Bermuda are exported, and the whole population, civil and military, depends for its subsistence upon food supplies obtained from abroad. All the flour, grain and meat, and nearly all the vegetables consumed in the islands, are imported from Canada and the United States, and all the food, furniture, clothing, horses, and cattle are brought from those or other quarters. Of late years the Islands of Bermuda have become a favourite winter resort for Americans and Canadians seeking to escape the rigours of the climate of the continent. Large hotels have sprung up, and a considerable amount of money is expended by the visitors.

During the year ending 31st December, 1915, over 10,000 persons, American and Canadian, visited the Colony.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. There are two incorporated banks, the Bank of Bermuda, Limited, and the Bank of N. T. Butterfield & Son, Limited, and several of the leading merchants do a considerable amount of business as private bankers and agents. A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and there are branches at Hamilton, St. George's, and Sandy's Parish. The number of depositors at the end of 1915 was 2,193, the total amount of deposits 43,288£.

Education.

In 1839 the Colonial Legislature first granted a sum of money to aid elementary schools.

The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of ten members appointed by the Governor under the provisions of the Schools Act, 1907.

All the schools are private schools, charging fees. Attendance is compulsory, and there were, in 1915, 29 aided schools with about 2,000 scholars.

There are, in addition, about 25 schools which receive no State aid.

In August, 1905, the Legislature established an annual scholarship of 150£., tenable by youths, natives of Bermuda, for two years at some educational institution abroad to be approved by the Governor, with a view to assisting youths to prepare to compete for the Rhodes' Scholarship awarded to Bermuda.

Means of Communication.

Telegraphic communication with the United Kingdom has been secured by the laying of a cable between the Islands and Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Rates to Halifax, 1s. 4d. per word.

,, England, 2s. 6d. ,,
Steamship Company, Ltd., sailing at 7-day intervals during the winter months and 10-day intervals in the summer.

Four Contract steamers carrying passengers and freight between Nova Scotia and the West Indies also call at Bermuda on their Northward and Southward voyages.

Letters from England usually take twelve days.

Internal Communications.

There are no railways in the Colony. There are approximately 100 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads. There is a private telephone company, which has about 775 subscribers and about 1,000 miles of wire in line.

Government and Constitution.

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermudian Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the Governors have always been appointed by the Crown, and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council, and the House of Assembly. The session lasts usually from November to June.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, consisting at present of four official and two unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. The members of Executive Council and of the Legislature are paid 8s. a day for each day's attendance. There are 1,303 electors, the electoral qualifications being the possession of freehold property of not less than 60l. value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property rated at 240l.

Local Government.

Hamilton and St. George have been incorporated since 1793 and 1797 respectively, and there are nine parish vestries, all the members of which, as well as of the two town corporations, are elected annually.
