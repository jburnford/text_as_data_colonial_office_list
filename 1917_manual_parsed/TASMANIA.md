TASMANIA.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide, the important colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 33' and 43° 39' S. lat., and 144° 39' and 148° 23' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British possessions, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian States.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1915 the highest shade temperature recorded was 61° 7" and the lowest 46° 7". The mean range for the year was 54° 2". In 1915 rain fell on 198 days in the year, and the rainfall was a little more than 20° 91 inches, the year being a very dry one throughout the island.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 2,806 miles of telegraph (with 4,374 miles of wire, including 408 of railway wires) open in the State. This includes 432 miles of cable belonging to the Commonwealth Government. The total cost of telegraph and telephone construction up to 30th June, 1915, was 444,608£., the receipts for telegraphs in 1914-15 being 23,814£. Construction including railway telegraphs and telephones, 1915, 462,115£. There are also 11,201 (wire) miles of telephone. Revenue in 1915-6, 28,600£.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The number of messages received and despatched in 1915 was 746,017.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Launceston three times a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney twice a week. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and Melbourne, and Hobart and New Zealand every week. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamers from Sydney calling for fruit, also carry passengers. The steamer with mails from Melbourne to Colombo and London every week; time 32 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 40 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Batavia, Aden, and Brindisi every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 55 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the steamers of the Shaw, Savile Co. and New Zealand Shipping Co., one vessel of each Company calling at Hobart every 2 weeks.

In addition to the above, mails are deposited by Messageries Maritimes de France and by German Line packets once a month.

There are 400 (in addition to 65 receiving offices) places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers |
|-----------------------------|
| Within Tasmania ... ... 1d. ... ½d. |
| Within Australasia ... ... 1d. ... ½d. |

Also to the United Kingdom, overseas dominions, British colonies and protectorates (except the New Hebrides) 1d. ... Europe, United States, etc. ... 1d. per 4 oz. and ½d. every additional 2 oz.

The number of letters and postcards and registered articles received and despatched in 1914 was 25,787,820; packets and newspapers, 12,419,223.

Area.

The State contains 26,215 square miles, the main island containing about 154 million acres of land, and the smaller islands connected with it 1¼ million acres; 6,351,121 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown, leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 8,581,974 (incl. lakes) acres (exclusive of 1,830,590 acres) which are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes, and 14,315 acres occupied by or reserved for State and Commonwealth Governments.

The adjacent islands are 50 in number, most of them being in Bass' Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, including Flinders Island, Robins Island, King Island, and Bruni and Maria Island on the east coast.

Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the State, and is maintained in fair order by the various municipalities. All the other main roads are under the control of municipalities, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local councillors, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the Treasury.

Railways.

There are now 725½ miles of railway in the State, constructed mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. Of these 725½ miles, 533 belong to Government, and cost 4,628,911£., and 192 miles to private companies, and cost 1,162,834£. The total cost of railway construction up to time of last balancing was 5,791,745£., the gross receipts in 1915 being 420,035£., and the working expenses 299,621£., showing a return in receipts over working expenses 120,414£.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; the upset price of second-class lands a sum not less than 10s. an acre; and of third-class land a minimum of 5s. per acre.

But a grant cannot be issued for the land unless improved to the extent of 1l. for every acre and resided upon for 5 years, inclusive of the 3 years' free occupation. Second-class lands must be improved to a value of 5s. per acre, and third-class lands to a value of 2s. 6d. per acre, before grant can issue therefor.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, copper, tin, wolfram, lead, hides, skins, and leather, hops, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark.

The land in crop on 1st March, 1916, was 333,334 acres and 675,335 acres permanently artificially sown grasses. There were in the State 169,675 horned cattle, and 1,624,450 sheep.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, which are now being turned to good account. Gold, silver, copper, tin, coal, wolfram, and also other minerals are found throughout the island. The principal goldfields are at Beaconsfield, Lefroy, and Mathinna. At Beaconsfield the Tasmania Mine is the main producer. Since the reef was discovered in 1877 up to 31st December, 1915, Tasmania mine has produced 841,244 ozs. of gold, and the total amount paid in dividends is 772,672l. At Lefroy several mines are sinking, driving, etc. Silver is found on the west and east coasts. Total quantity of silver lead ore produced during the year ending 31st December, 1915, amounted to 10,382 '96 tons, value 91,689l. Copper is also found, chiefly on the west coast, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company's mine being a large producer. This company has its own smelting and reduction plants, and for the year ending 31st December, 1915, produced 7,901 tons of blister copper, etc., value 742,312l. Tin is obtained in various parts of the island, the principal workings being at Mount Bischoff in the north-west and Brankholm and Mount Cameron in the north-east. The Mount Bischoff Company produced during the year ending 31st December, 1915, 479 tons, and paid in dividends 21,000l., making a total of 2,455,500l., distributed amongst the shareholders. 1915, total tin 2,600 tons, value 292,306l. Coal deposits exist more or less throughout the State, the principal mines being the Cornwall and Mount Nicholas in the north-eastern part. Output for the year ending 31st December, 1915, 64,536 tons, value 30,418l., at pit mouth. Osmiridium is found in the Wilson and Savage Rivers and their tributaries. During the year ending 31st December, 1915, 247 ozs. were obtained, value 1,581l.

Population.

The population in 1881 was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females.

On 5th April, 1891, the population of Tasmania was 146,667, of whom 77,560 were males, and 69,107 females, being 5'60 persons to the square mile.

On 31st March, 1901, the population was 172,475, of whom 89,624 were males, and 82,851 females.

The death-rate of 1904 was 11'04 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of inhabited houses not including tents (1,013) was 31,046. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds (157). On 3rd April, 1911, population, 97,591 male and 93,620 female = 191,211 persons.

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing within the Registration boundary an estimated population (31st December, 1915) of 39,838.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the State, contains within the Registration boundary an estimated population (31st December, 1915) of 24,661.

Local Government.

The original of this form of Government was superseded in 1907 by the "Local Government Act" which divided the State into 49 municipalities, exclusive of Hobart and Launceston (founded in 1865). The former 48 municipalities are made up of wards, each receiving its own representatives. The Presidents of the Councils are called wardens, and are elected annually. The functions of the old town boards, road trusts, etc., are now merged into the new municipalities. Every elector of the municipality who is a resident or has a place of business therein is eligible to be elected as a councillor for so long as he continues to reside or to have a place of business in the municipality. Every male or female of the age of 21 years whose name is on the assessment roll as the owner or occupier of any property within the municipality, is entitled to vote in the election of councillors. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, Table Cape, Leven, and Strahan, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards.

The total revenue from these local Government bodies was (Municipalities 370,196l., Marine Boards 65,398l.) 425,593l., including Government grants to Municipalities 14,416l. The total expenditure including expenditure from Loans (Municipalities 349,186l., Marine Boards 30,137l.) 379,323l.

The outstanding local debt at end of 1915 was about 1,677,345l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are seven banks established in the State—viz., The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, Bank of New South Wales, and Commonwealth Bank, with, together, 54 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1914, amounted to 4,943,583l., deposits 4,306,244l. The note circulation on same date amounted to 13,409l. (not including a Commonwealth note issue (422,841l.) held by Banks).
In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the State, established by Commonwealth Government in connection with the Post Office Department, total deposits at time of last balancing being 2,301,336l.

**Education.**

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1887 the board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a Director of Education, working under the Minister of Lands as Ministerial head. The system is free, national and compulsory, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 457 State schools in operation on 31st December, 1915, the number of scholars on the rolls 35,310, and the average attendance 22,581. In 1914, 25 State school scholarships (open to children under 13 years of age, from all schools) were in force.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and higher course of education amongst the youth of the State, the University of Tasmania was established in the year 1890, with power to grant scholarships and award degrees. In all eight scholarships are now awarded annually.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," and various amending Acts.

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as nine members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council nor any person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers) nor contractors to Government. The qualification for a member is to be 30 years of age, and to be a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 10l. or leasehold of 30l. annual value, or being a graduate of any University in the British Dominions, or Associate of Arts of Tasmania, or qualified legal or medical practitioner, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy, or retired officer of the Tasmanian Volunteer Force.

The House of Assembly consists of 30 members, elected for 5 electoral divisions. Any natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court, a person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers), nor a contractor to Government.

The duration of the Assembly is three years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to be a British subject, 21 years old, and resident for 12 months. The Franchise is extended to women. Voting by ballot is regulated by 1st Ed. VII., No. 57. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for about four months. Members, excepting Ministers and certain officers of Parliament, are paid 200l. Members of the Commonwealth Parliament are disqualified for a seat in either House, and a Minister of the Crown under the Commonwealth cannot hold a post as Minister in Tasmania.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.
