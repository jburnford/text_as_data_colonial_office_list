SWAZILAND.

Situation and Area.

Swaziland is bounded on the North, West, and South by the Transvaal, and on the East by Portuguese territory and Tongaland, now part of the Natal Province.

Its area is approximately 6,678 square miles.

Description and Climate.

The territory is divided geographically into three longitudinal regions.

The mountainous region on the West approximates an altitude of over 4,000 feet.

What is known as the Middle Veld is some 2,000 feet lower, while the Low Veld, bounded on the East by the Lebombo Mountains, attains an average altitude of not more than 1,000 feet.

The first two regions are well watered and healthy, but the Low Veld cannot be described as either.

Mbabane, the headquarters of the Administration, is situated on the hills at an altitude of 4,000 feet, and Bromersdorp, the old capital, is on the Middle Veld. There are no other European villages.

History.

Swaziland, known to the natives as "Kwangwane," has been in the occupation of the Swazi tribes for a considerable period, and the present Ama-Swazi are no doubt the descendants of the
early Bantu invaders, who occupied the country contemporaneously with the occupation of adjacent territory by allied tribes. The history of the consolidation into a nation of a congeries of tribes dates from early in the eighteenth century, when the adoption of a military organisation led to the dominance of one tribe over the others.

Certain "Medicine" and rain cattle were captured from Sikukuni by the Swazis, who lent assistance in the operations against that chief in the time of the first British occupation of the Transvaal, and the possession of this rain medicine has invested the paramount chief of Swaziland, in the minds of the natives of South Africa, with high authority as a rain maker.

The Swazis, while strong enough to repel a Zulu invasion, were nevertheless subject to the aggression of these neighbours, who, with the Boers, claimed authority over the country. In the Conventions of Pretoria (1881), and London (1884) Her Majesty's Government, however, expressly stipulated for the independence of Swaziland.

During the 'eighties the King "Mbandini" in return for money and other payments granted concessions for various periods. Every conceivable right was granted away, not only for land, minerals, grazing, and timber, but also for all imaginable purposes, including exemption from taxes, railways, telegraphs, mining patents, collection of the King's revenue, trading, etc., etc. All unallotted lands and minerals also formed the subject of concessions.

In 1888 a charter of self-government was granted to the whites in the country. Later, in 1890, under a Convention between Her Majesty's Government and the South African Republic, a provisional Government was, with the consent of the Swazis, set up, consisting of a Government Committee composed of representatives of those two Powers, and a representative of the Swazis, a Government Secretary, and of a Chief Court. This Court adjudicated on the initial validity of all concessions granted by the King, and, with few exceptions, confirmed the grants in respect of such initial validity.

In accordance with pledges given to the Government of the South African Republic the provisional Administration came to an end three years later, when the British Government signed a fresh Convention, which permitted the South African Republic to acquire from the Regent and her Council an Organic Proclamation conferring on the South African Republic rights of jurisdiction, legislation and administration without incorporation in the South African Republic. The Swazis never signed the Organic Proclamation which had been drafted for them, and accordingly its provisions, with some of those in the 1893 Convention, were embodied in the final Convention of 1894, under which the South African Republic exercised powers of protection, legislation, jurisdiction and administration in Swaziland, subject to the limitations of the Convention.

On the conquest of the Transvaal, all the rights and powers of the late South African Republic passed to His Majesty, but since the other party to the Convention of 1894 had disappeared without the limitations therein, an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act was issued in June, 1903, providing that the Governor of the Transvaal should administer Swaziland, and conferring on him the right to legislate by Proclamation.

On the cessation of hostilities a British Special Commissioner, with a small force of South African Constabulary, was sent into the country, and a provisional Administration was established.

In accordance with the powers granted to him, the Governor issued a Proclamation in 1904 providing for administration and for dealing with the concessions question. The Laws of the Transvaal in force at that date of the Proclamation were applied to Swaziland, mutatis mutandis. Courts were established with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the Transvaal, and an appeal was permitted from the decisions of the chiefs in civil matters to the Court of the Resident Magistrate. The chiefs were otherwise confirmed in their civil jurisdiction over natives, subject to the exclusion of usages incompatible with the due exercise of His Majesty's power and jurisdiction, or clearly injurious to the welfare of the natives.

The Commission constituted under the Proclamation of 1904 to deal with the concessions examined the concessions granting exclusive rights, except exclusive rights to land and minerals, with a view to their expropriation at their value prior to the commencement of hostilities. The Commission reported in 1906, and the concessions, the subject of its report, were, with a few exceptions, expropriated. The Commission subsequently dealt with the question of boundaries of land, mineral and grazing concessions. The general survey of these concessions, necessary to determine the conflicting rights, was also completed. The Proclamation of 1904 further provided for the settlement of the rights of the natives, which in a modified form, has been carried out.

By an Order in Council, dated 1st December, 1906, His Majesty's Government transferred the control of Swaziland from the Governor of the Transvaal to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Under the Order in Council the High Commissioner issued a Proclamation in March, 1907, providing for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, a Government Secretary, Assistant Commissioners and the establishment of a Police Force. The Laws of the Transvaal were re-enacted, mutatis mutandis, and, except where modified by Statute, the Roman-Dutch Common Law was put in force by the Proclamation. A special Court, having the full jurisdiction of a Superior Court, was established together with Courts of Assistant Commissioners with a limited jurisdiction.

The paramount chief and other chiefs were confirmed in their Civil Jurisdiction over natives subject to appeal to the Resident Commissioner. Provision was made for the Swaziland Deeds Office and Surveyor-General's Office to remain at Pretoria under control of the officers responsible prior to the date of the Proclamation.

Population.

The population of Swaziland, according to the census of 1911, was 1,083 whites and 98,876 coloured.

The Swazi are a kindred race to the Zulu. They have easily accessible markets for their labour, both locally and in the Transvaal, but their efforts in this direction are spasmodic, though large numbers have gone to work on the W. W. Rand Mines in recent years.

The paramount chief is "Sobhuza," a boy of about eighteen years of age. His grandmother,
"Nabotsibeni," widow of "Mbandini," acts as Regent, and has the assistance of a council of chiefs. A few of the principal chiefs are:

- Lomvanzi Dhlamini, son of Mbandini.
- Nogcogoo Dhlamini, brother of Mbandini.
- Jokovu Dhlamini.
- Nadabasezwe Dhlamini.
- Silele Nsibande.
- Makambane Fakude.
- Sibeleo Madhuli.
- Nshingili Simelana.
- Tikuba Dhlamini.

The Anglican Church, the Roman Catholic Church, The South Africa General Mission, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission, the African Methodist Episcopal Mission, the Wesleyan Methodist Mission, the Independent Methodist Mission, and the American International Holiness Union have representatives in the country.

The Administration has a native school at Zombodi, the kraal of the Regent, at which, until recently, the young paramount chief was educated. Sobhuza is now continuing his studies at the Lonsdale Institute in Cape Colony. The Government also maintains schools for European children at Mbabane, Bremersdorp, Ferreira's, Hluti, Mantambi, Driefontein, Mooihoek, and Nietgugund, and makes annual grants to the various native missions which undertake native education.

**Industries, Agriculture & Trade.**

Mining in Swaziland is carried on under the authority of Concessions granted by the late King Mbandini. Gold is worked at several Mines near the western border. Tin is found in payable quantities in the vicinity of Mbabane. The Crown owns a few mineral areas, some of which it is proposed to throw open to the public for prospecting and mining. The following is the output of tin and gold for the last two years.

| Year | Tin Output | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1914-15 | 496 tons | £43,256 |
| 1915-16 | 584 tons | £56,067 |

| Year | Gold Output | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| 1914-15 | 9,311 ounces | £39,552 |
| 1915-16 | 6,497 ounces | £29,595 |

The native crops consist of maize, millet, sweet potatoes, ground nuts, etc., grown in insufficient quantities to meet local demands. With the completion of the general survey of Concessions and the definition of rights a decided advance in farming by Europeans has taken place. The natives also are improving their methods of agriculture. The Government has imported a number of pure-bred bulls for use amongst the herds of natives' cattle. A marked improvement in the young stock is noticeable where these bulls have been stationed. The Government has disposed to farmers who will give beneficial occupation, numerous small blocks of Crown Land suitable for agricultural farming. Experiments have been conducted in cotton growing with encouraging results. Tobacco is grown in small quantities and has given a good return. The Government Horticulturist of the Transvaal has reported very favourably on the prospects of fruit growing. He was especially impressed with the suitability of the climate and soil for citrus fruits and mangoes.

There are approximately 100,000 head of horned stock, and 230,000 native sheep and goats in the territory. Cattle ranching on a large scale has been commenced by several companies formed for the purpose. Over 200,000 sheep (Merinos) are brought in each year from the high veld for winter grazing, but this class of sheep is not farmed in Swaziland during the summer months.

No statistics of the imports into and the exports from Swaziland are now kept. By an agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Swaziland is dealt with, for Customs purposes, as a part of the Union. Payments due to Swaziland are assessed on the proportions which the average of the collections for the three years ended March 31st, 1910, bear to the total customs collections of the Union in each year. The imports consist principally of maize, flour, groceries, wearing apparel, hardware, spirits, tobacco, and kaffir truck; while the principal exports are Cassiterite Tin and Raw Gold.

There is a branch of the National Bank of South Africa, Limited, at Mbabane, as also a Post Office Savings Bank. The currency is British.

Stores exist where necessary to serve the needs of the population, but the volume of trade is small.

**Revenue and Expenditure.**

The revenue and expenditure for the year ended March 31st, 1916, was:

- Revenue: £68,354
- Expenditure: £61,969

The public debt on March 31st, 1916, was £2,500.
