FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.
The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N. E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands, with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, in West Falkland, the highest ground in the Colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roche in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is at present the headquarters of eight whaling establishments. It is almost perpetually icebound, the snowstorms in the winter being numerous and exceedingly heavy. The island is mountainous (one of more than 5,000 ft. some probably higher) with inconsiderable lowland areas round the coast, divided by high ridges into small valleys, covered with tussock and luxurious vegetation. There are considerable areas of bog. The Swedish Antarctic Expedition visited the Islands in 1902, also the Scottish exploring vessel Scotia.

Among other Dependencies are the South Shetlands, Graham's Land, the South Orkneys (on which the Argentine Government have, with the permission of H.M. Government, established a meteorological station), and the Sandwich group.

History.
The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1764 they were taken possession of by France, and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1766. In the following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison, which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774, and no further formal occupation made till in 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1832 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the whale fishery. Until 1843 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty surveys. In 1843 a Civil Administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

On the 8th December, 1914, a naval battle was fought off the Falkland Islands, when a British squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir F. C. Doveton Sturdee, K.C.B., C.V.O., C.M.G., defeated and sunk a German squadron consisting of two armoured cruisers, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, two light cruisers, Leipzig and...
Nurnberg, and two transports. The light cruiser Dresden, of the German squadron, was subsequently sunk on the 5th March, 1915. There was no loss of ships on the British side, the only casualties being seven killed and twelve wounded.

On the 31st May, 1916, Sir Ernest Shackleton, with two members of the Imperial Trans-antarctic Expedition (Captain Worsley and Petty Officer Crean), arrived unexpectedly at Stanley in a whale catcher. The "Endurance" had been crushed by the ice in the Weddell Sea on 27th October, 1915, and the whole of the expedition had managed to reach Elephant Island in April, 1916. Shackleton, leaving there 22 members of the expedition, had made his way with five companions in an open boat to South Georgia, a distance of about 1,000 miles. He himself, with Worsley and Crean had crossed the island on foot to the settlements on the northern coast, this being the first time South Georgia has been crossed.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 950. The houses are mostly of wood and iron, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house, but there are several small hotels and boarding houses affording fair accommodation. The general aspect of the town is scarcely in keeping with the substantial prosperity of the inhabitants. Stanley is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1915, eight vessels of a total tonnage of 863 tons. It has a fine inner and outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going through the Straits of Magellan.

The climate is severe but healthy, except for those predisposed to pulmonary affections. It is uniformly cold, the mean temperature being 42°. The thermometer ranges between 30° and 50° in winter, and between 40° and 65° in summer. The cold is intensified by constant high winds which prevail, especially in the summer, rising about 10 a.m., and falling away between 4 and 5 p.m. There is not so much rain as might be expected, the annual rainfall seldom exceeding 25 inches. In the summer the atmosphere is remarkably dry, and evaporation is rapid.

The entire country is wild moorland, interspersed with rocks and stone runs. Suitable building stone is found in different parts of the island, which are composed of Devonian and Gondwana formations. The soil is chiefly soft peat, and travelling is difficult. There are no roads except within the limits of Stanley, and communication is by sea or on horseback. The islands are so well adapted for sheep farming, that the entire acreage has been devoted to that industry. The tussock, which grows to the height of seven feet, and affords fattening food for cattle, has now disappeared from the East and West Falklands, but it still abounds on the smaller islands. Celery, scurvy grass and sorrel are very plentiful, besides a small plant called the tea plant, much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos. In November and December the ground is covered with a variety of sweet-scented flowers. The cultivation of fruit and vegetables is made difficult by the damp, cold nature of the soil and the prevalence of high winds. Trees are completely absent.

Mutton is bought for 3d., beef for 5d. per lb., fowls, 3s. each, eggs, when procurable, for 2½d. to 3d. Fresh milk is bought for 4½d. a pint in summer, but cannot be obtained in winter. Apples and oranges of an inferior sort, imported from Chili and Uruguay, fetch 2½d. each.

Industry.

The principal industries are sheep-farming and whaling, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Patagonia. There were, in 1915, about 3,545 horses, 7,828 cattle, 62 pigs and 689,904 sheep.

The chief exports are wool and whale oil. The other exports consist of sheep skins, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, tallow and guano. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general supplies, and ship's stores.

In the Dependencies the Whaling Industry has made great progress in recent years. During the season ended 30th September, 1915, 456,169 barrels of oil were obtained.

Education.

There is a Government school with 160 pupils, and a Roman Catholic school with 90. The attendance averages seventy-five per cent. of the number on the rolls. At Darwin, East Falkland, there is a small settlement where the Falkland Islands Company have a school with about 15 pupils. Seven travelling teachers are employed to instruct the children at the various sheep stations and at the scattered shepherd's houses; by the Government, two on the East Falkland and three on the West Falkland; by the Falkland Island Company Limited, two in the peninsula of Lafonia, East Falkland. The average number of children thus receiving instruction is, in normal times, nearly one hundred and fifty.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and local 5l., 1l., and 5s. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1883, a Government Savings Bank was established, in which, on 30th September, 1915, the deposits were 74,016l., belonging to 696 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company, Limited.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This, however, was not found profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 97,128 acres purchased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, which occasionally call at this port in distress. Its capital is 110,000l., all paid up, and very large dividends have been paid.

The company maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and contributes to the provision of a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every month. The Pacific Steam Navigation Company's Steamer calls at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao and on the return voyage, once every
The voyage between Stanley and London occupies 27 days. Postage to the United Kingdom, British Possessions, and Egypt, 1d. per 1 oz.; to elsewhere, 2½d. per 1 oz., and 1½d. for every additional oz., or fraction of an oz. There is an internal post, 1d. the oz. Parcel post to England, 1s. for 3 lbs., 2s. for 7 lbs., 3s. for 11 lbs.; internal parcel post, 4d. for 3 lbs., 8d. for 7 lbs., and 1s. for 11 lbs. A K.W. Marconi wireless station was completed at Stanley in September, 1912; communication via Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of from 500l. to 600l.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for five years.
