QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger passing Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, and embracing the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, terminates on the boundary of the Northern Territory, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coastline to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

Early History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters or ranchers, as they are termed in America, began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the time of the proclamation declaring the Colony distinct.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°2', the extreme range during 1915 being from 38°0' to 103°3'. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane was about 26 inches.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera, of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and continues its course northerly to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, and the reduced output of all primary products at that period resulted in general depression throughout the State.

Sugar growing is a very important industry. In 1915 there were 133,027 acres under cane, of which 94,450 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 1,152,516 tons of cane, which produced 140,496 tons of sugar at 94½ net litre.

Maize was grown on 140,474 acres, and returned a yield of 2,003,463 bushels, but the local demand is so great that practically none is sent out of the State.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1915, 469 acres yielded 231,062 lbs. of cured leaf.

In 1915 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 284 acres, which yielded 2,123 tons of tuber. A small proportion of this root is utilised for pig food.

"Outside Australia there are restrictions as to the term 'Arrowroot.' Although it is admitted that the product in Queensland—derived from 'Canna Edulis,' having been acquired by virtue of many years of trading, dealing with the product of another plant, namely 'Maranta Arundinacea,' the Queensland produce has been practically prevented from entering the English market without such qualifications on the package as would prevent sale and exportation outside the Commonwealth."
Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, sparsely timbered but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, most of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. There is every prospect of the area of cultivation extending to the Burnett District and further west in the near future. In 1915, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 14,003 acres were mown for hay, and 93,763 acres yielded 414,438 bushels of grain, 98,958 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,973 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 223,896,160 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 106,177,791 acres are leased as grazing farms, homesteads, and under occupation licence.

The chief exports (1914-15) overseas of home production were: Wool, valued at £4,393,185.; gold, £38,151.; live stock, £233,681.; tin, £22,737.; meat (including bacon, hams, pork, etc.), and extract, £5,545,079.; hides and skins, £610,582.; tallow, £559,459.; fruit and vegetables, green and preserved, £932.; copper, £393,258.; butter, cheese and milk, £829,765.; pearl-shell and tortoise-shell, £15,367.; timber, £3,870.; marsupial skins, £2,364.; fish and oysters, £33,973.; silver, £5,286.; hoof, horns, bones and hair, £29,813.; manures, £6,500. Goods sent to other States of Australia are not now counted as exports.

In some items the details given are of practically no value. Notably gold, green fruit, sugar, etc., and a goodly proportion of other primary products, which, being transhipped in other States, are not now counted to Queensland in official statements.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mount Morgan mine—Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-eight districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1915 amounted to 249,711 fine ozs.

Many other minerals are worked in the State. The principal of which and their value for 1915 were:

- **Tin.**—£183,472.; the chief centres of production being Chillagoe, £26,181.; Cooktown, £30,170.; Herberton, £94,759.; Kangaroo Hills, £11,100.; and Stanthorpe, £17,847.
- **Silver.**—£23,972.; Charters Towers, £2,588.; Chillagoe, £3,377.; Cloncurry, £7,023.; Etheridge, £800.; Herberton, £2,260.; Mt. Morgan, £3,978.; Rockhampton, nil.; Stanthorpe, nil., and Croydon, £1,385.
- **Copper.**—£428,793.; Chillagoe, £42,678.; Cloncurry, £718,796.; Etheridge, £1,324.; Gladstone, £48,980.; Herberton, £13,929.; Mt. Morgan, £581,739.; Mt. Perry, £18,396.; Rockhampton, nil.; MacKay, £1,584.
- **Wolfram and Bismuth.**—£81,075.; Chillagoe, £25,568.; Herberton, £27,316. Besides these lead, manganese and other minerals, exclusive of coal, aggregating £88,844. were obtained.
- **Molybdenite.**—£45,060.; Chillagoe, £43,102.

Total value of minerals other than gold, £2,261,658. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1915 being of the value of £500.† whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems to the value of £600.† were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burram and Peak Downs, the Dawson Valley and the Darling Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1915 was 1,024,273 tons, valued at £409,342.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the State is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbutt, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, crows ash, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Bean tree, Kauri pine, Cypress pine, She pine, silky oak, satin wood, maple, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—

- **Duboisia myoporoides**, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna;
- **Austonia constricta**, whose bark is a valuable tonic;
- **Euphorbia Drummondii**, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever;
- **Euphorbia pilulifera**, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1914, 291 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 21,321.

**Water Supply.**

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State,

† Owing to the War gems and opal were practically unsaleable.
of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1915 an indebtedness to the Government of £1,797,318.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 670,500 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 2,448 artesian bores have been sunk with an aggregate depth of 471 miles; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,045 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimera Run; 1,027 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 480,484,600 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 270 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 210° to 81° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at about three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, so that not far short of a million sterling represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the State, and owing to the unfavourable season 11,842 acres were artificially watered last year. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51.29 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females. The census of 3rd April, 1911, showed that there were 329,506 males and 276,307 females, making a total of 605,813, exclusive of 8,687 aborigines. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1911 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions.

Practically the whole of the State is divided into local authority areas a few islands only being excluded, occupied by a population of about 1,500 persons. The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1915 were £2,727,933.; their expenditure £2,926,153.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control £61,919,200l.; excluding cost of construction of waterworks (£2,687,183l.), and liabilities £5,019,946l. Liabilities for water works, amounting to £1,643,064l., which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given; assets, £6,709,203l.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on 31st December, 1915, an estimated population of 161,938 (ten mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (13,835), Ipswich (25,000), Maryborough (11,626), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (20,915), Gympie (12,419), Toowoomba (21,200), Charters Towers (17,298), Bundaberg (11,988), and M'Morgan (12,023). All these include an area of ten-mile radius, except Charters Towers which is for a five-mile radius. (Census 1911.)

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1915, 12 banks, with 337 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £3,342,332l.; deposits, £27,475,867l. The Government Savings Bank, on 30th June, 1916, with branches return the number of depositors as 204,233; the amount of deposits as £11,338,568l. Average value of each account 55l. 10s. 5d.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling. The Commonwealth has also silver coin in circulation and British coin is being gradually withdrawn, but some years will elapse before local coin is exclusively in use.

Means of Communication.

Queensland is divided for the purpose of Railway administration into three divisional railway systems, Southern, Central and Northern, in which on 30th June, 1916, there were altogether 4,967 miles of Government Railways open for traffic, being the longest mileage of open Railway in any Australian State, and 440 miles of Railways and Tramways of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge owned by private companies or Local Authorities and which are either worked by or under the Commissioner's inspection. On 1st Sept., 1916, there were 491 miles of Railway under construction, and 1,564 authorised by Parliament but not yet commenced.

The Central and Northern Divisions are each in charge of Deputy Commissioners, subject to the control of the Commissioner at Brisbane. This policy of decentralisation of the railway management of the State was given effect to in July, 1915.

From Brisbane main trunk lines run west and north. The former crosses the Main Range (2,000 ft. high) and shortly after passing Toowoomba at the entrance to the Darling Downs, 101 miles from Brisbane, bifurcates, one arm proceeding due west through pastoral and wheat growing country until it reaches Cunnamulla (604 miles from Brisbane), the other crosses the Darling Downs and passing through the granite district in which are many flourishing fruit orchards, terminates at Wallan-Garra on the New South Wales border (223 miles from Brisbane). Here connection is given with the mail train services to the southern capitals. Off the western and southern Lines there are 14 Branches, with a total length of 688 miles, serving rich agricultural and pastoral districts, and when the construction of the
additional lines authorised into these areas is an accomplished fact a vast increase in staple products due to closer settlement will result.

Within a radius of 100 miles from Brisbane there are 13 branch lines of 394 miles in length serving the suburban areas, seaside resorts, and rich agricultural and heavily timbered districts. One of these lines running due south meets the New South Wales border at Tweed Heads, 69 miles from Brisbane.

The Northern Trunk Line after leaving Brisbane follows the coast line for 397 miles to Rockhampton, passing through the towns of Gympie, Maryborough and Bundaberg and giving connection at the ports of Gladstone and Port Alma with the steamer services to the northern ports of the State. Off the Trunk Line there are ten branches, totalling 480 miles in length, serving agricultural, mineral and sugar lands, and heavily timbered districts.

The Central Line extends from the town of Rockhampton due west to Longreach, 428 miles, passing through pastoral country, with 8 branches of 390 miles of line into agricultural, pastoral and mineral areas, and to the port of Broadmount on the Fitzroy River, some 36 miles below the city wharves. North from Rockhampton the railway has been extended to Kunwarara, a distance of 45 miles, and a further portion of this section of the North Coast Railway, which will, in time, link Cairns and Brisbane, is under construction to Marlborough.

From the port of Mackay, 540 miles north of Brisbane, a short Line runs through the sugar growing country east of the Bungella Range, with three small Branches running north and south, a distance of 28 miles, into sugar country. In this district there are over 200 miles of light tramways into the sugar plantations and mills. From Mackay southward the coastal line has been constructed for a distance of 36 miles to Koumala, and a further section of 25 miles is being built to Carmila Creek, whilst north from Mackay, a section of 31 miles to St. Helens is in hand.

From the port of Bowen 645 miles north of Brisbane, a Line runs northward for 120 miles through pastoral and sugar growing country to the port of Townsville, and a branch line three miles from Bowen, 39 miles in length, runs southward into the rich sugar land of Proserpine. Both Lines will eventually form a link in the North Coast Trunk Line.

The Great Northern Railway which commences at the port of Townsville, 748 miles north of Brisbane, runs west for 481 miles through the well known mining town of Charters Towers, 82 miles from the Port, and from Hughenden (236 miles) the Line runs due west for over 200 miles through Northern Downs, pastured with millions of sheep, to the rich copper mining district of Cloncurry, thence with a southerly sweep to Malbon, where it bifurcates to the mining districts of Hampden, Mt. Elliott and the Duchess. North from Cloncurry another line, 42 miles in length, has been built to Koolamarra, and a further extension of this to serve the Mt. Cuthbert Mineral District is under construction. At Hughenden a Line runs south-west to Winton, a distance of 132 miles, through fine pastoral country. At 54 miles from the Port another Branch runs south to the town of Ravenswood, until recently a flourishing mineral township; a portion of the Coastal Railway north of Townsville has been constructed.

In the far north over 906 miles from Brisbane from the port of Cairns, a line of Railway runs west over the Barron Ranges, past the famous Barron Falls, through some of the most picturesque tropical scenery in the world, through the wonderful timber scrubs of Atherton, the mineral township of Herberton, to the rich table land at the heads of the Herbert and Johnstone Rivers. A Branch Line joining the Main Line 64 miles from Cairns runs along the Johnstone River through rich scrub lands. At Mareeba, 46 miles from the Port, the private line of the Chillagoe Company junctions with the Cairns Railway. This private line runs to Mungana, a distance of 103 miles, and 75 miles from this junction another line 143 miles in length serves the rich mineral fields of the Etheridge, whilst from Dimbulah another line of 30 miles taps the coal fields of Mt. Mulligan.

From Cairns another railway runs southward along the coast for a distance of 42 miles, serving some of the richest sugar producing lands in Queensland. The extension of this Line will form another section of the Main North Coast Trunk Line.

From Cooktown, the furthest Northern port on the Eastern Coast, a railway runs to Laura, a distance of 67 miles.

From Normanton in the Gulf country a railway runs to the mineral town of Croydon, a distance of 94 miles.

The Lines under construction in Queensland embrace a comprehensive scheme of linking up the ports on the Pacific coast by railway, and the building of a transcontinental railway connecting the termini of the railway systems in the far west.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict., No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1915 there were in operation 1,463 State (including 6 high) Schools, with an enrolment of 126,319 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 147 private schools, with 16,946 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,574 pupils on the roll. A University is now established with 4 professors, 26 lecturers, etc., enrolment 253. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

Immigration.

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 131,003, and the departures to all countries 140,447, showing an excess of departures of 9,444 (including Expeditionary Forces).

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The Elections...
Act Amendment Act of 1905 provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only, a twelve months' continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 38 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act of 1910, the State is divided into 72 districts, each returning one member, or a total of 72 members as previously.
