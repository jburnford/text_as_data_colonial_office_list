WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, New South Wales, or New Zealand, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1907, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met partly from Imperial and partly from Protectorate funds.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of His Majesty's ships of war on the New Zealand station are appointed as occasion arises to be Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

PRINCIPAL GROUPS UNDER THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, are situated between the 20th and 23rd degrees of south latitude. The islands are most of them of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafoou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra (the dried kernel of the nut) forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group. There is regular steam communication with Auckland via Fiji (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles).

The late king, George Tubou, was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, and his rule on the whole was fairly successful. The king is assisted by a native parliament and a privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Treasury, Education, and Medical Departments, the whole of the Government officers are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of Fiji, and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades. The revenue and expenditure in 1914-15 amounted to £36,114 and £36,414 respectively. According to the official returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
|      | £ s. d. | £ s. d. |
| 1905 | 76,868 0 0 | 110,728 0 0 |
| 1906 | 79,363 0 0 | 137,683 0 0 |
| 1907 | 97,820 0 0 | 134,193 0 0 |
| 1908 | 98,650 0 0 | 133,756 0 0 |
| 1909 | 152,870 14 9 | 217,155 3 10 |
| 1910 | 160,543 9 11 | 245,946 7 3 |
| 1911 | 182,121 19 10 | 240,103 13 4 |
| 1912 | 169,472 0 0 | 216,511 0 0 |
| 1913 | 81,044 6 4 | 82,320 14 4 |
| 1914 | 87,702 0 0 | 73,036 0 0 |

but the value of the copra exported in the years previous to 1904 is about 20 per cent. too high. The shipping in 1914 amounted to—Entered, 57,474 tons; cleared, 54,099 tons. The native population at the end of 1914 was 23,121; the European about 600. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are five churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents; the "Free Church of England," founded by Mr. Shirley Baker, the number of whose adherents is unknown; and the Church of England recently established by Dr. Willis, late Anglican Bishop of Honolulu. The Free Church of Tonga was established in 1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakogo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Waldemar Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakogo," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church, whose houses were pillaged, and who were beaten with clubs and whips till they declared their adherence to the "Free Church." About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren inhospitable islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakogo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he, in accordance with the power conferred on the High Commissioner by the Western Pacific Orders in Council, issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make the necessary arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufahau, under the title of George Tubou II.

By the Convention of 14th November, 1899, Germany renounced all rights over Tonga Islands, including Vavau, and over Savage Island (Nieué).

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed by Mr. Thomson, in Tonga, and, by consent of the chiefs, in Savage Island also.

In December, 1904, and January, 1905, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard im Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder, and receiving an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him under the Treaty of 1890. The Premier, Jiosateki Toga Veikune, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jione Mateialona was appointed to the Premiership, which office he held until 30th September, 1912, when he resigned. Since that date the appointment has been held by Devita Bolutele Kaho, Tui Vakano. The progress of Tonga, since the appointment, in 1905, of Mateialona to the Premiership, has been satisfactory.
All the natives are taught to read and write, and higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British and foreign subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

The Union Group consists of three small islands, Fakaofo, Atafu, and Nukunono, about 9° S. latitude and 172° W. longitude, and is now included, for administrative purposes, in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. The islands are coral atolls, and the principal article of trade is copra. The natives are of Polynesian race, and are about 1,000 in number. They are ruled by their own chiefs, with the assistance of native councils. The inhabitants are either adherents of the London Missionary Society or Roman Catholics.

The Ellice and Gilbert Groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 5° N. latitude and 10° S. latitude, and 170° to 180° E. longitude. The principal export is copra. The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race, and number about 30,000, and are most of them now adherents either of American or British Nonconformist Missions, or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. The islands have separate kings or chiefs, who are assisted by councils of chiefs and commoners. These groups were formerly under British protection, but at the request of the natives, they were annexed to H.M.'s dominions in November, 1916, and are now included with Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands and the Union Group, on the Gilbert and Ellis Islands Colony. Courts of law have been established amongst the natives, and a revenue is obtained from native contributions and trade licences, which covers the cost of maintaining a regular government in the islands.

Ocean Island, or Paanopa, in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, was annexed and included in the jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Protectorate in 1900. It is now the site of most successful operations by the Pacific Phosphate Company, whose European employees there number about 80. The natives of the island, who are closely allied in race to the Gilbertines, numbered, in 1911, 486.

Revenue and expenditure of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony were as follows:

Revenue, 1910, 13,963l.; 1911, 21,331l.; 1912-13, 30,272l.; 1913-14, 42,791l.; 1914-15, 16,120l.; 11s. 2d.

Expenditure, 1910, 12,291l.; 1911, 17,965l.; 1912-13, 17,952l.; 1913-14, 21,615l.; 1914-15, 23,522l. 2s. 5d.

Exports in 1914 amounted to 349,250l., of which 213,250l. was the value of phosphates from Ocean Island, and 20,700l. of copra.

The total population of the Protectorate in 1912 was 31,133 (of whom 30,523 are natives) including 297 Europeans and 301 Asiatics.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ongtong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7½ and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. Stations have been established by the Melanesian Mission, and by the Roman Catholics, but the converts are not numerous. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 150,000, but is said to be decreasing, large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, but dysentery and fighting among its inhabitants has greatly reduced the numbers. The natives have been described as treacherous; some tribes are still head-hunters and cannibals. A large number of natives used to go under indenture to labour in Queensland, Fiji and Samoa. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation, however, as the internal demand for labour now exceeds the supply. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in March, 1914, amounted to 30,000 acres. The white population in 1914 numbered 660. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The British Resident Commissioner has his headquarters at Tulagi, a small island between Guadalcanar and Malaita, where there is a Customs House and Post Office. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, at Mala, and at Gizo. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales. By the convention between Great Britain and Germany on 14th November, 1899, Choiseul, Isabel, Shortland Island, and the islands lying in Bougainville Straits came within the British sphere.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1835, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia, the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois. In Grenada the same condition obtains, but to a less extent.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados and a common audit system instituted in 1889. There was also a common lunatic asylum, but St. Lucia has now a commodious asylum for the accommodation of her lunatics.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank" and "Royal Bank of Canada," which had branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at all of the Windward Islands. The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Port of Spain for the purpose of transhipping passengers, mails, and cargo from the transatlantic to the intercolonial steamers.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call fortnightly at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Trinidad Shipping and Trading Company, Grenada being the first and last port of call. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's Canadian line of steamers call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

* This itinerary is, in consequence of the war, not being adhered to at present.

and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by cable to Havana and Bermuda. The rate per word for telegrams to the United Kingdom from Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent is 2s. 6d. The rate to Europe varies from 2s. 9d. to 3s. 4½d. per word. (Government messages pay half rates). Government messages are always routed via Bermuda.
