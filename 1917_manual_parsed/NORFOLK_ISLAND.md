NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of three small islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 4' S. lat. and 167° 59' E. long., the other islets being Philip and Nepean Islands. They comprise altogether about 15 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there. This was removed in 1856, and in 1866 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 194 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The Pitcairn Islanders were the descendants of the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," who occupied Pitcairn in 1790, and were removed at their own request to Norfolk Island. Of these 40 returned to Pitcairn. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population at the census of 1911 was males 407, females 385. Melanesians, males 161, females 32, total 985. The chief occupation is agriculture, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The island was on the 24th June, 1856, placed under the control of the Governor of New South Wales, who was given power to appoint officers, make laws and grant lands. On 1st July, 1914, the island was made a territory of the Commonwealth. The office of the administration is the Department of External Affairs, Melbourne (Minister for External Affairs, Hon. Hugh Mahon, M.P., Secretary, Atlee Arthur Hunt, C.M.G.). It is a station of the Pacific Cable Board. Communication is maintained once every 5 weeks by steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free, and there is an efficient school which is conducted by a head master (Mr. Passmore) placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government by the Department of Public Instruction, New South Wales. The village is Kingston.
