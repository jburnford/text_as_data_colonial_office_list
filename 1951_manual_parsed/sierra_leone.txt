SIERRA LEONE

Situation and Area

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,925 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 55' and 10° N. latitude, and 10° 16' and 13° 18' W. longitude. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at 9° 2' on the border of French Guinea, to the Mano River at latitude 6° 55' N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The Colony portion of this area, i.e., the territories acquired by the Crown by treaty of cession or otherwise consists of the following:—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbro Island, the Tasso, Banana, Turtle, Plantain and York Islands and other small islets, the Bake Loke, Maforki and part of the Bure Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro-Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timdel, Bendu, Cha, Nonkoba Bullom, Messi Krim, and part of the Mano Sakrim Chiefdoms in the South Western Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasso Island, Banana Islands, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as if they were within the Protectorate.

Climate

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The shade temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 97°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur at the commencement and close of the rainy season. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The annual average rainfall in Freetown is 148 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from north-east to south-east.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is trying, but conditions have been greatly improved in recent years through the efforts of the medical and sanitary services, and if ordinary precautions are taken the risk of contracting malarial fever can be much reduced. In the Freetown area in particular the incidence of malaria has been greatly reduced as a result of control measures instituted during the recent war.

General Description

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of igneous mountains, running parallel to the sea from north-west to south-south-east, the summits of which, in the Picket Hill, Sugar Loaf and Leicester mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of norite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The coastal strip is flat and low-lying and the river estuaries, below high tide mark, are bounded by extensive mangrove swamps. The western and southern part of the Protectorate consists of rolling wooded country, broken in places by ranges of hills rising to 1,000 feet or more. The ground rises to the north and east to form an upland plateau having a general elevation of about 1,500 feet. The Sula and Kangari hills rise to nearly 3,000 feet, while to the east, near the French Guinea frontier, Bintimane peak and the summits of the Tingi range rise to above 6,000 feet. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa the country is well watered by rivers and streams. The principal rivers of Sierra Leone, which empty themselves into the Atlantic Ocean, are the Great and Little Scarcies, the Rokel or Seli (or Sierra Leone River), the Jong or Teye, the Ribbi, the Bum or Sewa, the Moa and the Mano, most of which are navigable by small craft for varying distances.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,900 feet above the sea. It possesses one of the best harbours in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining yield only a small quantity of exportable commodities. Some cassava is grown which is used for local consumption. Fruits and vegetables are also grown in the hilly valleys. The extent of the peninsula area is small (256 square miles), and the generally rocky soil is not well adapted for cultivation.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piaassa, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonthe in the South-Western Province as well as through Freetown.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, coconuts, beniseed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cocoa, rice and other tropical products.

The mineral industry which owes its inception to the discovery firstly of platinum in 1926 and later of other minerals by the Government Geological Survey, has been responsible for over 50 per cent. in value of the exports of the Colony and Protectorate since 1935. Diamonds are obtained from alluvial workings in the Kono
district, chromite is mined in the Kambui hills in the Kenema district and iron ore is extracted at Marampa in the Port Loko district. A large deposit of iron ore has also been proved in the Tonkolili district. The production of gold and platinum which decreased during the 1939-45 war is showing some signs of recovery.

All minerals are vested in the Crown except the deposits at Marampa which belong to the tribal authorities, who have leased them to the operating company.

The main tribes in the Protectorate are in the north, Temne, Limba, Susu, Loko, Fula, Mandingo, Koranko, Yalunka, and in the south Mende, Sherbro, Krim, Gallina, Gola, Vai Kono and Kissi.

### POPULATION

The estimated population of Sierra Leone at the last Census, held in 1947, was as follows:

| Colony | Protectorate | Total |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Europeans | 608 | 356 | 964 |
| Asiatics | 873 | 1,201 | 2,074 |
| African natives | 951,114 | 1,729,983 | 1,825,097 |
| African non-natives | 28,062 | 2,078 | 30,140 |

Total population | 124,657 | 1,733,618 | 1,858,275 |

| Male | 66,276 | 838,184 | 904,460 |
| Female | 58,381 | 895,434 | 953,815 |

### RELIGION

Most of the tribes of the Protectorate have come under the influence of Islam, particularly in the north. The Protectorate is, however, predominantly pagan. Christian missions work in all parts of the Protectorate but conversion to Christianity has not been on an extensive scale.

The Colony area is predominantly Christian. Sierra Leone is a diocese of the Church of England, and the Roman Catholic Mission constitutes a vicariate apostolic of the Roman Catholic Church. The most important Christian missions working in Sierra Leone are the Church Missionary Society, Methodist, Roman Catholic, United Brethren in Christ Mission and the American Wesleyan Mission.

### HISTORY

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 31st August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, from various circumstances, had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves, and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on 10th July, 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the treaty of cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

### CONSTITUTION

A charter, issued on 27th May, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A further charter, dated 19th February, 1866, established a central government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new charter, dated 24th July, 1874, revoked so much of the charter of 19th February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further charter, dated 17th December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the Officer Administering the Government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New Letters Patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By Letters Patent of 28th November, 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. By Letters Patent, dated 3rd April, 1913, and Royal Instructions, dated 4th May, 1922, there were constituted an Executive Council composed of the Officer in Command of the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and a Legislative Council, composed of the members of the Executive Council and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On 7th March, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Conventions, 11th November, 1885, and 21st January, 1911.
The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and give effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Letters Patent, dated 28th January, 1924, revoked those issued on 3rd April, 1913, and made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instructions issued under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet on the same date cancelled those of 3rd April, 1913, and 4th May, 1922. An Order of the King in Council, dated 16th January, 1924, provided for a new and considerably enlarged Legislative Council, introducing an elective element and direct representation of Protectorate interests into the constitution of that Council for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone.

Proposals for a revised constitution providing for a majority of non-official members and for a larger representation for the Protectorate have been under discussion by various interested parties since 1947, and were published as a Sessional Paper in 1948. Efforts to form a Representative Committee in 1949 to consider the proposals further proved fruitless and the Secretary of State has now approved the proposals, slightly amended, which were put forward in 1948. These have been published as Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1950.

**ADMINISTRATION**

**Colony**

That part of Sierra Leone which is administered as Colony consists of the Sierra Leone Peninsula with the adjacent Tasso and Bananas Islands, the town of Bonthe on Sherbro Island, and York Island. It is administered by three authorities:

(a) The Freetown City Council administers the city of Freetown. A new Freetown Municipality Ordinance was passed in May, 1948, and a reconstituted council took office on 1st November, 1948.

(b) The Rural Area Council which deals with the Colony Peninsula outside the Freetown Municipal Area.

This Council has superseded the original Rural Areas Council since the introduction of the Rural Area Ordinance of 1949; under this a three-tier organisation has been set up. At the lowest level elected Village Committees have been established for each village, which in turn elect representatives to the six Rural District Councils. The latter each elect one member to be their representative in the Rural Area Council. The President of this Council for the first three years is the Commissioner, Headquarters Judicial and Freetown Police Districts, after which period it is thought that the Rural Area Council will be sufficiently experienced to conduct its business under the presidency of one of its own members elected for the purpose.

(c) The Sherbro Judicial District, consisting of the town of Bonthe, York Island and the small islands adjacent thereto, is administered in the same way as the Headquarters District of the Colony. The District Commissioner of the Bonthe District (Protectorate) is ex-officio President of the Sherbro Judicial District Board, the local authority for the district. The Board consists of the President, the Medical Officer, Bonthe, and four unofficial members, of whom two are elected by adult male taxpayers, and two appointed by the Governor.

It is proposed to introduce a new administrative organisation for this area by the formation of a Sherbro District Council. This Council is intended to consist of eight members, consisting of two elected from each of three wards, one nominated by the Governor, and the Medical Officer of Bonthe. Members would elect a President from their number.

**Protectorate**

The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces, Northern, South-Western, and South-Eastern, each in charge of a Provincial Commissioner. Administrative control of the whole Protectorate is vested in the Chief Commissioner, whose headquarters are at Bo. During 1950 the policy of amalgamating smaller chiefdoms, whenever the people of such chiefdoms agree to such amalgamation, and creating organized local governments in the shape of Native Administrations wherever feasible, was continued. The number of Districts in the Northern Province was reduced from six to five for administrative convenience in 1949. There are therefore now 12 Protectorate Districts each in the charge of a District Commissioner, and 185 chiefdoms each ruled by a Paramount Chief. 142 chiefdoms, including all the larger ones and about 90 per cent. of the total population of the Protectorate, have been organized as Native Administrations since 1937. These Native Administrations have their own Treasuries, and are responsible, under the supervision of the District Commissioner, for local administration and development.

District Councils and a Protectorate Assembly (with advisory functions) were established in 1945. In 1950 the District Councils assumed responsibilities for plans of economic development, with financial assistance from the government.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Facilities for education were provided in the Colony throughout the nineteenth century by religious bodies with financial assistance from the Government. Primary instruction is now provided in "Amalgamated" Mission Schools, in private schools, and in one Government school. In the case of the "Amalgamated" schools, fees are paid into government revenue and salaries of teachers and cost of equipment are borne by public funds. There are one Government secondary school for boys, eight assisted secondary schools (four for boys, four for girls) and one unassisted secondary school for girls. Fourah Bay College is affiliated to Durham University and prepares students for degrees in Arts and Theology and for Teaching Diplomas. Arrangements have now been made for an enlarged Fourah Bay College, with University and Technical Departments to be administered by an independent Council (Ordinance No. 1 of 1950).

In the Protectorate, where education has developed more slowly, there are one Government secondary school for boys and one assisted secondary school for girls, a Government upper primary school for boys and one Government boys and girls school for upper primary pupils. The Government Secondary School at Bo is being enlarged to take 350 boys. With the exception of the mixed school these all have boarding facilities.
The two Southern Provinces have so far developed more quickly than the Northern, owing to easier lines of communication. Increasingly, Native Administrations are assisting development by the provision of primary schools with the assistance of Government grants towards payment of teachers' salaries. There are also three teacher training institutions controlled respectively by Government and by Protestant and Roman Catholic Missions.

The number of Government and Government assisted schools at the end of 1949 was as follows:

| Colony          | Schools | Pupils |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Primary         | 52      | 9,200  |
| Secondary       | 9       | 2,017  |
| Teacher Training| 2       | 61     |
| **Total**       | **63**  | **11,278** |

| Protectorate    |         |        |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Primary         | 114     | 14,082 |
| Secondary       | 2       | 304    |
| Teacher Training| 3       | 84     |
| **Total**       | **119** | **14,470** |

In addition there are 99 privately owned and unassisted Mission Primary Schools in Sierra Leone, attended by 8,087 pupils. Thus the total number of institutions is 281 with a total roll of 33,835 pupils at the end of 1949.

**Information Services**

The Public Relations Department is responsible for diffusing information, maintaining good relations with the local Press, and maintaining close liaison with the Colonial Office Information Department.

There is no broadcast station in Freetown but there is a rediffusion system on which the Public Relations Department produces local programmes as well as rediffusing B.B.C. programmes.

Freetown has two commercial cinemas and there are also 35 mm. cinemas at the two mining centres at Marampa and Yengema. Film shows are also given on portable projectors, and from a mobile cinema van which operates in the Protectorate.

A Weekly Bulletin is published by the Public Relations Department with a circulation of 5,000 copies weekly.

**Health**

There are Government hospitals in the Protectorate at Bo, Kailahun, Moyamba, Makeni, Port Loko, Pujehun, and Kabala. In the Colony area there are the Connaught Hospital with an annexe at Murray Town, the Hill Station Hospital, the Freetown Maternity Hospital, the Infectious Diseases Hospital at Lakka and a general hospital at Bonthe. These hospitals provide accommodation for 589 in-patients plus 35 cots for children. There is also a Mental Hospital at Kissy designed to accommodate 112 inmates and a home for the chronic sick with accommodation for 87 patients. Facilities exist at two Government hospitals for training of students as nurses, and two hospitals train midwives; two of these hospitals are in the Colony and one in the Protectorate. In addition to 24 permanent and 9 lock-up dispensaries, there are 15 dispensaries and treatment centres of the Endemic Diseases Control Unit, formerly the Yaws and Sleeping Sickness Campaign, maintained by Government. There are also nine Native Administration dispensaries. Malaria control in Freetown and its environs has been undertaken for some considerable time and the number of malaria-carrying mosquitoes has been much reduced. There are five mission hospitals and two hospitals associated with mines in the Protectorate and one mission hospital in Freetown.

**Labour**

The Labour Department is responsible for the application of Government policy concerning labour matters, and assists in the formulation of policy after consultation with representative organizations of employers and workers. Its more specific functions include the setting up of statutory Wages Boards, the development of voluntary wage-negotiating and joint consultative machinery, conciliation in trade disputes, wages inspection, the operation of employment exchanges, the registration (by photographs and finger printing) of workers in certain areas, the collation of statistics (including retail prices indices), the issue of trade test certificates, mediation in workmen's compensation cases, general supervision to secure the observance of other labour regulations, and assistance to workers' organisations through a Trade Union Adviser.

The Department also manages a Technical Training Centre which provides training for semi-skilled workers.

**Welfare**

The Social Welfare Department deals with individual cases of matrimonial difficulty, illegitimacy, maintenance, guardianship, education and difficult children, including juvenile delinquents. An Approved School was opened in 1947 and a Remand Home in 1946.

The Department supervised the running of the Freetown Community Centre which was used in 1949 for 860 meetings, attended by close on 20,000 persons. During 1949, 47 youth organisations were registered with the Department with a total membership of 4,100 and an age range of 8 to 40 years. The groups' interests are mainly religious, social, literary and handicrafts. The Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Boys' Brigade movements, Women's Institutes and branches of the British Red Cross are active in the Colony and the Protectorate.

The Department runs Youth Leadership Training Courses for clubs as well as youth camps.

Work with women and youth clubs was started in the Colony Rural Areas. A Welfare Centre was opened at Lansar in 1948 and at Bo in 1949 and a similar one for women and children started at Marampa at the request of the management of the Mines.

**Communications**

**Roads**

Up to 31st December, 1949, there were 1,208 miles of first-class roads in the Protectorate maintained by the Public Works Department, and 413 miles of lower standard maintained by local authorities.

In the Colony Peninsula there are 166 miles of roads maintained by the Public Works Department of which 82 miles are bitumen surfaced.

**Railways**

The main line of the Sierra Leone Government railway, which was the first railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the
Freetown terminus to Pendembu in the Kailahun district, a distance of 227½ miles. From Bauya Junction, 64½ miles from Freetown, a branch line runs to Makeni, a distance of 82½ miles. The number of stations and flag stations is 64. The gauge of the railway is 2 feet 6 inches. A survey is now being made to provide for a limited re-alignment of the Bo to Bauya section of the line. The Marampa Railway (3 feet 6 inches gauge) running from the iron ore deposits at Marampa to Pepel, the port of shipment, is 57½ miles long. This railway is owned by the Sierra Leone Development Company, Limited, and is used only for the transport of iron ore.

The total revenue and expenditure of the Government railway for 1949 were £437,147 and £535,149 respectively.

Shipping

Mail steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown and Freetown for Liverpool every three weeks, the passage taking about nine days. There are also a number of small passenger vessels which run at irregular intervals.

The tonnage of shipping entered and cleared for the period 1940-1949 was as follows:

| Year | British Tonnage | Total Tonnage |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1940 | 9,508,551       | 11,345,781    |
| 1941 | 6,113,793       | 8,162,249     |
| 1942 | 6,919,931       | 8,927,347     |
| 1943 | 6,022,960       | 7,704,328     |
| 1944 | 5,930,264       | 7,899,823     |
| 1945 | 3,926,737       | 5,220,839     |
| 1946 | 3,888,385       | 4,846,870     |
| 1947 | 3,405,980       | 4,068,560     |
| 1948 | 3,698,540       | 4,708,209     |
| 1949 | 3,646,271       | 4,711,763     |

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure | Public Debt |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
|      | £       | £           | £           |
| 1940 | 1,139,131 | 951,999     | 1,288,258   |
| 1941 | 1,281,666 | 1,109,258   | 1,288,258   |
| 1942 | 1,478,163 | 1,340,418   | 1,288,258   |
| 1943 | 1,747,838 | 1,588,008   | 1,369,683   |
| 1944 | 1,885,090 | 1,684,310   | 1,369,683   |
| 1945 | 1,841,960 | 1,911,958   | 1,369,684   |
| 1946 | 2,195,474 | 1,833,483   | 1,418,841   |
| 1947 | 2,109,500 | 2,119,500   | 1,418,841   |
| 1948 | 2,648,983 | 2,172,031   | 1,418,841   |
| 1949 | 2,730,340 | 2,457,661   | 1,418,841   |

The main sources of revenue are customs duties, mining royalties and taxation. The forms of direct taxation in Sierra Leone are Income Tax, Poll Tax, Profits' Tax and House Tax.

Customs duty is payable on most imported goods and on a few domestic exports. Import duties are collected either on an ad valorem or a "specific" basis, and a preference which in the majority of cases is equivalent to half the general rate, is granted to goods of British origin or manufacture, which term includes goods originating or manufactured in countries within the Empire.

The main head of expenditure in 1949 was £450,419 on Development schemes. Provincial Administration cost £105,693 whilst £212,075 was expended on Medical Services, £68,042 on Agriculture and £137,005 on Education.

The Sherbro River is navigable by ocean-going vessels for 36 miles from the Fairway Buoy to the anchorage. From the pilotage area off Banana Islands the distance in all is 52 miles. The Sierra Leone River is navigable as far as Pepel, some 15 miles above Freetown.

The Great Scarcies River, the Little Scarcies River, the Port Loko Creek, the Ribbi River, the Bumpe River, the Kagboro River, the Yukuli River, the Bagru River and the Jong River are all navigable by small craft of 3 feet to 7 feet for from 20 to 35 miles from their entrances.

The Kittam River is navigable for launches to Mani (about 90 miles) all the year and for 6 months each year to Pujehun.

Air

The West African Airways Corporation provides a service which connects with the trunk routes between the United Kingdom and West Africa. This service carries passengers and mail and uses the civil airport at Lungi. Aircraft of Air France also call at Lungi. There are small emergency landing grounds at Port Loko, Magburaka, Bo, Daru, Hastings, Waterloo, Kambia and Bonthe.

Posts and Telegraphs

There are 80 post offices and postal agencies in the Colony and Protectorate but money order and savings bank business is conducted at the larger offices only.

There are about 2,000 miles of telephone and telegraph lines in operation, the former operated by the Post Office and the latter by the Sierra Leone Railway. A trunk telephone line to link Bo with Freetown is now being constructed.

Wireless stations have been installed at several stations in the Protectorate and at Freetown a radio beacon for shipping is in operation.

Currency and Banking

West Africa silver coins (2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d.) were put into circulation in 1913, and alloy coins of similar denominations in 1920. Silver coinage is gradually being withdrawn. The alloy coinage which was put into circulation in 1920 is now also being withdrawn, a new form of alloy "security-edge" coinage having been introduced in January, 1939. The alloy 3d. piece was at the same time replaced by a nickel "security-edge" coin of larger dimensions. Currency notes of the value of 20s. and 10s. were introduced in 1916 and of 2s. in 1917, and 1s. in 1919, but the last two denominations are not now current. The Bank of British West Africa has one branch in Freetown and one at Bo with agencies in a few other Protectorate towns. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), Ltd., is also established in Freetown. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882.
PRODUCTION AND TRADE

The total value of imports into Sierra Leone in 1949 was £5,809,584 and of exports £4,664,566. Corresponding figures for 1948 were £4,979,350 and £4,164,566. As in previous years, the export figures do not include the value of diamonds and the value of produce differentials, the latter of which is estimated at £1,250,000. When these amounts are added to the export values, the apparent adverse balance would be turned into a very favourable balance of visible trade.

The direction of trade in 1949 was exports 78·48 per cent. to the United Kingdom as compared with 70·86 in 1948; 6·48 per cent. to other British possessions as compared with 21·99 in 1948; and 5·13 per cent. to the United States of America as compared with 2·63 in 1948; Imports: 63·73 per cent. from the United Kingdom as compared with 64·88 in the previous year; 20·04 from other British possessions as compared with 17·79 in 1948; and 3·12 per cent. from United States of America as compared with 4·21 in the previous year.

The largest single import in 1949 was cotton piece goods valued at £1,332,309. Compared with the 1948 figure of £1,128,702, the 1949 figure shows an increase of 18·0 per cent. When the quantities imported, i.e., square yards, are compared, the increase in 1949 is 18·1 per cent. over 1948 which indicates that, other things being equal, c.i.f. prices of imported cottons have remained fairly stable between 1948 and 1949.

The next largest import was coal valued at £302,893, which is required solely for railway operation. Other large imports were manufactured tobacco, empty jute bags and sacks for the produce export trade.

The largest single export in 1949 was palm kernel valued at £2,314,038. This figure was 33 per cent. up on the 1948 export. When quantities are compared, however, 76,541 tons in 1949 as against 66,431 in 1948, the increase is only 15 per cent. Next in value were diamonds, iron ore, kola nuts and ginger. Export commodities which showed a marked increase on the 1948 figures were as follows: Ginger increased from £73,682 (1,319 tons) in 1948 to £146,790 (1,395 tons) in 1950; peppers from £1,507 (36,329 lb.) to £3,836 (64,103 lb.). Figures for cocoa in 1949 show a drop from £102,941 (1,379 tons) in 1948 to £65,627 (714 tons) in 1949. The reason for this is that more than half of the 1949/50 season crop was shipped in early 1950 instead of the bulk being shipped in late 1949. This crop amounting to more than 1,700 tons of appreciably better quality will provide another step in establishing a reputation for Sierra Leone cocoa.

The new Government motor fishing trawler "Primula" (renamed "Rokel") arrived towards the end of 1949.

Sawn timber: Domestic requirements of sawn timber continued to be met by the sawn-milling operations of the Forest Department. Of the two mills formerly in operation one was closed down early in 1949, owing to the depletion of the forest in that area, and part of the plant was used to augment the output of the other. Primary production in 1949 amounted to 170,779 cubic feet of sawn timber and 77,886 shingles. The woodwork shops attached to the mill worked to capacity and sales of furniture and joinery totalled £4,116 in value.
