WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH COMMISSION

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by the Western Pacific Order-in-Council of 1877.

The High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised power. By the Pacific Order in Council of 1893 the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order-in-Council, 1922, the High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends also to the New Hebrides, and the Banks and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of the expenses of the British Agent and Consul in Tonga and the British Services in the New Hebrides.
The Chief Justice of Fiji and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a judicial commissioner.

Deputy commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

A Judicial Commissioner's Court has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions an appeal against all decisions of the High Commissioner's court lies to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons who endanger the peace of the islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (including the Phoenix and Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

**GILBERT AND ELLICE ISLANDS COLONY**

**Situation and Area**

The Colony consists of the following five geographical divisions (district headquarters being underlined).

(i) **The Gilbert Group**, lying between 4° N. and 3° S. and 172° E. and 177° E. and comprising the 16 islands of—

Little Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Aranuka, Nonouti, Tabiteua, Beru, Nikunau, Onotoa, Tamana and Aorae.

(ii) **The Ellice Group**, between 4° S. and 11° S. and 176° E. and 180° E. and comprising the 9 islands of—

Nanumea, Nanumanga, Niutao, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Niulakita.

(iii) **The Phoenix Group**, between 2° S. and 5° S. and 170° W. and 175° W. and comprising the 8 islands of—

Canton (Abariringa), Enderbury, McKean, Birnie, Phoenix, Sydney (Manra), Hull (Orona) and Gardner (Nikumaroro).

(iv) **The Northern Line Islands**, between 1° N. and 4° N. and 157° W. and 161° W. and comprising the 3 islands of—

Fanning, Washington and Christmas.

(v) **Ocean Island**, in 1° S. and 169° E.

Although the Colony spans some 2 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean, the aggregate land area is estimated to be only 375 square miles, of which Christmas Island comprises approximately 220 square miles.

**Climate**

The climate of the islands is pleasant, being warm but not humid. It is tempered by the trade winds, and the nights are cool for the equatorial regions. All parts of the Colony are fairly healthy for Europeans but many of the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. The rainfall during the year 1949 amounted to 91·02 inches at Tarawa, 140·58 inches at Funafuti, 15·63 inches at Canton, and 69·16 inches at Fanning. The wettest months are usually December, January and February, while those of least rainfall are September and October. In normal seasons the annual rainfall in the Gilbert and Ellice Groups varies from 40 inches in the vicinity of the equator to about 100 inches in the northern Gilberts and 120 inches in the southern...
Ellice Islands, although in 1949 and 1950 the Colony suffered from a severe drought, which considerably affected food supplies and copra production. The daily and annual ranges of temperature are small.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

Apart from Ocean, which is of the "raised" coral type with a maximum elevation of 280 feet, all the islands are low and flat and of the same basic coral formation. Their average height above sea level is from 10 to 15 feet and their width about five furlongs. Over half are atolls; mere ribbons of land up to 90 miles in length and only in a few places more than 200 yards in width. The remainder are reef islands, consisting of solid masses of limestone surrounded by fringing reefs. The soil is a light coral sand with very little organic matter; it is, however, suitable for coconut growing and most islands are heavily wooded with coconut palms.

**POPULATION**

The population of the Colony, as determined by the 1947 census, was as follows:

| Gilbert Islands | 27,824 |
|-----------------|--------|
| Ellice Islands  | 4,487  |
| Phoenix Islands | 984    |
| Line Islands    | 469    |
| Ocean Island    | 2,060  |
| Ships           | 176    |
| **Total**       | **36,000** |

comprising

| Micronesians*   | 29,923 |
| Polynesians†    | 5,066  |
| Europeans       | 304    |
| Mongolians      | 142    |
| European-Micronesians | 286 |
| European-Polynesians | 73 |
| Mongolian-Micronesians | 164 |
| Other racial divisions | 42 |
| **Total**       | **36,000** |

* Mainly Gilbertese.
† Mainly Ellice Islanders.

**RELIGION**

Most of the native population are Christians, being adherents of the London Missionary Society or of the Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. At the time of the 1947 census, declarations were as follows (Micronesians and Polynesians only):

| London Missionary Society | 20,874 |
| Roman Catholic            | 13,799 |
| Seventh Day Adventists    | 7      |
| Animist                   | 309    |

**HISTORY**

The Gilbert Islands were first discovered by Europeans in 1765, when Byron sighted the island of Nikunau. Further discoveries were made in 1788 by Gilbert and Marshall, who visited most of the northern islands of the Group; in 1799 by Bishop; in 1809 by Patterson and in 1824 by Duperrey. In 1841 two ships of the United States Exploring Expedition visited many of the Gilbert Islands.

The first European settlers were mainly deserters from ships, a number of whom engaged in trading with the natives. By the sale of liquor and firearms they added to the lawlessness of the period as well as to the savagery of the frequent wars in which the Gilbertese, impelled by lack of sufficient land for their population, had been long engaged. In 1857 Dr. Hiram Bingham of the American Board of Foreign Missions landed at Abaiang and established the first Christian Mission. The London Missionary Society, which eventually took over from the American Board of Foreign Missions, began work in the southern part of the group in 1870 and the Sacred Heart Mission in the central islands in 1888.

The first certain European discovery in the Ellice group was in 1781, when Maurelle discovered Nanumea, though it is possible that Mendana may have sighted one of the islands in 1568. Further discoveries were made by Patterson in 1809, de Peyster in 1819 and the Wilkes Expedition in 1841. Missionary work was begun by the London Missionary Society, operating from Samoa, in 1860. The southern Ellice Islands suffered from the depredations of the "blackbirders" during the second half of the nineteenth century, Nukulaelae being almost depopulated.

In the Phoenix Group, Canton Island was visited by H.M.S. "Curacao" (Captain Gibson) in the 1850's and in 1854 the New Bedford whaler "Canton" was wrecked on the south-eastern reef. Gardner Island was discovered by Coffin in 1828 and Hull Island by the Wilkes Expedition in 1840. Guano diggers visited the group towards the end of the nineteenth century, but the works have been long abandoned.

Christmas Island was discovered by Captain James Cook in 1777. In 1798 both Fanning and Washington Islands were visited by Captain Fanning of the American whaler "Betsy".

A British Protectorate was proclaimed over the Gilbert and Ellice groups by Captain Davis of H.M.S. "Royalist" in 1892. In 1915 the protectorate became a colony, and its boundaries were extended to include Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands in 1916, Christmas Island in 1917 and the Phoenix Islands in 1937. Canton and Enderbury were placed under joint Anglo-American control by an Exchange of Notes dated the 6th April, 1939.

On the establishment of the protectorate an era of peaceful development ensued, and medical and educational services were developed. The increasing population of the Gilbert Islands made it necessary to find an outlet for expansion, and the interests of Messrs. Burns, Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd., in the Phoenix group were acquired in 1937, and Sydney, Hull and Gardner Islands colonised by Gilbertese settlers the following year.

Commercial expansion has consisted mainly in the working of the phosphate deposits on Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners and the operation of coconut plantations on Fanning and Washington Islands by Messrs. Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd. In 1914 the Central Pacific Cocoanut Plantations, Ltd., of London, were granted the exclusive right to occupy Christmas Island. Since 1940, however the plantations on this island have been operated by the Colony Government, and in 1949 the licence of occupation of the Central Pacific Coconut Plantation was revoked, Government resuming full possession of the island. A mid-ocean relay station of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., was established on Fanning in 1902.

In December, 1941, on the outbreak of war with Japan, and during the early months of 1942, Tarawa and Butaritari were raided at intervals by
Japanese warships and Ocean Island was bombed by Japanese aircraft, which also made occasional bombing raids on islands of the Gilbert group. In August and September, 1942, Japanese naval forces occupied Ocean Island and the Islands of Tarawa, Butaritari and Abemama, and visited all the other islands of the Gilbert group with the exception of Arorae.

Although the enemy actually occupied only four islands, the activities of Japanese naval and air units effectually cut off all communication with the Gilbert Islands until November, 1943, when American forces, after heavy fighting at Tarawa, cleared the enemy from the group. Tarawa and Butaritari were thereupon used by the Americans as advanced bases for war operations against the enemy in the north-western Pacific. Ocean Island remained in enemy hands until after the surrender of Japan.

The Ellice Islands were not at any time invaded by the enemy but were occupied by American forces during 1942, and military, naval and air bases were established at Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau.

In the Phoenix Islands an American base was established on Canton, which became of great importance for military aircraft on the trans-Pacific air route.

The Line Islands were free from enemy molestation throughout the war but were garrisoned by allied forces and under military administration.

Immediately upon the reoccupation of Ocean Island, the British Phosphate Commissioners sent in men and materials to commence the rehabilitation of the phosphate industry and recommenced production in 1946.

The native population of Ocean Island, comprising some 900 Banabans and 1,200 Gilbertese, was deported by the Japanese during 1942 and 1943, some being sent to Nauru and others to the Caroline Islands and Tarawa.

The Banabans were collected in November and December, 1945, and, as their village and means of sustenance in Ocean Island had been destroyed by the enemy, were transported, with their own consent, to Rabi Island, in the Fiji Group, which had been purchased as their future home in 1942.

Since reoccupation the headquarters of the Colony Government has been located on Tarawa.

**CONSTITUTION**

The constitution is laid down by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Order in Council, 1915, which continued in effect, with modifications, the provisions of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. The Colony is administered by a Resident Commissioner acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, who resides in Fiji. The laws consist of local Ordinances enacted by the High Commissioner under powers conferred by the above-mentioned Orders in Council, together with such British Acts as are of general application.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The Colony is divided into five administrative districts—the Gilbert Islands District, the Ellice Islands District, the Ocean Island District, the Phoenix Islands District and the Line Islands District. Each district is under the control of an Administrative Officer, assisted by Assistant Administrative Officers in the larger districts. Each island with an indigenous population has its own Native Government and Island Council, presided over by a native magistrate. A code of native laws is validated by a Colony Ordinance and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of the Department of District Administration.

The Administrative Officer, Phoenix Islands District, acts as British Official for the Joint Administration of Canton and Enderbury Islands, the corresponding American officer being the Station Manager of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, a branch of the United States Department of Commerce.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

There are Government boarding schools for boys at Abemama and Vaitupu and Government primary schools for boys and girls at Colony Headquarters and Ocean Island, but village education is mainly in the hands of the Missions, assisted by Government grants. The more promising pupils are sent to Fiji for secondary education, followed by professional training at the Central Medical School or the Teachers' Training Institution, and a scheme has recently been commenced by which a few students each year will be able to complete their education at New Zealand public schools and the University.

**Information Services**

Two monthly news-sheets in the vernacular are produced in the Colony: *Tero* (Gilbertese) and *Tala o Tuvalu* (Ellice). News of world as well as local importance is included. The editor of these publications is also the Public Relations Officer. Items of general and special interest are also contained in the printed Colony Annual Reports and the Annual Reports of the Medical and Education Departments.

**Health**

The Central Hospital for the Colony is located at Tarawa and is supervised by the Senior Medical Officer. A hospital is maintained on Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners and a dispensary on Fanning Island by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., each with European medical officers. All other permanently inhabited islands have island hospitals under the charge of either assistant medical practitioners trained at the Central Medical School at Suva or of dressers trained at the Tarawa Hospital. Nurses are trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

**Labour**

There is no Labour Department in the Colony, the enforcement of the labour legislation being the responsibility of the Department of District Administration.

**Welfare**

Inherent in both Gilbert and Ellice Islanders is a strong family feeling. All laws and activities are coloured by this trait and the problem of social welfare greatly reduced and eased thereby. The islands in the Colony are so small that Government (in the shape of Native Administrations in the islands and the Colony Administration, acting through touring District Officers) is closely in touch with the needs of the people, their actions, health and character. In addition, the missions, with their native teachers or pastors in many of the villages are also in constant touch with the people.

In the Ellice Islands, particularly, community organisations have been established by the people, consisting of young men's clubs (to carry out community duties as well as sporting activities)
and women's committees (to look after island cleanliness, child welfare and assist in care of the sick).

**Communications**

**Roads**

All islands in the Colony, with the exception of those recently settled by Gilbertese in the Phoenix group, have lagoon-side roads running their entire length, broken only where the atolls are divided into separate islets. These roads, made of reef mud, stand up reasonably well to the normal bicycle and slight amount of motor traffic. There were 64 motor vehicles in the Colony in 1949 (all but 6 being commercial ones).

**Railways**

There are no railways in the Colony apart from about 4 miles of 2-foot gauge line on Ocean Island used for conveying phosphate from the fields to the dryers. Light tramways are maintained at Fanning and Washington Islands by Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd., and Cable and Wireless, Ltd.

**Canals**

At Washington Island there are 7½ miles of canals dug in 1906 and nowadays maintained by Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd., for the purpose of conveying copra from the plantations to the settlement.

**Shipping**

For shipping communications with the outside world the Colony is dependent on:

(a) phosphate vessels plying between Ocean and Australia or New Zealand;

(b) cargo vessels calling at Tarawa about every three months and the Line Islands about once a year to load copra for the United Kingdom;

(c) annual recruiting trips operated by the British Phosphate Commissioners or Messrs. Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd.;

(d) small Government and other ships plying between Fiji and Funafuti or Tarawa;

(e) cargo vessels chartered thrice-yearly by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., to visit Fanning Island; and

(f) Occasional fishing vessels and yachts which call in the Line Islands en route from Hawaii to Tahiti.

Within the Colony irregular communication is maintained with all permanently inhabited islands by small vessels belonging to the Government (4), Missions (3) or the Colony Wholesale Society (2), supplemented by occasional chartered craft.

**Air**

Regular air services operated by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Pan-American World Airways and Canadian Pacific Airways touch the Colony at Canton Island, in the Phoenix Group, which is a refuelling point for aircraft on the trans-Pacific air route from the American continent to Australasia. An emergency landing ground exists at Tarawa and emergency seaplane alighting areas at Tarawa and Funafuti. Catalina seaplanes operated by the Royal New Zealand Air Force visit both islands at very irregular intervals with passengers and cargo from Suva.

**Posts and Telegraphs**

The Central Post Office is on Tarawa, with branch post offices on most inhabited islands. The Colony Treasurer is ex officio Chief Postmaster.

With 22 radio stations now operating, over two-thirds of the inhabited islands are served with wireless communication. There are three European Wireless Officers at the Tarawa head station, the out-stations being staffed entirely by natives. Messages for beyond the Colony, including meteorological reports from eight observation stations and private radiograms for all parts of the world, are passed through Tarawa to Suva radio.

**Public Finance**

The Colony has no public debt. While before the war it was self-supporting it was necessary, from 1942 onwards, due to the enemy occupation of the Colony and resultant contraction in revenue, to receive a grant-in-aid from His Majesty's Government to meet the costs of normal administration. By 1948–49 revenue had revived sufficiently to exceed normal expenditure by an estimated £A.26,000 but a grant-in-aid was still necessary to meet items of special war and rehabilitation expenditure.

During the financial year 1947–48, the latest for which actual figures are available, it is pleasing to be able to record that the revenue which amounted to £A.141,142 increased considerably over the previous year's figure and also exceeded estimates by nearly £A.24,000. This was due largely to increased customs duty receipts attributable to increased imports of consumer goods and export of copra. Other increases resulted from greater movement of Government shipping in the Colony with increased freight receipts.

The period of the financial year, which since 1946 has run from 1st April until the following 31st March, was changed in 1949 to coincide with the calendar year. The 1949 financial year thus ran for nine months only, ending on 31st December, 1949.

The main heads of taxation are Import Duties, an Export Duty on copra at the rate of 25 per cent. of the f.o.b. value; Landowners' Tax (payable in copra); a Capitation Tax of £A.10 per capita on non-native residents other than Government officials, ministers of religion and certain other specified categories; and Income Tax, which was introduced for the first time in 1941.

Under the Customs Tariff there is on most articles an ad valorem import duty of 25 per cent. (British preferential rate 12½ per cent.). On machinery the rate is 20 per cent.; on bicycles and perfumery 30 per cent. and on jewellery 40 per cent. (British preferential rates being half the above.) Certain goods, of which the principal are flour, rice, milk, fruits and vegetables, sugar and plain soap, are subject to a general rate of 12½ per cent. but are duty free if produced within the Empire. The general import duty rate on beer is £A.6s. per gallon, on spirits £A.2 5s. per gallon and cigarettes £A.1 6s. 8d. per thousand (British preferential rates being £A.2s., £A.1 10s. and £A.1 respectively).

**Normal Revenue and Expenditure**

(excluding Grants-in-Aid, and Colonial Development and Welfare Grants)

| Year       | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 1946–47 Actual | 94,221  | 133,251     |
| 1947–48 Actual | 141,142 | 182,317     |
| 1948–49 Estimated | 235,303 | 209,312     |
| 1949 Estimated (nine months) | 190,601 | 176,090     |
| 1950 Estimated (twelve months) | 259,574 | 257,339     |
CURRENCY AND BANKING

There are no commercial banks operating in the Colony, business being transacted through banks in Fiji or the neighbouring Dominions. A Government Savings Bank commenced operation in September, 1948, and there are also agencies of the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia on Ocean and Fanning Islands. Australian currency is used throughout the Colony, the amount of currency in circulation at the end of 1949 being estimated at £A.148,050.

PRODUCTION AND TRADE

The main exports of the Colony are phosphate of lime from Ocean Island and copra. Shipments of phosphate during 1949 amounted to 260,900 tons and of copra 7,474 tons, valued provisionally at £A.508,440.

The principal imports of the Colony are rice and other foodstuffs, and cotton piece goods. There are no factories and practically all goods, with the exception of fish and the products of the coconut and pandanus palms, have to be imported. Total imports, excluding those of Ocean Island, during the financial year 1947–48 amounted to £A.134,189, of which the main items were: rice, £A.15,496; cotton piece goods, £A.16,958; tobacco, £A.3,561; biscuits, £A.4,371; flour, £A.15,831; soap, £A.686; sugar, £A.4,206; machinery, £A.2,041; and milk, £A.1,813.

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE

SITUATION AND AREA

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is situated between the parallels of 5° S., and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° of E. longitude.

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands extending at its extremities from Bougainville Straits to Mitre Island, in the Santa Cruz group, for a distance of 900 miles, and north and south from the Ontong Java group to Rennell Island for a distance of 430 miles, in an area approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,000 square miles are land.

CLIMATE

The climate of the Solomon Islands, since the introduction of paludrine and the consequent reasonably effective suppression of malaria in persons taking regular prophylactic doses, is not regarded as unhealthy. Conditions of living have been greatly improved during recent years.

Generally speaking, the seasons are well defined by the trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the lowest minimum temperature is recorded, and the highest mean and maximum temperatures are, as a rule, recorded in the months from November to April which is commonly known as the north-west season.

The rainfall varies considerably from month to month and year to year, though the average rainfall, recorded at Tulagi, is approximately 120 inches a year.

| 1937 | 124-87 |
| 1938 | 145-50 |

Rainfall is not now taken at Tulagi. From Ilu Farm near Honiara, the new capital of the Protectorate, the following figures are available.

A meteorological station was established at Honiara in 1950. Readings for 1950 were incomplete at the time of preparation of this survey.

POPULATION

The estimated population in 1950 was:

- Europeans: 400
- Melanesians: 95,000
- Polynesians: 3,808
- Chinese: 130

Total: 99,338

HISTORY

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in the year 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. The island first sighted they named Ysabel because it was on that Saint's day that they left Callao. In the year 1595 a second expedition under Mendana sailed from Peru, but failed to locate the island of Guadalcanal, whereon it was intended he should form a settlement, and he arrived in the Santa Cruz group, and landed at Graciosa Bay. The new colony proved a failure, the death of Mendana put an end to any prospect of success, and the remnants of the original party returned to Peru.

In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the islands of Malaita.

In the same year de Bougainville in the frigate La Boudese, sailed from Monte Video on a deliberate quest of the Terra Australis which he missed, and arrived at New Guinea; in sailing back he passed through the Straits which are the present north-eastern boundary of the Protectorate, the island on the right being named Bougainville after him, and the one on the left named after Choiseul, who was at the time Minister of France.

Twenty years later, and 700 miles to the south-east, la Perouse, in command of the French frigates L'Astrolabe and La Boussole, on a voyage of discovery, was wrecked at P'iou on the island of Vanikoro. His fate was unknown for 40 years.

From this time many Europeans visited the group, and British ships-of-war paid periodical visits.

In 1860 natives were recruited to work on plantations in Queensland and Fiji. The recruiting for Queensland ceased in 1903 and most of the natives were repatriated.

Recruiting for Fiji continued until 1910.

Between the years 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the Southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristoval, the New Georgia Group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50.

In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tucopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona, were added to the Protectorate, and in 1900 the northern islands, namely, Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits, south and south-east of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ontong Java, were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

Early in 1942 Japanese aircraft commenced bombing raids on the Protectorate capital at Tulagi, and when enemy invasion became imminent in February and March the majority of the non-native population, including all Government officials who could be spared, were evacuated to Australia. The Resident Commissioner and a number of officers remained in the Protectorate to continue the administration so far as possible, but evacuated Tulagi and other stations on the seashore and moved to various places in the interior of the larger islands. The Resident Commissioner, with a wireless officer equipped with a portable radio, moved to Malaita, whence he maintained communication with his officers and radio communication with Suva and other stations, collecting and passing out invaluable intelligence reports of enemy movements and activities until the landing of American forces later in the year.

During the early months of 1942 the enemy overrun and occupied the western half of the Protectorate as far as Guadalcanal, Nggela and
Ysabel, and established a post on the north-western end of Malaita. In Guadalcanal the Japanese immediately commenced the construction of an airfield with the obvious intention of using it as an advanced base for the bombing of areas to the south and west.

In August, 1942, the American Marine Division landed in Tulagi and Guadalcanal, occupied the Japanese airfield (later developed into the Henderson airfield) and, after some months of stiff fighting, drove the enemy out of the central portion of the Protectorate. On the arrival of the American forces the Resident Commissioner established contact with the commander and the administration thereafter operated as a military administration under the control of the military commander.

During 1943 the enemy was dislodged from the western end of the Protectorate, with the exception of the small Shortland group and the north-western tip of the large island of Choiseul which remained in enemy hands until the surrender of Japan.

The economy of the Protectorate is based almost wholly on the copra industry and the greater part of the copra exported before the war was produced on coconut plantations owned and operated by Europeans. On the retirement early in 1942 of the non-native population before the Japanese invasion the plantations were necessarily abandoned, and, with the rapid tropical growth of underbrush during four years of neglect, have deteriorated greatly; and this, combined with the severe damage caused by war operations, has reduced the potential of copra production by at least 50 per cent. since 1941, when it stood at about 24,000 tons per annum.

Until 1948, the Protectorate relied almost entirely upon a small vessel of 288 tons for overseas shipping communications, the vessel being owned and operated by the Government. In 1948, however, an approximately monthly shipping service with Australia was re-established by Messrs. Burns, Philp's vessels, Multiaman and Morinda and the consolidation of this supply link had an immediately beneficial effect on the Protectorate's economy. Copra production rose steadily during 1949 and had reached more than a third of the potential production by the end of the year. Production continued to rise during 1950.

Apart from the Allied forces engaged in local war operations, large bases were established in the Protectorate for operations further afield and consequently very large Allied forces were in occupation or temporarily quartered in the group. The effect upon the native population of contact with such large numbers of Allied servicemen was necessarily great and far-reaching and a certain disruption of native life and change in outlook was inevitable. It is yet too early to say to what extent these effects will have made a permanent impression upon the natives but they are being felt in many directions and are likely to have an important bearing on the resumption of the normal economic life of the Protectorate.

An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory was the great loyalty of the native people to their British connection and to the Allied cause generally.

ADMINISTRATION

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed at Honiara in Guadalcanal) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific (who resides in Suva, Fiji).

There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of King's Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893.

There is an Advisory Council, consisting of the Resident Commissioner and not more than fourteen members, four of whom may be officials, and five of whom may be natives of the Protectorate, the remaining five being non-official European residents.

**Customs and Trade**

The Customs tariff consists of duties at specific or ad valorem rates and includes provision for Empire preferences. During the reconstructional stage through which the Protectorate is passing, it has not been possible to extract accurate details of trade, but it is estimated that during 1946 the proportion of trading with various markets was as follows:

- United Kingdom: 30 per cent.
- Other parts of the British Empire: 67 per cent.
- Foreign markets: 3 per cent.

During 1947, imports were as follows:

| Country of Origin | Percentage |

TONGA

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, area about 250 square miles, situated between 18° and 22° south latitude, were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most are of coral formation, but some are volcanic. The Tongans are Polynesians, closely allied to the Maoris and Samoans. The islands are in three main groups, Vava'u, Ha'apai, and Tongatapu (containing the capital, Nuku'alofa). In the late 18th and early 19th centuries there was fierce civil war between the three groups, and not until 1845 did King George Tupou I succeed in uniting the whole of Tonga. The centenary of the unified kingdom was celebrated on 4th December, 1945.

King George Tupou I, who died in 1893, was succeeded by his great-grandson George Tupou II, on whose death in 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter, succeeded. The Queen, who was born in 1900, married the late Prince Uiliami Tungi, who died in 1941.

Queen Salote Tupou was made an Honorary G.B.E. on the occasion of the centenary in 1945. Her heir is her elder son, Tungi, B.A., LL.B. (Sydney), who was born in 1919.

CLIMATE

The climate is healthy. Although hot and humid from January to March, it is pleasantly cool during most of the remaining months. The temperature ranges from 53° to 93° F. The average annual rainfall varies between 70 inches in Tongatapu and 110 in Vava'u.
**POPULATION**

The following are the official estimates of population as at 31st December, 1949:

- Tongans: 45,690
- Europeans: 225
- Persons of mixed descent: 570
- Other Pacific Islanders: 310
- Others: 75

Total: 46,870

**RELIGION**

There are seven missions in Tonga:

- Wesleyan Free Church: 22,419
- Free Church of Tonga: 8,363
- Church of Tonga: 4,882
- Roman Catholics: 6,227
- Church of England: 550
- Church of Latter Day Saints: 2,800
- Seventh Day Adventists: 465

**HISTORY**

Much of the history of Tonga since the year 1826, when the first Wesleyan missionaries landed in Tonga, has been concerned with the relationship between Church and State. By the middle of the century practically all the chiefs and people had embraced Christianity, the great majority being Wesleyans. The control and management of the Wesleyan Mission remained with the Australasian Conference until 1883, when King George Tupou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded.

Assisted by the Rev. Shirley Baker, originally a Wesleyan missionary, then also Premier, the King established the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga as an independent body. In 1887 an attempt by some escaped native convicts on the Premier’s life was made the pretext for increased persecution of the “Fakaogos” or members of the original Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100 were deported to Fiji. At an enquiry by the High Commissioner the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker’s life was due to a “Fakaogo” conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the King, was addressed to the High Commissioner, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the mission church at once recommenced.

In 1890 further complaints were made; and Tongan officials denied that the King had promised to accord freedom of worship. Finding, after further inquiry, that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the trouble, Sir John Thurston prohibited him from being within the group for a term of two years. A few days earlier the King, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh government was formed with a Tongan Premier, Tukuaho. Under the new government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled.

In 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church and, after an enquiry into the state of the finances, it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies. At a joint conference union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. B. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued in respect of the ownership of the property of the church established by King George Tupou I, which was finally decided in favour of the United Church, now known as the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, of which the present Queen is the head.

**CONSTITUTION**

The present constitution was granted in 1875, although it has since been amended. It provides for a Government consisting of the Sovereign, a Privy Council and Cabinet, a Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary.

The Sovereign presides over the Privy Council, which consists of the Premier, the Ministers (at present three Tongans and one European, who are also heads of government departments), and the Governors of Vava’u and Ha’apai when they are at headquarters. The constitution of the Cabinet is similar, except that the Premier and not the Sovereign presides. The Legislative Assembly consists of the Premier and Ministers of the Crown (including the two Governors), seven representatives of the nobles elected by the nobles themselves, and seven representatives of the people elected by popular franchise, every male Tongan of 21 years of age who pays taxes and can read and write being qualified to vote. Elections for both the nobles and the representatives of the people are held every three years. The President of the Legislative Assembly is the Speaker, appointed by the Sovereign. The courts consist of a Supreme Court, a magistrate’s court and a land court. British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for over two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the court of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

Tonga is a self-governing protectorate under the protection of Great Britain, established by a Treaty of Friendship and Protection signed in 1900.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

There are both Government and Mission primary schools, primary education in Tonga being compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years. There are one Government and four Mission colleges for boys, at each of which provision is made for secondary education. The secondary education of girls is in the hands of the missions. There is a matriculation school in Nuku’alofo at which European children, children of mixed descent, and Tongan children are taught to the New Zealand University Entrance examination. The roll of the school at the end of 1949 was 70, of whom 30 were European or part-European children and 40 were Tongan. There is also a Teachers Training School for both Government and Mission Primary School teachers. The Tongans are entirely literate.

There are three public hospitals, the main one being at Nuku’alofo, where the Chief Medical Officer is in charge. There are 18 Tongan medical practitioners, trained at the Central Medical School in Fiji, stationed at various islands throughout the group.

Every male Tongan on reaching the taxable age of 16 years is entitled to 8½ acres of land for cultivation in addition to a small village allotment for his dwelling. For these two allotments he pays a tax of 8s. a year. He pays also an annual tax of 32s. for which free education, medical, hospital and dental treatment are provided.
COMMUNICATIONS

There is a monthly steamship service from New Zealand via Fiji, and vessels call at regular intervals to load copra for the United Kingdom.

There are about 200 miles of roads in the group, but a proportion of this mileage consists of earth roads which are only usable by motor traffic in dry weather.

There is a first-class aerodrome on the island of Tongatapu, large enough to take the largest aircraft, and limited seaplane facilities at Nuku'alofa and Vava'u harbours. Tonga is a port of call in the fortnightly air service maintained by the N.Z. National Airways Corporation between New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands.

There are five wireless stations in the group and a telephone service in Nuku'alofa.

There is no public debt, and the amount of accumulated balances on 31st December, 1949, was £403,687.

The main source of revenue is customs duties. In addition to a number of specific duties there is a general tariff of 3½ per cent. ad valorem and a British preferential tariff of 15 per cent. ad valorem.

There is also a Port and Customs Service tax on imports of 5 per cent.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

There has been a Government note issue since 1919, denominations being £5, £1, 10s. and 4s. The amount of notes in circulation on 31st December, 1949, was £155,760. Tongan currency is at present at a discount of 20 per cent. on sterling. United Kingdom, Australian, New Zealand and Fiji silver and copper coinage are legal tender.

There are no private banks in the kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1949 there were some 5,388 depositors and £165,377 in deposits.

TRADE

The chief exports are copra and bananas, the average annual export of copra being about 13,000 tons and of bananas about 60,000 cases. All copra is now shipped to the United Kingdom, the bananas to New Zealand.

THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONDOMINIUM OF THE NEW HEBRIDES

SITUATION AND AREA

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 13th and 21st degrees of south latitude and the 166th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 square miles.

CLIMATE

The rather enervating climate is generally classed as unhealthy owing to the prevalence of malaria, but conditions of living, particularly in the town of Vila, have improved greatly in recent years.

The year is divided into two fairly distinct seasons, the hot and wet season during which cyclones are experienced from November to April and the dry and cool season of the south-east trade winds from May to October. Temperatures at Vila range from a minimum of 56° F. to 94° F. Average annual rainfall ranges from about 45 inches in the south to about 250 inches in the north with an average of 74 inches in the town of Vila.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The New Hebrides islands are generally of coral with some volcanic formation. They are almost without exception mountainous, but most have narrow cultivable coastal strips. The highest peak is on the island of Santo and rises to over 6,000 feet. The growth of vegetation is very heavy and the soil is particularly suitable for the cultivation of tropical crops, the principal of which are coco-nuts, cocoa and coffee. The export of kauri logs has been developed since 1941 from Aneityum, the southernmost island of the group. No secondary industries exist.

POPULATION

A partly estimated census in 1946 placed at 45,000 the native population which is Melanesian with an admixture of Polynesian blood in certain parts of the group. Non-native population in December, 1949, was as follows:

European—

British Nationals, Protected Persons and Resortissants ... 436
French Citizens and Resortissants ... 1,230

Asiatic—

Labourers (imported) ... 1,828

Total ... 3,494
The Asiatic labourer population, 1,828 comprised the remains of Tonkinese labourers and their families (including 723 children), who had been introduced as indentured labour until 1940, awaiting repatriation. The remainder of the Asiatic population, included as resortissants, comprises principally Chinese storekeepers and market gardeners.

RELIGION

Missionary endeavour commenced with the arrival and massacre of Messrs. Williams and Harris of the London Missionary Society in 1839. Commencing in 1842, frequent and persistent attempts were made by various mission bodies for the christianising of the natives of the New Hebrides and half a century later established mission stations existed in various parts. The mission bodies at present carrying on work in the New Hebrides are those of the Presbyterian Church sponsored from different parts of the British Empire, the Melanesian Missionary Society, the Seventh Day Adventists, the Church of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church.

HISTORY

The new Hebrides group was discovered by the Spanish explorer de Quirós in 1606. The next mention came from the French navigator Bougainville in 1768 and later in 1774 Captain Cook visited and charted the greater part of the chain of islands comprising the New Hebrides. Other early visitors were Laperouse who supposedly visited the group in 1788 and D’Entrecasteaux who came in search of Laperouse in 1793. In this last year the sighting of the Banks Islands was recorded by Captain Bligh during his open boat voyage to Timor after the mutiny of the Bounty. Dumont d’Urville, Belcher and Markham also left records of early visits to the New Hebrides.

CONSTITUTION

Before any national eyes were turned on the New Hebrides a number of British and French missionaries, planters and traders had established themselves throughout the New Hebrides, and in 1887, by the Anglo-French Convention of 16th November, each nation agreed not to exercise separate control over the group and appointed a Joint Naval Commission, consisting of the captains and two officers from visiting warships charged with the protection in the New Hebrides of the lives and property of the subjects of the two nations—France and England. In 1895 the British and French colonists established an Arbitration Court, to deal principally with land disputes, but this was later dissolved on the veto of the Joint Naval Commission. In 1902 Deputy Resident Commissioners were appointed and took up residence in the territory.

In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on 20th October, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on 2nd December, 1907. Its provisions included the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert.

A Protocol, drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on 18th March, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

ADMINISTRATION

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of national officers, have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium mixed British and French staff working in departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners. There are a British and a French National Administrative Officer stationed in each Administrative District as the District Agents of the Resident Commissioners.

The Condominium Government consists of the two Resident Commissioners, as delegates of the two High Commissioners, acting in concert in matters of joint concern or related to the provisions of the Protocol. Each Resident Commissioner is, in addition, the executive head of his own national administration. British, French and Condominium law are administered by British, French and joint judicial authorities respectively.

SOCIAL SERVICES

French Government hospitals and medical aid posts are established at different points and staffed by French National Medical Officers. Supported and subsidised by H.M. Government, hospitals and medical aid posts have been established by some of the British mission bodies on several of the islands. British and French National Medical Officers comprise a Condominium medical service providing quarantine facilities, medical inspection of plantation and other labour and medical assistance to the native population. This joint service is reinforced by New Hebridean Assistant Medical Practitioners trained at the Central Medical School, Suva, some belonging to the Condominium and some to the British national service. Considerable simple medical work for natives is carried out by missionaries.

The French Government has established a primary school at Vila and the French Roman Catholic Mission has schools at Vila and Santo. H.M. Government subsidises a co-operative British primary school and a Presbyterian Mission primary school for natives at Vila. Village schools for natives are conducted by mission bodies in the vicinity of their stations throughout the Group.

Inspection of indentured and other labour is carried out by the District Agents.

COMMUNICATIONS

There are no railways or tramways. Shipping services are maintained with Sydney, Australia, Noumea, New Caledonia, Marseilles, via the Panama Canal, and San Francisco. Frequent air services from Australia and New Caledonia are in existence. Some of these continue to the British Solomons. Postal communications are via Noumea and Australia by the shipping and air services mentioned. Telegraphic communication is by direct wireless contact with Suva, Fiji, Noumea, New Caledonia, and Sydney, Australia.

Currency and Banking

English sterling and French currency, "authorised" by the power concerned, are both legal tender in the New Hebrides. Australian currency is officially recognised in substitution for sterling at current exchange rates. Since 1941 bank notes of the Bank of Indo China, Noumea, overprinted "Nouvelles Hébrides, France Libre," with a Cross of Lorraine and equivalent New Hebridean "bons du Tresor" have replaced the notes of the Bank of Indo China, formerly accepted pari passu with those of the Bank of France. There is an Agency of the Bank of Indo China in Vila.

The customs tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

During 1946 and 1947 owing to restrictions and market and shipping difficulties elsewhere, import trade veered sharply towards the U.S.A., but from 1948 onwards, owing to dollar shortage and improvement in export conditions from other markets, trade with U.S.A. was reduced and stimulated from Australia, U.K. and France.

During 1949 copra continued to go to France (with one shipment to Canada) and cocoa to France and Australia. The largest export by far was copra (approximately 22,400 tons in 1949). The disappearance of imported labour hindered production. Copra reached the record price of £(Stg.) 75 per ton f.o.b. in 1949, but fell considerably in 1950.

The World War, 1939-45

Repercussions were felt in the New Hebrides early in the European war with the loss of its principal export market, France, but these effects were greatly offset by the absorption by Australia of the cocoa and coffee crops and such proportion of the copra production for which occasional shipping became available. Later, the New Hebrides copra production was allocated to the U.S.A. whence it continued to be exported within shipping limitations until the re-opening of the French market.

In December, 1941, the New Hebrides Defence Force was formed and trained locally by a detachment of the Australian Imperial Forces under arrangements made with the Commonwealth Government. Officers and N.C.O.s of the local force were recruited from among British and French Nationals resident in the territory and other ranks from among New Hebridean natives. The New Hebrides Defence Force did not see active service but carried out observation post duties in the extreme northern parts of the Group.

In March, 1942, units of the U.S. Forces commenced the establishment of forward bases in the New Hebrides which in the ensuing years, were used to a very considerable extent as staging and training bases by the Allied Forces during the prosecution of the campaign against the Japanese.

From August, 1942, until March, 1943, the Japanese carried out spasmodic nuisance bombing raids on the island of Santo, employing flying boats based in the Solomon Islands. The raiding parties, comprising never more than three aircraft, always operated at night and on no occasion caused any material damage.

The direct effects of the war on the New Hebrides were, therefore, confined to interruption of shipping services with consequent disruption of production, the latter being aggravated by the depletion of the supply of native and Asiatic labourers available through their employment on military construction work, whilst the indirect effect on the native population of prolonged contact with overwhelmingly large numbers of personnel of the Allied Forces was very considerable, in so far as it affected their general outlook, ways of living and sense of economic values, though these effects are gradually becoming less apparent with the passage of time since the final departure of all Allied Forces from the Group.

PITCAIRN ISLAND

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (latitude 25° 3'S., longitude 130° 8' W.). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. Bounty, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population (at 30th June, 1948) numbered 124 persons.

It is a British colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the West Pacific in 1898 under section 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

Chief Magistrate—Warren Christian.

The Government is now administered under the High Commissioner, by a Council consisting of a chief magistrate, two assessors, a secretary and a chairman of the internal committee. These officers are elected annually by the people.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.

THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

Situation and Area

The Windward Islands consist of the four islands of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically—Tobago from 1764 to 1784, and all three in 1838. The three last named islands and, as from 1st January, 1940, Dominica, which on that date was separated from the Leeward Islands, are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the four colonies is 829 square miles.

History

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here.

As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white, and there are some Indian coolies. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia and Dominica the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

Constitution

Each island retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary for the Windward Islands. The colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica are presided over by resident administrators. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 by Imperial Act (9 and 10 Geo. V. c. 47) and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established by the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands (Courts) Order-in-Council 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889.

It has been announced that it is intended shortly to alter the constitutions of the four islands to provide for Legislative Council of 14 members, the Administrators as Presidents, two other ex officio members, three nominated members and eight members elected by universal adult suffrage. The Legislative Councils will elect three members to Executive Councils.

Communications

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 16 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line. The passenger and cargo steamers of the Canadian
National Line call at Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Dominica and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. Government-owned telephone systems exist throughout the islands. All four islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with the West Indies and Canada through the system of Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Ltd., and thence with Great Britain and all parts of the world through the system of Cable & Wireless, Ltd. A coast station is also maintained at St. Lucia for communication with ships at sea.

Airfields have been constructed at Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two Colonies are at present served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule.

A temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is operated by British Guiana Airways between Grenada, St. Vincent and Dominica.

A wireless installation has been erected at Carriacou by the local Government. It communicates with Grenada and through that island to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, etc., the ordinary tariff being 2d. per word more than from Grenada.

**Dominica**

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. latitude, and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. longitude; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about 30 miles, and has an area of 304½ square miles.

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet.

Dominica was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £312,092 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and Tobago.
In 1771 the island was constituted a separate government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On 21st June, 1775, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on 7th September after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to flee, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading general), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000 to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts, near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a governor-in-chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and bluejackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H.L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of £15,000 by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the island. Owing to the economic depression of the island, which started from about 1928, and the reduction of the imports and exports, it has been necessary to appeal to the Imperial Government for several grants and loans-in-aid. These have assisted conditions greatly and as a result there are already signs that the productivity of the island is on the increase.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was separated from the colony of the Leeward Islands and grouped with the Windward Islands.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but blight and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. Banana growing has recently assumed considerable importance. The soil is good and the climate healthy. Limes and cocoa flourish throughout the coastal zone. The former were almost wiped out by root disease a few years ago, but trees, budded on resistant stocks, have since been extensively planted, and exports of lime products are now increasing. The higher slopes in the centre of the island are well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, oranges, nutmegs, spices and such tropical fruits as require humid conditions.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power. Lime juice, cocoa, coconuts, copra, rum, tobacco, vanilla and fruit (including green limes, grape fruit, oranges, mangoes, bananas and avocado pears), are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, is no longer made. Trade is carried on also in spices, oils and timber.

The chief town, Roseau, is a port of registry. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1915.

There is a Government telephone system with six exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

Roseau, Portsmouth and nine villages have a piped water supply.

The local government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an act abrogating itself and substituting the crown colony system. A Legislative Council was created, consisting of 12 members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. Ordinance No. 21 of 1924 provided for the election of four of the unofficial members of the Council with the Administrator presiding in the absence of the Governor from the presidency. As a result of the report of the Closer Union Commission which visited Dominica among other West Indian islands in 1932, the Secretary of State approved of a further change in the constitution of the island to provide for the creation of a new Legislative Council with an unofficial majority, subject to certain safeguards, being left in the hands of the Governor. This change was effected under Ordinance No. 8 of 1936, which was brought into force by proclamation on 15th December, 1936, and provides for a Legislative Council consisting of the Administrator as president, with a casting vote only, two official members, three nominated members and five elected members. The first meeting of the Council under the new constitution was held on 10th May, 1937.
A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1298, 1902 and Cd. 3990, 1932).

**Population**

**Customs Tariff**

The rates of duty under the customs tariff are mainly specific. A preferential reduction varying in amount, but in most cases amounting to one-third of the general rate, is accorded to Empire products. The *ad valorem* duty on most articles is 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. That on jewellery, plate and plated ware is 20 per cent. and 30 per cent., and that on perfumery is 50 per cent. and 62½ per cent.

GRENADE

SITUATION AND AREA

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. latitude, and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. longitude; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 24th April, 1921) of 7,104.

CLIMATE

The climate is good and during the months from December to the end of April, when the trade winds prevail, it is delightful. From July to October there is greater humidity and higher temperature with little variation between night and day. The climate may be regarded as hot during this period but it is not unhealthy at any time during the year. There is an appreciable variation of rainfall.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and seven miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former there is a Government rest house. The island is well equipped with roads. All the first-class roads and practically all the second and third-class roads are suitable for motor traffic. Bitumen-surfaced first-class roads run completely round the island and across it in two directions. A large proportion of the second-class roads are also surface treated and all roads leading to places of interest are all-weather roads. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark and St. John—while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a District Officer. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping. Its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of good quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call for steamers.

The other towns in the colony are Gouyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Pauvre), Sauteurs, Grenville (or La Baye), and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken. French patois used to be spoken by the peasantry but the practice is declining rapidly. About 2 per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race.

POPULATION

1946 (census) . . . 72,374

HISTORY

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims. In 1762 it was surrendered to the British under Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on 10th February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D’Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1795–6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated by the French Republic. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred by the rebels and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established in regard to the African slaves, and this was followed in 1838 by their unconditional emancipation.
CONSTITUTION

There was from 1766 a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 21 elected members.

Under an Act of 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of 7th October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 members, eight elected by the people, and nine nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of five members, three being nominated and the other two elected Members of Assembly. These members received each a salary of £100 a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on 9th February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and crown colony government was established in December, 1877.

On 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

Until 1st December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

By an Order-in-Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, seven ex officio members, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members. The island was divided into five electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

By an Order-in-Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted; and now consists of the Governor, three ex officio members (the Administrator Attorney-General and Treasurer), four nominated members and seven elected members (one for each of seven electoral districts). At the same time, the Governor is given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government. By an Order-in-Council dated 11th May, 1945, the title of Colonial Secretary was altered to that of Administrator.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards.

EDUCATION

There are 53 elementary schools, 11 Government and 42 aided. These schools are Senior, Combined and Junior. There are in addition three handicraft centres for boys and three housecraft centres for girls. Additional facilities for handicraft and housecraft instruction are provided in such new schools as Grand Roy Government and River Sallee Government. Government Schools are maintained entirely out of public funds, whilst in aided schools teachers' salaries are paid by Government, and grants are given in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. Certificated teachers are paid basic salaries ranging from £60 to £300 per annum, according to their certificate of proficiency and length of service. All certificated teachers also receive a house allowance of ten per cent. of their basic salaries. Teachers in charge of schools are paid in addition a charge pay of £24 or £48 per annum, according to the size of the school. Bonuses are given them for extra duties. A Board of Education nominated by the Governor gives advice to Government in educational matters. There is a Government secondary school for boys. There are four private secondary schools—two for girls, one for boys, and one mixed. Two of these receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue.

SHIPPING ENTERED AND CLEARED

INDUSTRY, TRADE AND CUSTOMS

The prosperity of the Island, like that of its neighbours, depends entirely on agriculture. The chief export products are cocoa and nutmegs, followed by coconuts, spices, lime oil and other minor items. The dependency of Carriacou exports marie galante or short-staple cotton and lime oil. Sugar and rum are manufactured locally but production cannot yet equal the demand which has to be met by imports. A wide range of tropical fruit, vegetables, and food crops is grown in the Colony and encouragement is now being given to the livestock industry. Conservation forestry, aimed at the protection of the Island's main resources, is receiving attention.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware.

The tariff of import duties is partly on an ad valorem and partly on a specific basis. The rates in the case of the former are mainly 15 per cent. on Empire goods and 22½ per cent. on foreign goods. The preference on Empire goods is generally 3¾ per cent.

The total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, is 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,467.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889.

A co-operative bank was established in 1932, but there is no agricultural bank in the colony.
