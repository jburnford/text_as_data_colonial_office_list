### Federation of Malaya

**Situation and Area**

The territories comprising the Federation of Malaya are situated in the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the southeastern corner of Asia between India and China, between latitudes 1° and 7° N. and longitudes 100° and 105° E. The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,850 square miles, rather more than twice the size of the island of Ceylon, and slightly larger than England without Wales. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang, which is twice the area of Lancashire and Yorkshire combined, and the smallest is the State of Perlis, which is about twice the size of Rutland.

The State of Perlis lies on the north-west coast of the Peninsula and is bounded by a range of mountains running north and south, which separates it from the Siamese province of Setul. On the east the boundary is with the Siamese province of Nakon Sridhammaraj and the Malay State of Kedah, which is bordered on the interior by the Siamese States of Songkhla and Patani and by the State of Perak. The Muda River separates it from Province Wellesley.

The State of Perak stretches south from Province Wellesley, Kedah and Siam and is separated from Kelantan and Pahang on the east by the main range of mountains that form the backbone of the Peninsula. On the south, the Bernam River separates the State from Selangor, which is bordered on the east by the State of Pahang and on the south by the State of Negri Sembilan.

Stretching north on the east coast between the northern border of Pahang and the Siamese boundary lie the two States of Trengganu and Kelantan.

In the extreme south of the Malay Peninsula lies the State of Johore. Four-fifths of the surface of the Peninsula is covered by dense tropical jungle. The only generally cleared parts of the country are the long stretches down the west coast, an area in the north and a number of open stretches up the principal rivers. The State of Trengganu, for example, is divided into sixteen river basins, all of which empty into the China Sea.

### Climate

The principal features of the Malayan climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and
winter of Northern latitudes. The months between these two seasons, which correspond with spring and autumn of Northern latitudes, are the wettest months over most parts of Malaya. Coastal districts, however, have their own peculiar rainy seasons.

Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year, though the annual fall varies considerably from place to place and year to year. Jelebu, in Negri Sembilan, is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches and Maxwell's Hill the wettest with 198 inches a year.

The average maximum temperature in the plains is rather less than 90° F. and minimum about 70° F. At hill stations temperatures are considerably lower; at Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 79° F. and 36° F. and at Fraser's Hill 81° F. and 53° F.

The nights are reasonably cool everywhere, and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not obtained at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative, and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate becomes imperative if health is to be maintained.

The highest temperature recorded during 1949 was 98° F. which occurred at Kangar on 28th March. The lowest temperature recorded in the plains was 65° F. at several places on various dates.

**General Description**

The Kra Peninsula is divided by mountain ranges, the principal trend of which is north and south. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80 per cent. of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp, 14 per cent. under rubber, 2·4 per cent. under padi and 2·1 per cent. under coconuts and oil palms.

The Malay rivers at their sources and in their upper reaches are quick flowing, often with tortuous rapids and precipitous gorges.

In the lower reaches, the descent is more gradual and the water takes on a muddy hue from contamination with the silt of the plains through which they meander, debouching ultimately through strips of mangrove swamp, particularly on the west coast.

The two principal rivers of the Peninsula are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter being some ten miles shorter than the River Thames. It springs in the main range of mountains, the highest of which is Gunong Tahan, which rises to over 7,000 feet at its summit. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory south of the Himalayas, while there are half a dozen promenices which would comfortably overshadow Ben Nevis. That part of the country free from the torrid luxuriance of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other stretches have been scarred by the incisions of industry as in the Kinta Valley of Perak, which opens out into a monotonous prospect of silver-grey silt, the residuum of tin extraction.

The coast-line of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of picturesque bays fringed with coconut palms and the graceful spires of the casuarina. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand and surf bordered by a littoral vegetation which lends to it a beauty possibly unparalleled in the tropics.

Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands off the North Kedah coast rising to over 2,000 feet wrapped in wild and rugged beauty. Farther south there is the island of Penang, picturesque in a different way, whose features have been eulogised by travellers from the earliest histories. The island of Pangkor off the coast of Perak was once a Dutch settlement, but little remains in evidence of this history beneath the vegetation, which has long since reclaimed its own.

Finally, off the east coast among a sprinkle of beautiful islands there is Tioman with its symbolic silhouette of granite peaks.

**Population**

Population statistics are estimated half-yearly. Since December, 1947, they have been based on the census taken in September of that year, plus migrational surplus plus the excess of births over deaths. The most recent figures of the estimated population compiled in December, 1949, showed a population of 5,158,687 in the Federation. This excludes transient categories which have not been estimated since 1947, when the census gave the figure as 52,837, which included 3,460 transients afloat, 38,379 service personnel in service establishment, 8,911 Japanese surrendered personnel, and 2,087 unlocated personnel. This later population figure represents an increase of 5·2 per cent. over the 1947 census. The Federation is 50,850 square miles in area, and the mean population density at the end of 1949 was, therefore, approximately 102 per square mile, as compared with approximately 97 in September, 1947. The European population has risen from 9,607 to 11,649, an increase of 21·3 per cent. The other races increased approximately in proportion to their numbers, the percentage increase of Eurasians being 6·9 per cent., Indians 5·5 per cent., Chinese 5·1 per cent. and Malaysians 6·0 per cent. Of the total population of the Federation 49·4 per cent. are Malaysians, 38·4 per cent. Chinese, 10·9 per cent. Indians and Pakistanis, 0·2 per cent. Eurasians, 0·2 per cent. Europeans, and 0·9 per cent. other races.

The following figures show comparative increases and decreases since 1947, by races:

|                | Indians | Chinese | Pakistanis | Others |
|----------------|---------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1947           | 2,427,834 | 1,884,534 | 530,638    | 65,080 |
| 1949           | 2,549,082 | 1,980,205 | 559,748    | 69,652 |

Population by States in the Federation in December, 1949, was as follows:

- Penang: 467,789
- Malacca: 254,178
- Perak: 1,006,038
- Selangor: 733,129
- Negri Sembilan: 283,987
- Pahang: 261,293
- Johore: 784,695
- Kedah: 582,838
- Kelantan: 459,684
- Trengganu: 230,979
- Perlis: 74,077

Total: 5,158,687
RELIGION

The Muslim religion is practised by the Malays, who are Sunni Muslims of the Shafi'i School. The Malay Rulers are the titular religious heads of their Muslim subjects in each State. The Muslim community also includes a number of the local Indian population and a lesser number of persons of other races.

There are Christian churches in most of the larger towns of Malaya and the Christian community includes an appreciable number of local Asians.

Hinduism is the religion of the majority of the Indian labourers and of a large number of the local Indian population of all classes, including the Chettiar.

Buddhism is practised by a section of the Chinese and Indian communities and by the small Siamese groups. The Sikh community follow the religious belief of that name.

Amongst the Chinese population may be found a variety of beliefs which include Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, with the addition of the worship of a number of local deities.

Little is known of the beliefs of the primitive aboriginal tribes of the interior, but they are said to practise forms of Shamanism and Animism.

HISTORY

European power in Malaya may be dated from 1511, when a Portuguese fleet captured Malacca; it succeeded to periods of Indian and Islamic influence. Indian traders from the Coromandel coast, arriving in the Peninsula in about the first century A.D., found the aboriginal inhabitants living by fishing and the most primitive agriculture. The Indians, beginning to settle in the country and intermarry with the aborigines, built the first towns; the chief one, which stood on the River Merbok in Kedah, was known in Malay records as Langkasuka. Eventually there emerged an Indo-Malayan kingdom called Sri-Vijaya, of which the capital was at one time at Palembang in Sumatra, but may later have been at Langkasuka. This Indian influence, which had replaced the aboriginal tribal organisation by the rule of Rajas, had disseminated Buddhism, and had added to the Malay language a large number of Sanskrit words, together with the Indian alphabets, lasted until about the fifteenth century, when Muslim missionaries began to undermine it. Indians, Persians and Arabians, they had come to Sumatra a century earlier, and soon spread to the Peninsula. By the seventeenth century Indian culture and religion had yielded to those of Islam; the Arabic alphabet was introduced, Arabic words came into the language, and Indian aesthetics gave place to Muslim austerity. A great part in this process was played by Iskander Muda, Sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra, whose piratical hordes swept through Malaya, massacring and pillaging, and at the same time compelling conversion to Islam at the point of the sword. Meanwhile European power was beginning. The Portuguese in Malacca succeeded a Malay kingdom which, founded by a dispossessed ruler of Tumasik (the modern Singapore), had extended its sway over much of the peninsula. They held Malacca from 1511 to 1641, when they were dispossessed by the Dutch. The Portuguese were crusaders even more than traders, and made themselves detested by the Malays by their compulsory conversions to Christianity. In contrast, the Dutch concerned themselves almost entirely with trade during their 150 years of rule in Malacca, jealously guarding their monopoly of the tin and spice trades. But neither the Portuguese nor the Dutch extended their rule beyond the town of Malacca. It was to break the Dutch trading monopoly that the British first settled in Malaya. Francis Light, in 1786, obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795, during the Napoleonic wars; it served as a base for the successful attack on Dutch Java by Lord Minto and Sir Stamford Raffles. Raffles became Lieutenant-Governor of Java; but in 1814 Java and Malacca alike were handed back to the Dutch. Raffles, with his far-seeing vision, held this to be a grave mistake, and by continued representations to the company secured permission to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. He obtained a concession from the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore, and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. Raffles' vision was proved not only by his choice of a site, but by his determination to make it a free port. With these two advantages Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the Entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands as the third of the Straits Settlements in 1824, when by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London Malaya was recognised as a British sphere of influence. Raffles strongly favoured British expansion in Malaya; but after his early death in 1826 the parsimonious conservatism of the East India Company frowned on such a policy. However, in 1838 the Straits Settlements came under the control of the India Office, and in 1867 of the Colonial Office, while such factors as the danger to the British position latent in the huge concessions of land granted at this time by the Sultans to Europeans and others, the growing interest in the tin, and subsequently rubber, which could be obtained from Malaya, and a deterioration of the political situation of the Malay States into civil war and disorder, hastened the extension of British authority in the Peninsula. In 1873 Sir Andrew Clarke, the new Governor of the Straits, came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan, and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam, after long negotiations, transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern states, and there resulted agreements in the same year with Kedah, Kelantan and Perlis, and in 1919 with Trengganu. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were in their main features similar: the Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in return guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each state a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the rulers agreed to follow on all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The early residents were faced with great difficulties. The new methods of raising revenue which became necessary to finance the development of the country aroused great hostility, to which the forbidding of slavery and of forced labour added. There were risings in Perak in 1874 and in Pahang in 1891-1892. In time, however, the residents, by patience and
conciliation, overcame these difficulties; and the foundations laid by such early residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories of the Colonial Empire. Politically, the main change in the early years of the century was the formation of the Federated Malay States. Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a federation with a resident general as chief executive officer, and a system of centralised government was inaugurated which lasted in varying forms until 1932. In that year there was a measure of decentralisation; legislative powers were to some extent restored to the states and the authority of the rulers and residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt halt during Japanese occupation from December, 1941, to August, 1945.

During the period of British military administration Sir Harold MacMichael negotiated with Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers new agreements under which they transferred full sovereignty and jurisdiction to His Majesty the King, thereby opening the way for the establishment of the Malayan Union by Order in Council on 1st April, 1946. It had been planned at the same time to establish a form of common citizenship, but, in view of the strong objections put forward by the Malays to the form of these proposals, the Order in Council which would have given effect to them was not made. The Malays also objected to the transfer of sovereignty, and feared domination by the non-Malay communities as a result of the proposed new citizenship. On 25th July, 1946, a working committee, consisting of representatives of Government, of Their Highnesses the Rulers, and of the United Malays' National Organisation, was appointed to submit agreed views, if possible, for both sides to examine and criticise. Its Report, published in December, 1946, recommended a federation in which each state and settlement would retain its individuality under a strong central government; and qualifications for a form of common citizenship. These proposals received the conditional approval of His Majesty's Government on 11th December, 1946. To enable all interested communities to have free and full opportunity of expressing their views a Consultative Committee was appointed, composed mainly of influential members of the non-Malay communities. After receiving oral and written representations throughout the country the Consultative Committee published its report on 31st March, 1947. After further discussion with Their Highnesses the Rulers and the representatives of U.M.N.O., the scheme which finally emerged, and which followed in the main that proposed in December, 1946, although differing on several important points of detail, was finally accepted by His Majesty's Government in July, 1947, when its main features were summarised in a White Paper (Cmd. 7171). The signature of agreements between His Majesty and each Malay Ruler, and of a Federation Agreement to embrace the arrangements as a whole, followed on 21st January, 1948, and the new Constitution came into force on 1st February, 1948.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Federation of Malaya, which succeeded the Malayan Union, came into being on 1st February, 1948, on the conclusion of the Federation of Malaya Agreement between His Majesty the King and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States. The Federation consists of the nine Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Trengganu and the two British settlements of Penang and Malacca. His Majesty the King and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States have power to admit any other territory into the Federation by mutual agreement. Under the Federation Agreement there is a Conference of Rulers, which is consulted on matters of special concern to the Malay States and in particular on immigration policy.

The Central Government, which was set up under the Federation Agreement, and to which legislation on matters of importance to the whole country is reserved, consists of a High Commissioner appointed by His Majesty, a Federal Executive Council, and a Federal Legislative Council. The Legislative Council consists of 75 members: 14 official and ex officio, the 9 Menteri Besar or chief ministers of the Malay States, 2 representing the Settlement Councils, and 50 unofficial, these last nominated on a mainly non-racial basis to represent important vocations and interests. New legislation is enacted jointly by the High Commissioner and Their Highnesses the Rulers. The new provisions concerning citizenship are summarized in Cmd. 7171.

Each State is governed under a written Constitution by its Ruler assisted by a State Executive Council and a Council of State, and each Settlement has a Settlement Council. His Majesty the King, through the High Commissioner, exercises control over questions of defence and external relations.

The Federation Agreement also records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress shall be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as circumstances permit for the election of members to the several legislatures established under the Agreement.

**ADMINISTRATION**

Under the Federal constitution the executive authority in each State is vested in the Ruler, who is aided and advised by his Executive Council; it extends to all matters not included in the Federal legislative list. The Councils of State and the Settlement Councils have legislative powers in such matters as are not reserved for the Federal authority. The Federation estimates provide separately for the income and expenditure of each of the States and Settlements, and for block grants from Federal revenue to make up the deficiency of their own revenues.

The seat of the Federal Government is at Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of most Federal Departments and of the Military Command (Malaya District). In each state there is a British Adviser as adviser to the State Government and officers of the various Federal departments who, while being responsible to the heads of their own departments, work closely with State officers. Most of the administrative officers in districts are Asians trained in Malaya.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

The demand for education continues to increase, and with it the demand for still more school accommodation and more teachers, at a time when emergency measures must have first claim on the
finances of the country. Every school building is filled to capacity and in many cases two sessions are run in the same building. This pressure on accommodation and the need for more teachers is found in the vernacular as well as the English schools. The present number of pupils enrolled in all schools is 638,000 which shows an increase of 56,700 over the figure for 1949, and an increase of 375,000, or 142 per cent., over the enrolment immediately prior to the recent world war.

Primary education in the vernacular is given in Malay, Chinese and Indian vernacular schools, the combined number of which is now 3,784. The great majority of the Malay schools are entirely supported by Government whilst the Chinese and Indian schools receive a Government subsidy. In the Malay schools, and most of the Indian schools no fees are charged. The Chinese schools are mainly managed by Committees of the Chinese community. The Indian schools are mostly small schools on rubber estates, though larger schools are conducted in the towns by Government and by Committees of Indian residents. The present enrolment in the three types of vernacular schools is, Malay 278,000, Chinese 220,000, Indian, 41,000. All three types of vernacular schools are regularly inspected by Government officers.

The English schools, that is, schools where the medium of instruction is English, number 239. They are mostly secondary in scope though many of them have primary schools attached. Pupils of all races are admitted—some directly and some from the vernacular schools, in many cases without fees being required, and receive education up to school certificate standard. An increasing number of English schools have post certificate courses which will lead to the higher certificate and it is certain that the demand for these higher classes will increase. The chief obstacle to the rapid expansion of these courses is the shortage of suitable staff. The Malay College for boys at Kuala Kangsar, and the Malay Girls’ College at Kuala Lumpur are residential schools, following the secondary school curriculum of the English schools.

Higher education in Malaya was formerly provided by the King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College and is now provided in the newly formed University of Malaya in Singapore, which conducted its first degree examinations in 1950. Numerous scholarships are available for selected students to study in the United Kingdom and other overseas centres. In the Federation, the Technical College at Kuala Lumpur provides a variety of three year technical courses, and the College of Agriculture at Serdang provides courses in agriculture with special reference to local problems.

Malay vernacular teachers are trained at the Sultan Idris Training College and the Malay Women’s Training College, whilst for pupil teachers who cannot gain admission to these colleges there are non-residential training classes which give a three-year course. Teachers in English schools receive training in a non-residential three-year normal course, whilst teachers in Chinese and Indian schools attend non-residential training classes for three years. A new series of training classes has been started for teachers of English in vernacular schools, and these classes are likely to expand considerably.

Information Services

Since the liberation of Malaya, a Department of Public Relations has been established, charged with responsibility for the presentation of accurate factual information regarding Government policy to the people of Malaya.

Diversities of race, language, religion and custom, together with the illiteracy of the majority of the population, present difficulties. The Department makes considerable use of mobile public address and cinema units as a method of reaching rural audiences. More than 2,400,000 people were addressed in 1949. Simple publications in Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil have begun the bridging of the gap between the publication of Government Enactments in English and their understanding by the local people. Pioneer work has been done in conjunction with the Trade Union Adviser’s Department in preparing simple pamphlets in vernacular languages on trades unionism and allied matters of importance to the workers.

Publicity in connection with the Emergency has been undertaken by the Department on a considerable scale.

Health

The climate of Malaya is healthy but monotonously warm, with a high humidity.

The general health of the country has greatly improved in the last three years and is almost at pre-war level.

The latest developments in the treatment and prophylaxis of important tropical diseases such as malaria and tropical typhus are closely followed and put into practice.

The post-war increase in the incidence of tuberculosis has given rise to schemes to combat this disease. Epidemic smallpox is now under control and practically eradicated. Seventy-two General and District Hospitals, in which 13,124 beds are provided, are maintained by Government, as well as institutions for persons suffering from leprosy, mental diseases, infectious diseases; also V.D. clinics and dental clinics. One hundred and forty-six private hospitals with 5,992 beds are maintained on rubber estates. In the larger towns, housing shortage is a serious problem and water supplies are treated according to modern methods. Sewage disposal by domestic septic tanks is the practice in use in suburban areas, but conservancy methods are a feature of the built-up areas. Malaria is controlled in towns and villages by anti-larval methods.

The treatment of the rural population is carried out by means of fixed and travelling dispensaries and welfare clinics. 2,625,214 patients were treated either as out-patients or in-patients during 1949.

Child Welfare Centres are established in all the densely populated parts of the country.

The Institute for Medical Research deals with a wide range of investigations, amongst which those on tropical typhus, malaria and nutritional problems are the most prominent.

Labour

The main feature of 1949, as compared with other years since the war was its freedom from industrial disputes and strikes. Wage levels throughout the Federation for all categories of workers attained a high degree of uniformity and stability and were generally static throughout the year.

The over-riding reason for the year’s industrial peace was the Emergency. At the beginning of 1948 there were 289 trade unions in the Feder-
tion with a total membership of 198,713. Nearly half of these unions were under the direct control of the Communist Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions. With the onset of the Emergency the P.M.F.T.U. junta and all its ancillaries appropriated the substantial funds they had extorted from the workers and took to the jungle. By the end of 1949 the number of trade unions had fallen to 169 and total membership to 42,288, and of these 169 unions 6 were employers' unions with a membership of 983 and 70 were closed unions of Government employees with a membership of 20,142. Those unions which did survive the debacle of the P.M.F.T.U. have had a hard and continuous and by no means wholly successful struggle to maintain their organisation intact.

However, it is reasonable to suppose that, once the Emergency is over, the politically minded in all quarters will show revived interest in labour and in trade unionism; and when that happens the present industrial peace must unavoidably give way to the healthy canvassing of demands for better conditions for working people. It is hoped that the existing unions which have been purged, in the main, of their undesirable elements, and also the employers, will realise that negotiations in the future will be facilitated, and are only likely to be successful, when mutual respect has been built up by both sides. Meanwhile the Emergency continues. What it has meant, throughout the year and from day to day, to all those working on plantations or in mines or dredges over large areas of the Federation must not be forgotten. The employers have carried on under the immense strain of a constant vigilance against possible armed attack upon the properties for which they are responsible, upon their workers or upon themselves. Their fortitude has most deservedly received wide recognition. Perhaps the plight of the worker, especially of the Chinese and Indian worker, has by comparison been a little overlooked. He has often been subject to continuous pressure from and extortion by the terrorists; often, as an unavoidable consequence, he has suffered counter pressure from the police or military and has become the object of their suspicion. At best, his daily movements have been controlled and sometimes drastically restricted. That he has almost always gone about his work cheerfully has seldom meant that he has been free from fear. The number of workers who have lost their lives has, it is true, been relatively small; but many have had, for security reasons, to endure the discomforts of "resettlement", and some hundreds of others in all parts of the country, but most markedly in Johore and Perak, have lost by bandit action the homes with which their employers had provided them.

Welfare

During the year 1949 the Department of Social Welfare has steadily developed its technical services and was able to expand its work in rural areas. Training courses for officers and local recruits to the services are producing excellent results. The reports from the United Kingdom on the progress of the scholars in training are encouraging. Four trained scholars returned from the United Kingdom during the year. Voluntary organisations have extended their activities towards greater interest in special fields of welfare particularly in the campaign against anti-tuberculosis, and in building up blind welfare services and youth organisations.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

The road system of Malaya, exclusive of minor approach road, is 5,958·65 miles in length composed of the following mileages and types of road:

| Class | Description | Mileage |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| A     | Concrete surface | 19·11   |
|       | Metalled surface, grouted or sealed with bitumen | 3,932·74 |
| B     | Metalled surface, water bound | 327·42 |
| C     | Hard surface, bitumen sealed | 216·90 |
| D     | Hard surface, waterbound | 799·81 |
| E     | Earth surface | 662·67 |

5,958·65

The Federal Government is responsible for the maintenance of 2,129·18 miles of road, including, in general, all the main through routes, roads serving the principal ports, roads in a stage of preliminary development and roads which are considered principally to be of strategic value, the remaining 3,829·47 miles of road being maintained by the respective Governments of States or Settlements in which the roads are situated.

During 1949, 845·48 miles of road were re-metalled, hard surface or bitumen sealed and the programme of gradual replacement of old and unserviceable bridges and culverts was continued.

The expenditure on maintenance of the 5,296 miles of metalled roads amounted to $17,874,900 giving an average cost of $3,375 per mile.

Rail

The railway system which is government-owned serves Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. The track is of metre-gauge. From Singapore Island the railway crosses to the mainland by the Johore Causeway. The main line then runs roughly parallel to the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula, but at some distance inland, to Prai on the west coast, opposite the Island of Penang. This main west coast line is 488 miles long. From Bukit Mertajam (5 miles south of Prai), a line branches off the main line and continues in a northerly direction to the Thai frontier at Padang Besar, the junction with the Royal State Railways of Thailand (Siam), 99 miles from Bukit Mertajam. Lines branch from the main line to serve railway-operated wharves at Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson and Port Weld. A branch line, 22 miles long, which connected the port of Malacca with the main line, was removed by the Japanese during their 3½ years of occupation, and has not yet been replaced.

The East Coast Line branches from the main line at Gemas, 137 miles from Singapore, and runs in a northerly direction through the States of Negri Sembilan, Pahang and Kelantan, and terminates at the port of Tumpat on the east coast close to the Thai border. The distance from Gemas to Tumpat is 327 miles. At Pasir Mas, 16 miles south of Tumpat, a branch line 13 miles long runs west to connect with the Royal State Railways of Thailand at the border station of Sungei Golok.

The Japanese removed a length of 200 miles of the East Coast Line between Mentakab (Pahang) and Sungei Kusial (Kelantan). A distance of 27 miles of this line southwards from Sungei Kusial has been restored and re-opened to traffic,
and a further 20 miles has been relaid. Restoration northwards from Mentakab has been completed for a distance of 32 miles as far as Jerantut, but further work beyond this station has been suspended on account of the general state of Emergency.

A through service is run once a week between Prai and Bandkok, the Thai capital.

Buffet cars and sleeping saloons are provided on the night mail trains between Prai and Singapore, and air-conditioned buffet cars are attached to the Kuala Lumpur-Prai day mail trains.

Shipping

The two principal ports are Penang and Port Swettenham.

That of Penang, which is situated some 400 miles from the southern tip of Malaya serves the northern part of the country, whilst Port Swettenham which is centrally situated on the western shore serves the central part of Malaya which includes the town of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation.

During 1949 the tonnage of ocean-going vessels using the ports showed progressive increase. The total number and tonnage of ships that entered and cleared the Ports of Penang, Port Swettenham and Malacca during 1949 was as follows:

| Country          | Craft | Tonnage |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| Penang           |       | 3,415   |
| P. Swettenham    |       | 2,009   |
| Malacca          |       | 225     |
| Total            |       | 5,649   |

| Country          | Craft | Tonnage |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| Penang           |       | 9,598,956|
| P. Swettenham    |       | 6,669,155|
| Malacca          |       | 100,632 |
| Total            |       | 16,368,743|

Country Craft

| Country          | Craft | Tonnage |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| Penang           |       | 7,431   |
| P. Swettenham    |       | 10,208  |
| Malacca          |       | 2,813   |
| Total            |       | 20,452  |

| Country          | Craft | Tonnage |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| Penang           |       | 398,750 |
| P. Swettenham    |       | 116,350 |
| Malacca          |       | 50,631  |
| Total            |       | 565,731 |

The navigational aids around the Federation coast line which extends from Langkawi Island on the West Coast to Tumpat in Kelantan on the East Coast, a distance of some 800 miles, operated efficiently during 1949.

Direct services to and from the United Kingdom are provided by the main shipping companies on the Far Eastern Service. Regular coastal services between the minor ports of Malaya and ports in South East Asia are provided by the Straits Steamship Company.

Air

The International Airline Operating Companies which include B.O.A.C., Qantas and K.L.M., provide scheduled services between Singapore and the continents of Europe and Australia. In addition, air services connect Singapore with capitals in the Netherlands East Indies, Siam, French Indo-China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Burma, India and Ceylon.

Malaya is provided with a very efficient domestic air service operated by Malayan Airways, Ltd., who, in addition to running daily services between Singapore and centres in the Federation, operate frequent schedules to Sarawak and N. Borneo and to points in the N.E.I. and Siam.

Projected services in South-East Asia which will affect Malaya include routes from Singapore to Shanghai (via Bangkok and Hong Kong) and to Manila via Borneo.

Although modern aerodromes, telecommunications and navigational aid equipment are still in short supply, the air routes at present being operated in this region are provided with the minimum ground organisation required to maintain the safe operation of all these services.

The international and domestic air services operating through Malaya have surpassed considerably the services available to the general public at the outbreak of the last war, and they will increase and expand still further during the coming year.

The completion of the new International Airport at Tengah will go far towards enabling Singapore to maintain its position as a focal point of trade communications in South East Asia.

Posts

The Malayan Postal Union comprises the territories of the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore.

Mails between Malaya and nearly all major countries are exchanged by air and sea at frequent intervals.

The total number of postal articles dealt with in 1949 was 155,020,862.

There are 205 post offices and 117 Postal Agencies.

Facilities for the transmission of money are available by means of money order and postal order inland and foreign services.

The total cash turn-over in 1949 was $472,745,517.

Savings Bank facilities are available and a total amount of $74,692,981 remained at the credit of depositors at 31st December, 1949.

Telecommunications

The Telecommunications Department Malaya is a pan-Malayan Department serving the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore except in so far as the local telephone services of Singapore and Johore Bahru are concerned, which are operated by a private company.

There are telegraph services throughout Malaya and links with Cable and Wireless, Ltd. There are over 200 telephone exchanges throughout the Peninsula.

The United Kingdom-Malaya Radio Telephone Service was re-introduced on 22nd May, 1950, while the establishment of a similar service with other countries is in hand.

Subsidiary services for which the Department is responsible include Ship-Shore, Police and Civil Aviation Radio and the signal and telegraph service for the Malayan Railway.

Broadcasting

The Federation of Malaya is at present served by broadcasting stations located at Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca, radiating medium wave programmes in the English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil languages. These stations originate talks of local interest and entertainment programmes and feed special programmes into the network of Radio-Malaya. Each station also relays the news bulletins, special features and talks and broadcasts for schools radiated on shortwave over the whole of the Peninsula by transmitters of the Department of Broadcasting located in Singapore. A 5 KW shortwave transmitter was put into
operation from Kuala Lumpur at the end of 1949 and two 10 KW medium wave transmitters should be in operation from Kuala Lumpur by the end of 1950. The installation of these transmitters will give wider coverage of Malaya from the Federation capital and it is the ultimate aim of the Department to give good medium-wave listening to all the main centres of population in Malaya. It is planned during 1950 to install community listening facilities throughout the country with the assistance of a grant under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945.

**PUBLIC FINANCE**

**Revenue and Expenditure**

Under the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, each of the nine States and two Settlements are responsible for expenditure pertaining to its own particular needs as regards its administration, schools, health services, water supplies, Town Board services, etc., while the Federal Government is responsible for the expenditure on the overall administration of the country, Police, Prisons, Customs, Postal Services, Telecommunications, Training Colleges, Tuberculosis Settlements and similar services and institutions. The States and Settlements receive their revenue from entertainments duty, water rates, Town Board and Rural Board Charges, certain licences and fees of Court, land, forest and mine revenue, etc. In addition, the States and Settlements receive an allocation from the Federal Government to meet normal services not met from revenue and for development.

The total amount of Estate Duty collected in the year 1949 was $3,502,418.

(d) Stamp Duties

Stamp Duties are collected under the Stamp Ordinance, 1949. The new ordinance became law in December and increased the duties on some instruments including cheques.

The main source of revenue from licences is that for motor vehicles which amounted to $8,669,373 during 1949 and is Federal Revenue. The licences of motor vehicles are based on horse power and type of engine and vary according to whether the vehicle is for private, public or load carrying purposes.

(f) Municipal

Municipal Revenue, which forms part of the revenue of the States and Settlements, consists of general assessment rates, specific fees and charge...
for services in Town Board areas. The municipal revenue in the municipal areas of Penang, Malacca and Kuala Lumpur is collected by the Municipal Commissioners and is not part of the revenue of the States and Settlements.

(g) Income Tax

The Income Tax Ordinance, 1947 (No. 48 of 1947) was brought into force on 15th December, 1947 (G.N.8337), and 1st January, 1948, was appointed as the date of commencement of the first year of assessment. In July, 1948, an amending bill designed to give effect to the recommendations of an Income Tax Joint Committee was introduced into the Legislative Council and was enacted as the Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, No. II of 1948. No amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance were made in 1949.

Owing to the close economic relations existing between the Federation and the Colony of Singapore it was considered essential that the tax should be operated on a pan-Malayan basis. The Federation and the Colony Ordinances are, therefore, in all but a few minor respects, identical, and it is provided that a taxpayer resident in either territory shall make one return of his combined income from the Federation and from the Colony, and that only one assessment shall be made on his income. The net proceeds of the tax collected in such cases up to and including 31st December, 1949, has been allocated between the two Governments.

The profits of companies are charged at a flat rate of 20 per cent.

In the case of individuals, $3,000 is deductible from assessable income if the individual is unmarried. A further allowance of $2,000 is made to a married man. Allowances are also made in respect of children up to nine in number, for life assurance premiums paid and for obligatory or contractual contributions to approved pension or provident funds.

The rate of tax on the chargeable income remaining after the above-mentioned allowances have been made varies from 3 per cent. on the first $500 of chargeable income to 30 per cent. on chargeable income in excess of $50,000, thus:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of Tax |
|-------------------|-------------|
| For every dollar of the first $500 | 3% |
| For every dollar of the next $500 | 4% |
| For every dollar of the next $500 | 5% |
| For every dollar of the next $500 | 6% |
| For every dollar of the next $1,000 | 7% |
| For every dollar of the next $2,000 | 8% |
| For every dollar of the next $3,000 | 10% |
| For every dollar of the next $5,000 | 12% |
| For every dollar of the next $35,000 | 20% |
| For every dollar exceeding $50,000 | 30% |

The receipts from Income Tax in 1949 amounted to $37,775,269 and of this sum, $5,415,800 was collected in Singapore on behalf of the Federation.

The Colonial Income Tax Office in London act as agents for the Federation Income Tax Department and assess and collect the tax payable by companies and individuals resident in the United Kingdom who elect to make their returns to the London Office.

A double taxation relief arrangement with the United Kingdom was made in 1949, and the relevant Order was gazetted as the Double Taxation (Relief) (United Kingdom) Order, 1949, on 27th April, 1949.

Currency and Banking

The legal currency of the Federation of Malaya is the Malayan dollar with a value of two shillings and four pence and divided into one hundred cents. The currency is issued by a Board of Commissioners of Currency which was established under an agreement signed in 1938 by the Governments of the Straits Settlements and the Malay States. The currency of the country is on a sterling exchange standard and the Commissioners are bound to issue on demand currency notes at the rate of one dollar for two shillings and four pence in exchange for sums in sterling lodged with the Crown Agents for the Colonies in London and to pay on demand the sterling equivalent of Malayan Currency notes lodged with them in Malaya. Under the law the Commissioners can charge commission at the rate of three-sixteenths of a penny for every dollar issued and one farthing in respect of every dollar received.

Provision is made for the establishment and maintenance of a Currency Fund, which is managed by the Board in such a way that its value shall normally stand at between one hundred and one hundred and ten per cent of the face value of the currency notes and coin in circulation. There is also provision for making each Government liable to meet any deficiency to the Fund should the assets at any time prove inadequate to meet legal demands upon the Currency Commissioners for the conversion of currency into sterling.

The currency in circulation consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
(a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners.
(b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.

(ii) Bank Notes issued prior to 1st October, 1923 by—
(a) The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.
(b) The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.

(iii) Silver dollars and half dollars.
(iv) Subsidiary silver coin.
(v) Nickel coin (5-cent pieces).
(vi) Copper coin.
(vii) Bronze coin.

(i) and (ii) above consist of notes in the following denominations:—$10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1, and subsidiary notes 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent.

By proclamations issued on 23rd August, 1948, under the currency legislation in force in the Colony of Singapore, the Settlements of Penang and Malacca and in the States of Kedah and Perlis, and by virtue of section 6 of the Currency Enactments in force in other States, all currency notes issued by and bearing the name of the Government of the Straits Settlements and all currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July, 1941, were declared to be no longer legal tender in the Federation after 31st August, 1948. Of these pre-invasion note issues amounting to $238,804,963-95 notes to the value of $227,656,077-49 had been withdrawn and destroyed by the Currency Commissioners by the end of 1949. The total nominal currency note circulation on 31st December, 1949, was $402,943,640-15.

Silver dollars, half dollars, subsidiary silver coin and nickel coin have almost entirely disappeared from circulation and no further issues of such coin are being made. Cupro-nickel coin in denominations of 20, 10 and 5 cents is now being minted.

Copper coin consists of denominations of 1-cent, ½-cent, and ¼-cent pieces and bronze coin of 1-cent and ½-cent pieces.

The total nominal circulation of coin on 31st December, 1949, was $30,974,088-36.

Banking and Credit

The undermentioned are the leading banks in the Federation. Those marked with an asterisk are banks incorporated here:—

Ban Hin Lee Bank, Ltd.
Bank of China.
*Batu Pahat Bank, Ltd.
Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.
Eastern Bank, Ltd.
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
Indian Bank, Ltd.
Indian Overseas Bank, Ltd.
*Kwong Yik (Selangor) Banking Corporation.
*Malay National Banking Corporation, Ltd.
Mercantile Bank of India, Ltd.
Netherlands Trading Society.
*Oriental Bank of Malaya, Ltd.
Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation, Ltd.
United Commercial Bank, Ltd.

In addition approximately 800 “Remittance Shops” operate under permit in the territory for the purpose of facilitating petty remittances to China, particularly to districts where no banking facilities are available.

There is no central bank in the Federation and therefore there is no official bank rate. The terms on which credit is offered, as well as the scale of charges for banking services, are fixed by the members of the Malayan Exchange Banks Association.

The following are comparative figures of Post Office Savings Bank transactions for the years 1948 and 1949. While the 1949 figures cover the Federation of Malaya, the 1948 figures exclude the Settlements of Penang and Malacca.

|                      | 1948   | 1949   |
|----------------------|--------|--------|
| Number of open accounts | 182,584 | 229,652 |
| Number of transactions | 360,878 | 430,107 |
| Liability to depositors exclusive of interest | $35,600,000 | $47,300,000 |
| Turnover              | $42,300,000 | $50,700,000 |

Foreign Exchange Control was inaugurated in the Federation of Malaya on 4th January, 1946, in conformity with the system already in force throughout the sterling area or “Scheduled Territories” as they are now known.

A feature of Exchange Control in Malaya is the system of allowing remittances by Chinese up to a limit of $45 per month for the maintenance of their families in China. This system is operated through remittance shops who undertake to collect money, write letters from the remitter to beneficiary, and through an agent in China deliver the money, write the acknowledgment at the dictation of the beneficiary, and deliver the reply. This concession represents a considerable export of resources to China, for which, from a Foreign Exchange viewpoint, no consideration is received in return. Such remittance shops are only
permitted to operate under permit issued by the Controller of Foreign Exchange and a substantial deposit or a bank's guarantee is required in order to afford protection of the remitters.

Another aspect which is of interest is the trade carried on between Malaya on the one hand and Sumatra, Java and the islands adjacent to Malaya on the other. This trade is known as "Chin Chew" trade and is a very important one in normal times, but during the period under review owing to the difficulties—political and otherwise in Sumatra—it has been restricted. The system operates in the following manner. A chin chew trader exports by Tongkang to an adjacent territory a cargo of Malayan goods and brings back a cargo of approximately the equivalent value of local produce. Alternatively, he may take with him a certain amount of Malayan money to non-Malayan territories in which Malayan currency circulates, and there purchase local produce which he brings to this country, sells and buys local produce acceptable in adjacent territories. Malayan currency may not, however, be exported to or imported from those parts of the N.E.I. which come within N.E.I. Customs jurisdiction. In such cases, any balance which cannot be settled by barter, may be transferred through banking channels."
