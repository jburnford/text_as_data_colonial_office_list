ADEN

ADEN COLONY

Situation and Area

The Colony of Aden is situated in latitude 12° 47' N. and longitude 45° 10' E. about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia.

The island of Perim in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb and the Kuria Muria Islands, five in number, off the Dhufar coast of Oman, also form part of the colony.

The total area of the Colony, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles, that of Aden proper, 21 square miles, and Little Aden 15 square miles. The flat strip of coast joining the peninsulas is about 39 square miles in extent.

Climate

The climate of Aden Colony is not unhealthy though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. During the south-west monsoon, i.e., in July and August, strong winds prevail which give some relief from the damp airless heat of May, June and September. Sandstorms are apt to occur in the months of May, June, July and August. These come from a northerly direction usually a short time before sunset and are often very intense, though of short duration. The weather during July and August is frequently very hazy, and it is not uncommon for ships to pass quite close to Aden without picking up the land. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent; but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

General Description

The Colony of Aden consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas joined by a flat sandy foreshore. Aden proper is on the south and Little Aden on the west. The peninsulas form the horns of Aden Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. On the west side of the Aden Peninsula is Steamer Point the principal military and port area.

The Aden Peninsula is arid, rocky and of volcanic formation and Jabal Shamsan, its summit, is 1,808 feet (551 m.) high. Crater, the main Arab town, is situated five miles from the main port and lies in the crater of the extinct volcano forming the peninsula.

The isthmus is a flat sandy plain, barely three-quarters of a mile wide at its narrowest point near the peninsula, joining the latter with the mainland and containing the colony's principal aerodrome.

Some cultivation occurs at Sheikh Othman, at the base of the isthmus, in a garden under the management of the Township Authority, but except during the cold weather months produce is very limited. There are also privately-owned date gardens there. Hiswa, on the shore of Aden Bay, has groves of toddy palms. Salt is manufactured in large quantities on the flat shores of the bay, by the process of open evaporation.

Perim Island, situated in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, is bare, rocky and flat: its highest point, about a mile northward of its southern extremity, is 214 feet (65 m.) high. The surface of the island is grooved with dry water courses and covered with coarse grass and stunted shrubs, the subsoil being sand and conglomerate coral. It possesses a good small harbour on the southwest side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth, and an emergency landing ground on the north side.

Population

The total population at the time of the census taken in October, 1946, was 80,516 (males, 50,589, females, 29,927).

The total population by the end of 1950 was probably 100,000.

Religion

The majority of the population is Moslem but there are communities of Jews, Hindus and Zoroastrians. There are two Anglican churches and two Roman Catholic churches, one of each situated in Steamer Point and Crater, and one Presbyterian and Methodist church in Steamer Point.

History

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. The Aden Peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the island in the same year. It was later reoccupied by the British in January, 1857, and placed under the control of an Assistant to the Political Resident at Aden. In 1929, the manager of the Perim Coal Company was appointed Government Agent, but on the closing down of that company in October, 1936, the Commissioner of Police, Aden, was appointed Administrator of the island. A police detachment is maintained at Perim.

Constitution

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden as from 1st April, 1937.
Under the Royal Instructions dated 3rd March, 1937, as subsequently amended by Additional Instructions dated 2nd July, 1940, and dated 3rd July, 1948, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the officers lawfully discharging the functions of Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed by His Majesty by any Instructions or Warrants under His Sign Manual and Signet, or as the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony, appoint in pursuance of instructions from His Majesty through one of His Principal Secretaries of State, or as the Governor may provisionally appoint in the manner provided in the Royal Instructions.

Whenever upon any special occasion the Governor desires to obtain the advice of any person within the Colony relating to affairs therein, he may summon such person, for such special occasion, as an Extraordinary Member of the Council.

Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which was brought into force from 24th October, 1946 a Legislative Council was constituted for the Colony of Aden.

The Council was inaugurated in January, 1947, and consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than four official members and not more than eight unofficial members.

The ex officio members are the senior officer for the time being in and stationed in the Colony in command of His Majesty's Regular Forces therein (excluding the Governor or officer administering the government of the Colony) and the persons for the time being lawfully discharging the functions of the respective offices of Chief Secretary, Attorney General and Financial Secretary of the Colony.

The official members are persons holding office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the above cited Order, are appointed by Instructions or Warrant under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, or by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in pursuance of His Majesty's Instructions through the Secretary of State.

The unofficial members are persons not holding office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony, and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the above cited Order, are appointed by Instructions or Warrant under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, or by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in pursuance of His Majesty's Instructions through the Secretary of State.

The Governor of the Colony is also Governor of the Aden Protectorate, which is not administered by the Colony Government. The Governor is empowered and commanded to exercise on His Majesty's behalf all such powers and jurisdiction as His Majesty now has, or may from time to time be enjoined upon him, in accordance with the Aden Protectorate Order, dated 18th March, 1937; as amended by Aden Protectorate (Amendment) Order, 1940 and the Aden Protectorate Royal Instructions dated 24th March, 1937.

ADMINISTRATION

The colony is administered by a Governor, who is also Commander-in-Chief, aided by an Executive Council which at present comprises six members.

There is no one Government for the Aden Protectorate. In each of the Western and Eastern protectorates the Governor is represented by a British agent who deals with the various Rulers and Treaty Chiefs on the basis of treaties concluded with them. The Protectorate includes the island of Socotra.

The administration of justice within the Colony is entrusted to the Supreme Court, a Court of Small Causes for certain specified civil cases and Magistrates courts for criminal cases. Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order in Council, 1947, appeals from the Supreme Court now lie to the Court of Appeal of Eastern Africa, and thence to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

The law of the Protectorate is largely tribal custom, but in certain chiefdoms the Shafai Code of Moslem law (Shari'a) is recognised, especially in the Qu'aiti State of Shehr and Mukalla (Ruler, His Highness Sultan Sir Saleh bin Ghalib al Qu'aiti, K.C.M.G.) which State legislates by published decrees.

Aden is a free port and there is no customs tariff. Excise duty is, however, levied on a specific duty basis on spirits, wines and beer, perfumed spirits, intoxicating and dangerous drugs, tobacco and motor spirit.

Under the Townships Ordinance, 1945, Township Authorities for the towns of Aden and Sheikh Othman were constituted, and the various municipal operations formerly carried out by the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement now devolve on the Township Authorities.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education in Aden Colony is under the control of the Director of Education. In the Eastern and Western Aden Protectorate it is, in common with other services, under the immediate general guidance of the British Agents. But the Aden Government Department of Education inspects schools within the area, gives such advice and assistance as is required and co-ordinates, in so far as possible, educational development throughout the whole territory. A number of new primary schools are in the process of being built in the Western Aden Protectorate.

In the Colony, the Government maintains six boys' and four girls' primary schools and one boys' secondary school. Two post-primary classes have been started in one of the girls' schools. There are in addition five aided primary and two aided secondary schools or sections of schools for boys and two aided primary and two aided secondary schools for girls, as well as several unrecognised schools.

In all schools of the Colony there are approximately 4,678 pupils in primary or indigenous schools (including 1,349 girls), and 1,162 pupils in secondary schools (including 161 girls).

There is no post-secondary education given in the Colony at present but Aden College, the new secondary school, is due to open in January, 1952. Building has already begun, and the College is scheduled to include post-secondary classes. Fourteen men are at present on scholarship in the United Kingdom following teaching, engineering, nursing and medical courses. In addition there
are four young women in the Sudan following the teaching training course. A nominated Scholarship Committee investigates and advises the Government on scholarships to be awarded.

Classes for adult females are conducted at the Government Girls' School. Commercial classes are held at the Government Secondary School and at a privately run commercial institution.

Small committees of parents have been formed for each primary school in substitution of the advisory committee. A teacher training section has now been added to the Government Secondary School. The second year of the teacher training section at the Government Secondary School has attracted thirteen men.

Full new courses of handwork and physical training have been introduced into the Government primary and secondary schools. The Technical Instructor has introduced handwork into the primary and lower secondary schools. The Technical College is due to open in January, 1951.

The British Council opened an Institute for men in 1940 and an Institute for women in 1942.

**Information Services**

The Aden Information Office services cover the Colony and Protectorate in respect of which a grant is received from His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.

These services consist of a system of communiques to the local Aden press, and to the general public; the hire of newsreels and documentary films to commercial cinemas; mobile film units which give free exhibitions of Arabic and English newsreels, documentary and feature films to schools, clubs, hospitals, and barracks, and public shows in open squares (the film service will shortly be extended to the Aden Protectorate); distribution of British, Arab and Indian publications to clubs, merchants' associations, and other interested bodies; exhibitions of posters and photographs and such publicity material of interest to the local population; the provision of copy regarding Aden to Britain and other countries for publication.

Public address speakers operated from the Information Office, are installed at the main centres of the town and used to give announcements of public interest and the installation of a Radio Rediffusion system is under investigation.

Information services are under the District Commissioner as Information Officer, assisted by an Advisory Committee on which the local unofficial opinions of the English, Arab, and Indian communities are represented.

**Health**

There is a Government civil hospital (300 beds) in Crater, and a maternity and child welfare clinic (15 maternity beds and two children's wards of five beds each). There is a hospital of the Keith Falconer Mission at Sheikh Othman (60 beds).

There are three Government dispensaries, one in each division of the town, excluding Crater, two dispensaries administered by charitable organisations for the sick poor, and a small Government dispensary at Perim Island.

Public health work is supervised by a Medical Officer of Health under the control of the Director of Medical Services. The infectious diseases hospital (100 beds) is also under his care.

The Port Health Officer is responsible for the out-patient treatment of members of the merchant navies on vessels in port. He is also in charge of routine quarantine administration and the maintenance of Flint Island quarantine station.

**Labour**

The great majority of unskilled labour in Aden Colony comes from the surrounding territories of the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen. Aden born Arabs are not ordinarily engaged as unskilled labour, but are employed generally as traders, clerks, artisans (particularly carpenters), fishermen, drivers and mechanics. The small harbour craft are mostly manned by Somalis. A Labour and Welfare Officer has been appointed and supervises the administration of labour legislation in respect of workmen's compensation, employment of women and children and investigation of labour disputes.

**Welfare**

Prior to 1948 no provision was made for welfare services, but in 1948 an Assistant Welfare Officer was appointed. His work includes investigation into the background of juvenile offenders who are brought before the Court, assisting towards the organisation of Youth Clubs, and he is generally employed under the Labour and Welfare Officer.

**Communications**

**Roads**

Communication between the various townships is by road. The main roads are constructed in bituminous macadam and the carriage ways average 20 feet in width. Many secondary roads are similarly constructed and a programme for making up Bazaar roads is still going on. The mileage of roads in the Colony at 31st December, 1949, was as under:

| Bituminous macadam roads | Water-bound macadam roads | Unmade roads | Total |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-------|
| 54·34 miles              | 7·60 miles               | 12·33 miles | 74·27 miles |

**Railways**

There are no railways in Aden.

**Shipping**

The Port, which is administered by a Board of Trustees formed in 1889 under the Aden Port Trust Act of 1888, has been considerably improved in recent years.

The harbour now has 15 first-class berths, 4 second-class berths, and 6 third-class berths suitable for vessels ranging from 300 feet to 700 feet in length. Vessels of greater length can be accommodated if necessary. Additional berthing will be provided in the near future and the question of alongside berthing facilities is being actively considered. The approach channel and the major portion of the mooring basin is dredged to 36 feet. There are ten oiling berths, seven on the south side operated by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and three on the north side operated by Caltex (Aden), Ltd. Oil can be delivered to ships at a rate of up to 800 tons an hour.

The Port Trust owns two powerful tugs and the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company have a large tug of their own which is available to the Port Trust for use in berthing and unberthing vessels. The Port Trust tugs are fitted
with fire-fighting apparatus. There are four floating docks, the largest of which can lift 2,000 tons. There are approximately fifteen small privately-owned tugs suitable for lighter work and some 150 lighters for handling cargo and coal. Separate jetties have been constructed for the handling of petroleum and ammunition and there are numerous private and public wharves alongside which lighters can discharge. Shed accommodation is available on some of the wharves and the Port Trust owns sheds at Maalla covering an area of 16,300 sq. yards. The Port Trust has a well-equipped workshop and employs three divers for work in the harbour. Repairs to hull and machinery can be carried out in the workshops of local firms.

The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and during the twelve months ending 31st March, 1950, 4,004 ships called, representing a total tonnage of 16,221,416 tons net.

Alaska Airways and Near East Air Transport have been operating a charter service between Aden and Lydda in connection with the evacuation of Jews from the Yemen to Israel.

Posts and Telephones

Mails

Surface mails between Aden and all parts of the world are exchanged as opportunity offers by the frequent, but for the time being irregular, steamship services using the port.

Air mails to and from all parts of the world are exchanged several times weekly by the Aden Airways service operated between Aden and Cairo, which calls at Kamaran, Asmara, Jeddah and Port Sudan. At Cairo this service connects with the main trunk services of the B.O.A.C. operating between London and South Africa, and between London and India, Pakistan, Malaya, the Far East, and Australia. Aden Airways service is also used to exchange regular direct air mails with Ethiopia, the Somaliland Protectorate, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, the Eastern Aden Protectorate and East and South Africa.

Ethiopian Air Lines operate a weekly service between Addis-Ababa, Jibouti, and Aden, with an extension to Karachi and Bombay.

Banking

The National Bank of India, Ltd., is established in the colony with its chief office in the Crater and a branch at Steamer Point. The commercial firm of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw & Bros. also carries on the business of banking.

There is one Savings Bank operated by the Post Office.

Production and Trade

Salt

The principal native product of Aden is salt made from sea-water by solar evaporation in a series of pans. The export in 1949 amounted to 242,266 tons.

This industry is in the hands of four manufacturers—one Italian, three Indian owned. The tonnage produced during the year 1949 was 303,432 tons.

Fisheries

The existing fishery is primitive, 1,250 men with 34 open boats and 350 dugout canoes selling both to the fresh market and to the salt fish exporters. The last also handle a large part of the Protectorate output of salt fish. There are no power fishing craft and no modern cold storage facilities.

Industry

The main industry is the bunkering of ships and the handling of cargo. These activities are in the hands of large firms—the labour employed is almost entirely immigrant Yemeni Arabs who come south for a year or two.

The entrepot trade is in the hands of large merchants, European, Indian, and Arab, who are concerned in the export of hides, skins, coffee, gums, incense and grain and in the import and distribution of all kinds of merchandise, particularly cotton piece-goods, hardware, sugar, spices, and kerosene.

There are some small factories (owned by private companies). The chief are soap works, aluminium pressing of domestic utensils, manufacture of cigarettes and dyeing and printing of cloth. These supply the local demand and provide for export to adjoining territories.

Of industries organised among small producers, the principal one is the weaving of cloth, by one-man treadle-operated handlooms. This supplies Aden and adjoining territories. Small crushing plants, with one camel turning a mill, extract sesame oil for cooking purposes.

Aden Protectorate

Situation and Area

The Aden Protectorate, which can be more conveniently described administratively and geographically by dividing it into two areas, the Western and Eastern, has a total superficial area of about 112,000 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the western boundary of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen (whose southern boundary was temporarily stabilised by Article III of the Treaty of Sana’a of 11th February, 1934, by which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of the Yemen agreed to maintain the status quo as on the date of the signature of the treaty), and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. The Aden Protectorate seaboard starts at Husn Murad (opposite Perim) on the west and runs for 740 miles eastwards to Ras Dhurbat Ali where it meets the frontier of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.

Climate

The maritime plains are damp and hot in the summer and are subject to sand storms and high winds. In the winter (October to the end of March) it is cool and sometimes cold at night and much less damp.

In the mountains, which vary in height between 1,500 and 8,000 feet, it is drier and cooler during the day and night above 2,500 feet; and above 4,500 feet it can be very cold.
In the Wadi Hadhramaut and the intervening tableland or "Jol" extremes of both heat and cold are encountered. The heat in contrast to that of the coast is dry but more intense. The rainfall is small.

There is little rainfall in the littoral and maritime hills: here cultivation is chiefly dependent on irrigation from water channels and courses. In the highlands well irrigation is common and there is heavier rainfall which is led down ravines and defiles into terraced fields.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Ruba' Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys. Some of the valleys are very fertile. The plateau itself is broken up by numerous hills and mountains and is intersected with several deep valleys.

The greater part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate consists of desert and barren mountains intersected by wadis, some of which are fertile and cultivated. There are a number of comparatively large towns, notably Mukalla, the capital of the Qu'aiti State and principal seaport, and Saiun, the capital of the Kathiri State.

The Western Aden Protectorate consists of the following tribal districts, the chiefs of which are in protective treaty relations with His Majesty's Government:

- Abdali, His Highness Sultan Fadhl Abdul Karim, Sultan of Lahej, who is the premier chief of the western area.
- Amirli, Amir Nasr bin Shaif Seif, C.M.G.
- Capital, Dhala.
- Fadhli, Sultan Abdullah bin Uthman.
- Capital, Shuqra.
- Lower Yafa'i, Sultan 'Aidrus bin Muhsin.
- Capital, Al Qara.
- Haushabi, Sultan Muhammad bin Sarur, O.B.E.
- Capital, Museimir.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate comprises the Hadhramaut (consisting of the Qu'aiti State of Shihri and Mukalla and the Kathiri State of Sai'un), the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra, the Wahidi Sultanates of Balhaf and Bir 'Ali, and the Sheikdoms of Irqa and Haura, all of which have been for many years in protective treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. His Highness Sultan Sir Salih bin Ghalib al Qu'aiti, K.C.M.G., Sultan of Shihri and Mukalla, is the premier chief in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and the Hadhramaut is the most important and best organised of these areas. It is bounded on the west by the Wahidi Sultanates and on the east by the Mahri Sultanate.

The Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra is the most easterly area in the Aden Protectorate, being bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. The Sultan of Qishn and Socotra resides on the island of Socotra, which lies off Africa, 150 miles from Cape Guardafui. The island was occupied by the East India Company in 1834, and it came under British protection, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kuri and Brothers Islands, in 1866, when the treaty with the Mahri Sultan was concluded. Socotra produces aloes, dragons' blood and ghee. The population is probably about 5,000; the island is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous and the Fidahan Hajr rises to nearly 5,000 feet. The capital is Hadibu, known on European maps as Tamrida.

**POPULATION**

The population of the Aden Protectorate is roughly estimated at 800,000.

**RELIGION**

The people are Muslim Arabs of, almost entirely, the Shafa'i persuasion.

**HISTORY**

For a time in the 18th century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana'a (capital of the Yemen of today) and several of the rulers of the tribal districts, such as the 'Abdali, Haushabi, Amiri, Yafa'i and 'Aulaqi sultans, were the Imam's "wakils" or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence. This occurred in 1728 in the case of the 'Abdali and in 1758 in the case of the Yafa'i.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the 'Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July, 1915, during the first world war, the Turks, who then held the Yemen, occupied the 'Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts until the armistice of 1918.

In February, 1934, as has been stated, a Treaty of Friendship was signed between His Majesty's Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower 'Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa'i sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala') entered into closer relations with His Majesty's Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. In 1948, the Saqladi followed suit.
The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri sultans and the rise of the Qu’aiti—a dynasty with its origins among the Yaifa’i tribes and influence arising from military and other services rendered as emigres to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu’aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with His Majesty’s Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with the other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri sultans made an agreement with the Qu’aiti sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu’aiti and Kathiri sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British Resident Adviser in all matters except those concerning Muhammadan religion and custom. Relations with the smaller states are governed by similar Protectorate treaties.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The interests of the Western Aden Protectorate are looked after by a small cadre of British political officers and Arab assistant political officers under a British Agent, whose headquarters are in Aden. The political staff who are posted to administrative districts inland advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas, since His Majesty’s Government does not administer the Protectorate directly.

The tribes nominate their own chiefs who have subsequently to be recognised by the Governor of Aden. Not all the chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery. For internal security some of the chiefs have tribal guards (some partly paid for by His Majesty’s Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the British Agent and the chief. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate; they are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Government.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal states, Qu’aiti and Kathiri, are administered by their sultans as constitutional rulers and have State councils. The Kathiri State is hampered in its development by the absence of an outlet to the sea and of the customs dues and other benefits which would result from it. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the British Agent and Resident Adviser, E.A.P.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Education in the Aden Protectorate is under the immediate general guidance of the British Agents, who have on their staff a Protectorate Education Officer, who inspects schools and gives advice or assistance where required. Although the Education Department does not directly control Education in the Protectorate it co-ordinates development, as far as possible, throughout the whole area.

The Aden Protectorate College for the Sons of Chiefs, a primary boarding school of limited size, which is situated in the colony, is the only exception to this; it is administered directly by the Department of Education.

The policy has been to encourage the Sultanates to develop their own State Education Departments, and there are now two such in existence. An Educational Assistant to the Resident Adviser, seconded from the Sudan, who is also Director of Education in the Qu’aiti State, assists the Mukalla Government in educational matters. There are now over 20 primary schools at various centres and an intermediate boarding school at Gheil Ba Wazir for about 200 pupils. Several scholarships have been awarded to promising students to complete their education in the Sudan.

The other State which has its own department is Lahej, where there is an intermediate school with about 140 boys.

There is no post primary education in the Protectorate, but plans are being made to establish a secondary boarding school in the Colony, which may be available to Protectorate as well as Colony boys.

The number of primary (or lower than primary) schools which are inspected is now about 50.

The Government of Aden, in co-operation with the Church of Scotland Mission, has introduced a medical scheme in the Western Aden Protectorate which covers 12 tribal areas and employs 29 dispensers who work in 17 separate dispensaries.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic. The chief of these in the Western Aden Protectorate are:

1. Aden (north and north-westwards) through Lahej to Ta’iz (Yemen) and to Dhala and Qataba (Yemen).
2. Aden westwards to Subaihi country.
3. Aden eastwards to—
   (a) Lower Yaifa’.
   (b) Ahwar (Lower ’Aulaqi).
   (c) Fadhli country.
   (d) ’Adhali country.
   (e) Dathina.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate considerable progress has been made in recent years in road development and the following routes now exist:

Mukalla to—
(a) Wadi Hadhramaut via Jahi, Haura, Shibam (West Road).
(b) Wadi Hadhramaut via ’Aqabat Ma’ddi and Reidat al Ma’ra (East Road).
(c) ’Irma via Reidat ad Deiyin.
(d) Reidat ’Abdul Wadud via Shihr.
(e) Natural tracks exist to Bir ’Asakir, Shabwa, Bir Al ’Abr and the Northern forts of Manwakh and Zamakh.

In the main Wadi Hadhramaut there are tracks from Haura to Khun, and from there to Qabr Hud a natural track with minor construction work. In Wadi ’Amd there is a track as far as Kherba. This joins on to the West road near Haura.

**PUBLIC REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE**

The following are the 1949–50 estimated figures of revenue and expenditure for some of the Western Aden Protectorate States:

|                | Revenue Rs. | Expenditure Rs. |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Fadhli         | 262,000     | 260,000         |
| Lower Aulaqi   | 43,000      | 41,000          |
| Lower Yaifa’   | 31,000      | 29,000          |
| Dathina        | 75,000      | 62,000          |
| Amiri          | 66,000      | 62,000          |
In some other cases administrations have only recently been set up and it is not possible to estimate their revenues as yet.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the Revenue of the Qu'aiti State is over 27 lakhs of rupees and expenditure 26 lakhs. The principal sources of revenue at present are customs and excise and licence dues. In the Qu'aiti State 13 lakhs are spent on armed constabulary and police, nearly 2 lakhs on medical and public health, nearly 3 lakhs on education. The State has also put aside large sums from reserves for the purchase of motor pumps for irrigation, and for the building and repairing of dams and deflectors.

The Kathiri State of Sai'un has a revenue of about 3 lakhs and expenditure of 2½ lakhs of rupees.

The Wahidi Sultanates of Balhaf and Bir 'Ali have a revenue of less than one lakh and expenditure of about 75,000/- rupees.

**Currency and Banking**

In the Western Aden Protectorate rupees and riyals (or Maria Theresa dollars) are the currency used, the present (1950) rate of exchange being 2 rupees and 11 annas to the riyal.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, up to 1944, the Maria Theresa dollar was the currency used throughout the interior but in that year the rupee currency was officially adopted. Maria Theresa dollars, however, remain the normal form of currency in the Wahidi country and vicinity.

There are no banking facilities in the Aden Protectorate.

**Trade, Industry and Agriculture**

Trade in the Western Aden Protectorate is chiefly confined to transit trade from the Yemen, from which coffee and skins are exported, but no reliable figures are available. The only industries are weaving, dyeing and charcoal-burning. Some 10,000 camels bring vegetables, eggs, fodder and cattle for sale in Aden every month.

Imports into the Western Aden Protectorate include kerosene, soap, ginger, tobacco, rice, flour, tea, sugar and assorted cloths, etc.

Agriculture is the chief occupation of the majority of the tribesmen of the Western Aden Protectorate. Every possible use is made of irrigation and water rights are a frequent cause of tribal feuds.

The staple crops are corn (dhurra), bulrush millet (dukhn) and some Indian corn. Wheat and barley are found at the higher altitude; other crops are sesame and lucerne: some cotton and local indigo (hawir) is also grown. Dates are grown in some areas and coffee in Yafa'. Bananas, papayas, apricots and peaches are found in the 'Abdali and 'Audhali sultanates. Honey is found in small quantities in two or three areas.

The annual catch of wet fish has been estimated at 50,000 tons for a good season. At least 75 per cent. of this is taken in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Of the Eastern Aden Protectorate catch, by far the greater part is taken on the Mahra Coast. The craft employed are small and the fishing gear primitive. Most of the fish is cured for consumption inland and for export to Africa and the Far East.

Bahama Islands

Situation and Area

The Bahamas are an archipelago of islands, cays and rocks lying between 20° 50' and 27° 25' latitude and 72° 37' and 80° 32' longitude, and extending from Inagua on the south to Matanilla Reef on the north; from Mayaguana and its adjacent rocks and cays on the east to, and including, the Cay Sal Bank on the west, and separated from Florida, to the west, by the Straits of Florida, and from Cuba, to the south, by the old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

The total area of the colony is 4,403½ square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

Climate

The winter climate is salubrious and most delightful, frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70° F., the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. During the summer months the greatest heat ranges from 80° F. to 90° F., and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating.

The rainfall for the year 1949 amounted to 53-88 inches. The average annual rainfall for the years 1947-49 was 54·51 inches.

The islands are sometimes visited in the autumn by hurricanes but the new hurricane reporting service at Miami, Florida gives advance warning of these, so that adequate precautions can be taken to minimise damage and prevent loss of life.

General Description

The colony consists of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited, and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are, generally, long, narrow and low lying, and the ground is rocky, but the coral rocks contain pockets of rich fertile soil. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, the Biminis,
Watling's Island (or San Salvador), Grand Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklins Island, Mayaguana, Andros Island and the Berry Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants is of the negro race, about one-sixth is of Caucasian descent. English is universally spoken.

The islands are of aeolian limestone formation and contain no mineral wealth. They are subtropical and both temperate and tropical trees exist, the pine tree and the palm growing literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.

The soil, except in small pockets, is usually shallow and overlays hard limestone rock and is on the whole suitable only for peasant farming.

Nassau, the capital of the colony, is the centre of the tourist industry, which is of paramount importance in the economic life of the colony. It has a pipe-borne water supply and an up-to-date sewerage system, an ice plant, electric light and automatic telephone systems, a broadcasting station and telephone service to all parts of the world.

There are excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists, who visit the colony from the United States, Canada, and all parts of the world, throughout the year. The tourists are attracted by the ideal climate, the clear water and white beaches, the beautiful colouring of the sea and sky, and opportunities afforded for swimming, fishing, boating, etc.

Fish abound in the waters of the colony, and Biminis, which is a centre for sports fishing, is visited by numbers of fishing enthusiasts from the United States.

### POPULATION

### RELIGION

There is no state religion, the Church of England having been disestablished in 1869. The religions with the largest number of followers are the Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists and Roman Catholics.

### HISTORY

San Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had any settlements on any of the islands of this group at any time. Early in the 17th century the islands were well known to the settlers of Bermuda and the Carolinas. They were included in the Royal Grant of Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney-General of England, of the 30th of October, 1629. By 1640 the islands had become a well-known place of resort by the inhabitants of Bermuda, and on the 9th of July, 1647, The Company of Eleutherian Adventurers was formed in London for the purpose of making an organised attempt at a systematic colonisation and development of the islands. William Sayle, a former Governor...
of Bermuda, was the moving spirit of this venture, and associated with him were a number of influential city merchants and members of Parliament. On the 31st of August, 1649, Parliament, on the petition of Sayle and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands," which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding the Royal Grant to Heath in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles the Second, on the 1st of November, 1670, granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, namely, the Duke of Albermarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Berkley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret and Sir Peter Colleton. Before the Royal Grant of 1670 the inhabitants of the islands had organised the settlement and instituted a form of government which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected Captain John Wentworth as their Governor. Wentworth applied to and received commissions from the Governors of Jamaica. The Lords Proprietors appointed Hugh Wentworth as their first Governor on 24th April, 1671, but he did not take up the appointment. They then confirmed in office John Wentworth, the popularly elected Governor, on the 26th of December, 1671. A regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown on the surrender of their rights by the Lords Proprietors on the 28th October, 1717. Thirteen proprietary governors were appointed between 1671 and 1715. The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the settlement was reformed by their return, principally from Jamaica, under the leadership of Thomas Bridges. Bridges was recognised as Governor by the Lords Proprietors on the 12th July, 1688, and the settlement had reached some importance when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards in 1703. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned to New Providence and another proprietary governor was appointed in 1707. But the islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place, and thus accede to the numerous petitions which the inhabitants had been making for several years and also carry out the express wishes of Parliament. Since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but they had been retaken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux before the conclusion of the war, which was brought to an end by the Peace of Versailles, 1783, when the British possession was confirmed. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas Group and received substantial assistance from England, and on the 19th of March, 1787, the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

The Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, and which had often in their early history been claimed both by Bermuda and the Bahamas, were separated from the other Bahamas in 1848, and formed into a distinct presidency, under the government-in-chief of Jamaica.

CONSTITUTION

The present constitution of the Bahamas is similar to those of the North American colonies prior to the War of Independence. The government is modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected Houses of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

"The Eleutherian Adventurers," who came to the Bahamas from Bermuda after the Parliamentary grant of 1647, brought with them a conception of representative government already established in Bermuda, and the affairs of the infant settlement were managed by a Governor, a Council and an elected Senate. The Charter of 1670 to the Lords Proprietors provided for an elected House of Assembly, and the Constitution, much as it exists to-day, was finally settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. The Bahamas enjoy representative, though not responsible, government. The executive government is in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who has the power of veto, and is advised by an Executive Council. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation are vested by law in the Governor in Council.

The Legislative Council, consisting of nine members nominated by the Crown, was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841.

The House of Assembly is composed of 29 members elected for 15 districts. The qualification for members is possession of real or personal property to the value of £200. The Out Islands seldom return a member of their own community, their 21 representatives being generally inhabitants of New Providence. The qualification for electors is ownership of land to the value of £5 or the occupation of houses of annual rental value of £2 8s., in New Providence, or half that amount in the Out Islands. Women have not the vote. The normal life of the House is seven years, but it may be dissolved at any time by the Governor, as occurred in June, 1928, and in May, 1935. A general election was held in 1949. No forms of local government exist.

ADMINISTRATION

The executive government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor aided by an Executive Council not exceeding nine members. In the absence of the Governor the senior member of the Executive Council administers the government.

In addition to the usual government departments in New Providence there are public boards dealing with public works, education, health, piloting, agricultural and marine products, electrical development, telephones, prisons, industrial school, licensing (liquor and shops) and libraries, which are appointed annually by the Governor, consisting of five members, two of whom are required to be members of the House of Assembly. These boards determine the policy and control the expenditure of the departments concerned, but the work is carried out under the supervision and direction of the head of the department.

In the Out Islands the commissioners administer their respective districts; and annual boards of works and health under their chairmanship are appointed by the Governor.
SOCIAL SERVICES*

Education

There is a government system of elementary education, established in 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1885, and Consolidating Act of 1908. Attendance is compulsory from 6 to 14 years of age. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

| No. of Schools | Approximate No. of Pupils |

| Non-sectarian government | 89 | 13,356 |
| Aided | 35 | |
| Denominational | 46 | 3,591 |
| Private | 7 | 334 |
| Totals | 177 | 17,281 |

The government elementary schools were made free in 1885. Higher education is provided at Queen's College, St. Francis Xavier's Academy, the Government High School, and St. Augustine's Boys School, all in Nassau.

On 5th October, 1949, Lord Listowel, Minister of State for the Colonies, opened the Technical School for Boys at Oakes Field.

On 9th January, 1950, the Board of Education Training College was opened at Oakes Field.

Broadcast Lessons

Lessons for children in the preparatory schools are broadcast daily from 9.15 a.m. to 9.45 a.m., and for children in the senior and junior schools daily from 9.45 a.m. to 10.15 a.m. Teacher training lectures and adult education programmes are also broadcast in the evenings from 6.15 p.m. to 6.45 p.m.

Information

Broadcasting

At a Broadcasting Conference in Washington in February the classification of the broadcasting station and the frequency of operation were altered. The frequency of 640 kcs., which had been previously shared with a station at Los Angeles, had to be relinquished in favour of the frequency of 1,540 kcs., in view of the claims to the use of 640 kcs. by a Cuban broadcasting station. At the same time the Nassau broadcasting station, which had previously been recognised as adherent to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, was granted the classification of a Class 1-A clear channel dominant station on the new frequency of 1,540 kcs., and in accordance with the engineering limits laid down under the Agreement must receive protection from interference according to the North American Regional Broadcasting standards. The change to the new frequency was carried out in June, and operation has proved to be satisfactory. The Bahamas is now signatory to the North American Regional Agreement, and, as such, is entitled to consideration in any future discussions regarding the use of radio frequencies in the standard broadcast band. This is a considerable improvement over the previous conditions under which the station operated and gives the Colony the recognition which it should have in view of its proximity to the United States and other countries signatory to the North American Regional Agreement.

A further North American Regional Broadcasting Conference is to be held in Canada in 1949, at which the allocation of frequencies in the North American region will again be reviewed.

There is a Bahamas Government Information Bureau in London.

Health

The medical and public health service is administered by a Health Board.

The medical needs of the colony in New Providence are met by the Bahamas General Hospital and Prospect Hospital (ex R.A.F.) temporarily till New General and Mental Hospitals are built. There is a full-time resident staff of four doctors, Matron and eight sisters, with sixty-five local nurses (55 in training).

The service of the hospital is furnished largely free of charge. There is an outpatient department, a general hospital, a lunatic asylum, infirmary, dental clinic, venereal and gynaecological clinic. There are X-ray and bacteriological laboratories.

There are four Out Islands District Medical Officers, and ten Private Medical Practitioners in New Providence.

Labour

There is a Labour Officer appointed by the Governor whose chief functions have, up to the present, been the registering of unemployed and the recruitment of agricultural labourers for work in the United States.

There is a standing Labour Board appointed by the Governor for the purpose of advising on any question arising regarding wages.

Legislation affecting trade unions and workmen's compensation was passed in 1943. So far the only trade union is the Bahamas Trades and Labour Union.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

During the war many roads in New Providence were reconditioned by the R.A.F. and most important roads in the island have now been treated with asphalt.

Shipping

With the exception of an irregular service between Nassau and Miami by small local motor vessels, and an occasional freighter from England and Canada, all steamship service to the colony was discontinued as a result of the war.

Freight and passenger services between Bahamas and England, Canada and the United States are being re-established.

Air

Oakes' Airport is the main airfield in the Bahamas which provides 24-hour service for long range international and local airlines. In 1949 frequent services were in operation between...
Nassau and England via Bermuda, Canada, United States, Havana and South America via Jamaica.

British-South American Airways Corporation, now known as the British Overseas Airways Corporation, has its Caribbean base at Nassau and besides operating services to England via Bermuda, Jamaica and Havana provides a daily service between Nassau and Miami which is increased to three daily in the season.

Pan American World Airways also operates the Nassau-Miami service, stepping its service up to five a day during the tourist season.

Trans Canada Airlines operate frequent services between Montreal, Toronto, Nassau and Jamaica, these services linking Nassau with the Trans Canada Airlines' North Atlantic services to the United Kingdom.

Of the local companies operating from Oakes' Airport, Bahamas Airways provides scheduled services to the Out Islands and also to the United States. Charter flying is carried out by both Bahamas Airways, Nassau Aviation and Skyways Limited.

There is a private landing strip at Rock Sound, Eleuthera, and a two-runway airport is under construction at the Butlin Vacation Village, West End, Grand Bahama. One runway has been completed and was opened to aircraft up to the DC-4 category in February, 1950.

At the end of March, 1950, there were twelve aircraft on the Bahamas register of aircraft. Terminal traffic at Oakes' Airport and transit traffic through the Nassau Control Area in 1949 showed a marked increase over 1948 and the first few months of 1950 have shown an increase over the corresponding months of 1949.

Postal

Internal Services

Mails are despatched weekly from Nassau by fast motor vessels to the majority of outer islands.

In addition, mails are despatched by air daily (except Sundays) to West End, Grand Bahama; twice a week to nearby settlements of Eleuthera District (three times a week during the winter); to other islands as opportunity offers.

International Service

Surface mails are despatched from Nassau to Miami once a week. Mails are also forwarded direct to New York, Great Britain and Jamaica, as opportunity offers.

Air mails are despatched from Nassau to Miami daily (except Sundays); twice daily, Mondays to Thursdays. In addition, air mails are despatched direct to Great Britain and Bermuda five times per week and to Jamaica three times per week.

Radio Telephone and Telegraph

The Telecommunications Department provide radio telegraph service to all parts of the world via Tropical Radio, Miami, and Cable and Wireless, Jamaica. The radio telegraph service with Miami is provided by a frequency shift radio teleprinter circuit. This system provides high speed automatic transmission and reception by direct teleprinter machines with automatic retransmission at Miami into the Western Union System of the United States.

Marine radio telephone service, providing communication over a range of 300 miles enabling vessels suitably equipped to communicate direct into the automatic telephone system of Nassau, is also provided. Other similar installations have been provided on the islands of Cat Cay and Inagua, thus giving coverage to the whole of the area of the Bahama Islands for private vessels, coastal service vessels and ocean liners.

During 1949, additional circuits were provided between Nassau and the Out Islands. A second radio telephone, and a second radio telegraph circuit were introduced.

During the latter part of 1949, a third radio telephone circuit to Miami was established. With the three circuits in operation during the winter season, all demands were comfortably met.

The Telecommunications also provide all aeronautical telecommunications facilities for the operation of Oakes' Airport.

PUBLIC FINANCE

In December, 1948, the authorised Public Debt was £245,000, made up of locally raised loans. The total held for repayment was £175,206. The chief liquid assets consist of surplus funds investments in England in trustee securities.

There is neither income tax nor excise duty. The main sources of revenue are customs dues and receipts from fees, post office and public utilities. The general customs duty is 20 per cent. ad valorem plus 5 per cent. ad valorem emergency tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no emergency tax, spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general, and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American trade agreements.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States currency is also generally accepted in the colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government through the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. A total amount of £605,000 of these notes was in circulation on 31st December, 1948. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is a branch bank of the Royal Bank of Canada in Nassau (New Providence).

A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1949, deposited £351,526.
