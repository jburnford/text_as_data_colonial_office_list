JAMAICA

SITUATION AND AREA

Jamaica is an island situated in the Caribbean Sea between latitude 17° 43' N. and 18° 32' N., and longitude 76° 11' W. and 78° 20' 50" W., about 4,120 miles to the south-west of England, 100 miles west of Haiti, 90 miles south of Cuba, 445 miles north of Cartagena, and 540 miles from Colon. The greatest length of Jamaica is 148 miles and its greatest width is 52 miles, while its least width (from Kingston to Annotto Bay) is 224 miles; its area is 4,411 square miles or 2,823,174 acres.

The Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands are dependencies of Jamaica. The Turks and Caicos Islands, with a population of 6,455, lie between 21° and 22° N. and between 71° and 72° 50' W., about 450 miles to the north-east of Jamaica; they comprise several small islands and cays, the largest of which is about ten square miles in area, and six of which are inhabited. The Cayman Islands, with a population of 6,670, which comprise three islands, namely, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are situated between 19° and 20° N., and 79° 83' and 81° 30' W., about 120 miles north-west of Jamaica; the largest, Grand Cayman, is about 90 square miles in area.

CLIMATE

There is a great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78° 7° rising to 87° 6° in the daytime, and falling to 71° 0° in the early morning. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° lower in temperature can be attained by a ride of one hour by motor car.

The rainy seasons occur, usually, over the whole island, in May and June, and again in September, October and November. Besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by occasional showers in other months. In the north-eastern portion of the island, however, there is generally a rainy season at the end of the year and light precipitation, as a rule, during the month of March.
The mean annual rainfall varies from 24 inches at the Quarantine station in the southern division, to 208 inches at Moore Town, followed by 173 inches at Fellowship, both situated on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain range in the north-eastern division. The average annual rainfall is about 77 inches.

Regions of the island are visited by storms of hurricane force about 14 times in a century and disastrous earthquakes occurred in 1692 and 1907.

**General Description**

The surface of the island is mountainous; of the total area of 4,411 square miles only about 891 square miles (or 570,635 acres) are flat, consisting of alluvium, marl and swamps. The highest peak of the Blue Mountain range, in the centre of the island, is 7,402 feet above sea level. There are 26 other principal peaks or spurs ranging in height from 1,500 feet to 6,000 feet.

The island also possesses many rivers and springs, the majority of which rise in the central mountain area ranging from east to west, and flow northward or southward to the coast. The chief of these are the Black River (44 miles long), the Rio Minho, the Rio Cobre, the White River, the Plantain Garden River and the Rio Grande. Most of these rivers, however, have a rapid fall, and only a few are navigable. There are also several mineral springs, the best known of which are the radio-active waters of Milk River Spring in Clarendon and the Sulphur springs at Bath in the parish of St. Thomas.

The largest and most important of the many harbours is at Kingston, the capital, one of the finest natural harbours in the world. This harbour has a total area of some 16 square miles, of which some seven square miles have a depth of from seven to ten fathoms.

Of Jamaica's 2,823,174 acres, it was estimated in 1943 that 1,286,420 were under cultivation; approximately 312,000 acres of cultivable land were not used; 417,000 acres were useless for agriculture (swamps, inaccessible lands, towns, etc.), and 195,000 acres of farmland were used for houses, roads, water catchments and the like.

Under one per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, somewhat over three-fourths being pure negroes. There are about 21,393 East Indians and about 6,900 Chinese (in 1943). English is universally spoken.

**Religion**

The largest religious body in the Colony is the Church of England which, according to the 1943 census, had 350,311 adherents. The government of the Church is vested in a Synod consisting of a Bishop and a suffragan Bishop, the Clergy and representatives of the laity. The Presbyterian Church has 92,975 adherents (1943 census).

Other religious bodies operating in the Colony include the Roman Catholic Church (with about 70,000 members), and the Methodist, Baptist and Congregational Churches, the Salvation Army, and the Seventh Day Adventists Church.

**History**

The island was discovered by Columbus on 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego (the son of Columbus), the Governor of Hispaniola. It was raided by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596-97, and by Colonel Jackson in 1643, but it remained in the possession of the Spaniards until 1655 when it was attacked by a force under Admiral Penn and General Venables sent by Cromwell against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on 11th May, 1655. Until the restoration Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II, who appointed General Edward Doyley Governor-in-Chief, with an elected council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. Part of this town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston, which then consisted of a few sheds, soon rose into a place of importance. During the eighteenth century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves. These consisted primarily of the slaves the Spaniards left, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains, but before long runaway slaves from English masters took refuge in the mountains of the centre of the island and were only subjugated in 1738, when both classes of maroons were settled in five reserves under their own leaders. Thenceforth they gave little trouble except for a small rising in 1795, which was soon suppressed, the prisoners taken being sent to Sierra Leone. When the slave trade was abolished in 1807 there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833 Jamaica received £6,161,927 of the £20,000,000 granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. Unrest among the coloured population in 1865 was
suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1907, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of £150,000 was voted by Parliament, and a loan of £800,000, chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer. There were also severe hurricanes in 1912, 1916, 1917, 1935, 1939 and 1943. A disastrous hurricane in 1944 completely devastated the northern and north-eastern sections of the island, causing little loss of life but great destruction of property (houses and cultivation). The coconut industry in particular received a severe setback. Again the Imperial Government came to the assistance of the island by placing a sum of £2,004,000 at the disposal of the Jamaica Government for the rehabilitation of agriculturists.

A rapid increase in population and the disastrous onslaught of diseases upon banana cultivations were amongst the various causes which brought about a period of economic depression, causing unrest, which culminated in riots in 1938. A local commission of investigation was soon followed by the appointment of the West India Royal Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Moyne.

The establishment of Jamaica Welfare in 1937, has been the principal event in the recent history of social welfare, but many other important developments in the sphere of the social and cultural life took place in the year or two preceding the war.

A new tendency became apparent to combine for common ends, and this led, in the political field, to the formation of parties, in the economic field to the development of co-operatives, and in the industrial field to the formation of trade unions.

**CONSTITUTION**

The original constitution (granted by Charles II in 1662 and surrendered in 1866) was a representative one, consisting of a governor, a nominated council, and an elected assembly which, on its first meeting in 1664, consisted of 30 members, but which fluctuated in numbers from time to time. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne’s Government, in 1839, introduced a bill into parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but it was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the council, harmony was temporarily restored. A separate privy council was set up and an executive council was established. The latter was to act as a sort of cabinet, especially as regards financial matters.

After the suppression of the unrest in 1865 Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of government to meet the circumstances of the community and the necessity of making some sweeping change by which a strong government might be created. The legislature responded by abrogating all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty’s Government to substitute any other form of government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

Accordingly a legislative council was, by Orders in Council of 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were increased to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council, dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex-officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty might from time to time appoint, or as the Governor might from time to time provisionally appoint, and 14 persons to be elected as therein provided.

The Council was dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it had not been previously dissolved.

There was also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary and Attorney-General and such other persons as might be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty, but the number of members was not to exceed eight. The Governor presided at each meeting, and the Governor and two members formed a quorum.

A special feature of this constitution was that nine elected members could veto any financial measure, while the unanimous vote of the whole 14 elected members on other matters could not be overridden by the other votes unless the Governor declared that such a decision was of paramount importance in the public interest.

A new constitution was granted to Jamaica by His Majesty and was brought into effect by proclamation on 20th November, 1944.

Under the terms of this constitution there is established a Privy Council, an Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

**Privy Council**

The Privy Council comprises the Colonial Secretary, Officer Commanding the Troops, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The functions of this body are to advise the Governor in relation to the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service, the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy and the grant of respites or remissions of sentence.

**Executive Council**

The Executive Council, which is the principal instrument of policy, comprises the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary two unofficial members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor, and five members of the House of Representatives elected by that body. The Governor presides over the Executive Council and has a casting, but not an original, vote, and although in general bound to accept the advice of the Executive Council, may, in certain circumstances, decline to accept that advice and report his reasons for so doing to the Secretary of State. The Executive
Council is responsible for the preparation of estimates and for the initiation of all financial measures and all measures designed to implement government policy.

**Legislative Council**

This Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, two official members "who shall be persons holding office of emolument under the Crown in Jamaica" and not less than ten unofficial members "who shall be persons not holding any office of emolument under the Crown in Jamaica".

The Council elects a President who is paid a salary at the rate of £600 per annum. Other nominated members of the Council are reimbursed travelling expenses, but receive no remuneration.

**House of Representatives**

The 14 parishes of the colony have been divided into 32 single member constituencies elected upon adult suffrage franchise for a term of five years.

The House elects from amongst its members a Speaker of the House and five members to serve as elected members of the Executive Council.

The Speaker receives a salary of £1,000 and members are paid at the rate of £650 per annum in addition to travelling and subsistence allowance. At the first election to the House of Representatives held on 14th December, 1944, the Jamaica Labour Party was successful in 22 of the 32 constituencies, the People's National Party in five and the other constituencies returned independent candidates.

At the second election held on the 20th December, 1949, the Jamaica Labour Party obtained 17, the People's National Party 13, and Independents 2 seats.

**Administration**

The colonial revenue is derived mainly from customs duties, excise duties (on rum, beer, tobacco, matches, butter substitutes, soap, aerated water, etc.), internal revenue (income and surtax, postal revenue stamps and death duties, property tax, entertainment tax, licences, judicial revenue, etc.).

The official work of the colony is carried out through some 38 government departments under the control of the Governor as exercised through the Secretariat, which is the centre of administration and serves both as a clearing house for advice and information and as a means of relaying and executing government decisions made by the Governor, the Governor in Privy Council and the Governor in Executive Council. The administration of the two dependencies (the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands) is carried on by a commissioner in each dependency, under the control of the Governor. The Commissioners are each assisted by some six heads of departments and other staff.

Justice is administered in the Colony by three principal courts, viz.: the supreme court, the resident magistrates' courts and the courts of petty sessions. Judges of the supreme court are the chief justice and three puisne judges, who sit individually in chambers, on circuit, or in a body of three as a court of appeal. There are 18 resident magistrates, four for Kingston, two for St. Andrew and one in each of the remaining parishes (Port Royal excepted). Petty sessions are presided over by justices of the peace or by the resident magistrates of the parish.

**Local Government**

With the recent abolition of the parish of Port Royal the Island is now divided into 14 parishes, two of which, namely Kingston and St. Andrew, are amalgamated for local government purposes under a corporate body known as the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation with a mayor and council. Local affairs in the other parishes are administered by parochial boards, one in each parish.

The council of the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation consists of the mayor and 20 others, of which eight, namely, the custodes and members of the house of representatives for the two parishes, are *ex officio*. A parochial board consists of from 15 to 21 members, of which the custos and the members of the house of representatives are *ex officio*, and the remainder are elected. These bodies are elected every three years, but owing to the war the first parochial general elections since 1937 were held only on the 23rd October, 1947. The franchise is now on the basis of adult suffrage. The Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation and parochial boards have considered the recommendations for the reform of local government made by Mr. L. C. Hill, C.B.E., General Secretary of the National Association of Local Government Officers in 1943, and have submitted their recommendations to Government. The Legislature of the Colony will consider certain aspects of Mr. Hill's Report in the near future. The Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation and the parochial boards are responsible for the administration of all local government matters, the most important of which are the maintenance of water supplies (except in the corporate area where this is under the control of a separate body, the Water Commission), municipal and parochial roads, public health and sanitation, markets and the administration (under the guidance of the Board of Supervision) of poor relief. Control of these bodies, financial and otherwise, is, however, exercised by Central Government through the Secretariat, their annual budgets, the expenditure of their funds and decisions on all large issues being subject to the approval of the Governor, the Executive Council and/or the House of Representatives as prescribed by the various laws. The revenue of these bodies, which is derived from local rates and taxes, is supplemented by assistance grants from Government.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Elementary education is provided from public funds. The number of recognised elementary schools is 678, of which 253 are Government Schools and the remainder denominational. There are 134,993 scholars in average attendance and the grant-in-aid for 1949-50 was £964,395; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges...
for women teachers. By a law passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. Local School Boards manage the Government schools, some of which are held in Government buildings, others in rented buildings.

The Government maintains a technical continuation and commercial school in Kingston and awards scholarships for trade instruction and apprenticeship. One continuation school for girls is aided from public funds. Three practical training centres for boys and one for girls are maintained by Government.

Provision was made in 1892 for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are 25 secondary schools receiving aid from public funds under regulations for grants-in-aid. Secondary education is provided for in general by endowed schools, under local governing bodies controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. There are four scholarships (one for girls, one for boys and one for girls and boys in alternate years) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire and one scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica. Awards were discontinued during the war. Additional post-war scholarships are being awarded as far as conditions at Oxford permit. The following examinations are held: London University, Cambridge Locals, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society, City and Guilds of London Institute and the Royal Society of Arts.

The Institute of Jamaica

The Institute of Jamaica, Kingston, "For the encouragement of literature, science and art", maintains five libraries—one general lending, a West India reference and a scientific reference library, a junior centre in East Street and another at Halfway Tree. Other departments are a scientific museum, a small zoo in the gardens, an historic gallery, the historical archives at present housed in Spanish Town, a lecture hall and an art gallery in which exhibitions illustrative of the Island's arts and crafts are held throughout the year.

The total membership is 8,936, the book stock of the general library and the two junior centres being 38,111. The science library has a book stock of approximately 7,000 books and 5,500 pamphlets. The issues of books from the general library for the year April, 1949, to March, 1950, were 129,684 and from the junior libraries 69,964.

The West India reference library contains 15,479 books, periodicals and pamphlets, as well as 2,581 manuscripts, maps and plans relating to Jamaica, the West Indies, Central America and West Africa. This library is a most important centre of research on Caribbean history. Numerous enquiries for information received from abroad and also locally are dealt with, and the library is used by foreign and local research students.

Public Health

Medical and public health services in Jamaica are organised on an island-wide basis by the Government. The Public Health Services were inaugurated as far back as 1918 on a co-operative basis by The International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Government of this country. Public Health Departments were organised by Statute in 1929 (operative April, 1930) and at the present time each of the 14 parishes into which the Island is divided has its own public health department with a full-time Medical Officer (Health), Sanitary Inspectors, Public Health Nurses and District Nurses. In addition, the Public Health Service is organised on a divisional basis whereby specialist officers and staffs are responsible for different spheres of public health activities. These divisions include tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws, health education and malaria.

There are also four Mobile Health Units which carry on a generalised public health programme in different areas.

Case-finding and control measures over a period of years have served to level off the mounds of public health problems that may have existed in Jamaica in the early years of these services. The incidence of communicable diseases has not reached epidemic proportions for several years and while certain diseases, such as yaws and malaria, remain endemic in a few areas, there is ample evidence that disease rates in Jamaica compare favourably with those of more advanced countries, for example, United States and Canada.

The prevention of disease through education and known prophylactic measures remains the basis of public health activities. Preservation of human life, ante-natally and post-natally, and general improvement of the health status of the Island's population are the main objectives.

Alongside the Government's public health activities will be found facilities for the medical care of the sick. Institutional care of the sick is provided in well-equipped general and other hospitals and in dispensaries in the 45 Medical
Districts into which the Island is divided. The following is a list of Government hospitals provided:

- 21 General Hospitals.
- 1 Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital.
- 1 George V Memorial Sanatorium for Chest Diseases.
- 1 Tuberculosis Hospital.
- 1 Mental Hospital.
- 1 Hansen Home for the treatment of Leprosy.

In addition to the directors of various branches of the Medical and Public Health Services, the Central Government employs approximately 150 doctors, 804 nurses, 73 public health nurses (health visitors), 77 sanitary inspectors, 110 technicians and 69 dispensers.

A school for the training of public health nurses and sanitary inspectors is in operation on a co-operative basis by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Government.

Labour

In September, 1938, an unemployment registration bureau was set up for the primary purpose of ascertaining the extent of unemployment in the Kingston area. This bureau formed the nucleus of the Labour Department which was established in June, 1939, to deal with the many labour problems arising in the Island.

The department aims at the promotion and maintenance of good industrial relations between employers and workers by advising associations of employers and trade unions in the light of modern industrial relations practices.

A Factory Act based upon the United Kingdom Act of 1937 has been placed upon the statute book, and over 650 factories employing over 20,000 workers are covered by this legislation. Minimum wage legislation has been promoted through a series of minimum wage boards representative of both sides of industry and of independent members. Minimum wage rates covering over 61,000 workers have been proclaimed in the sugar industry, printing industry, the bread and the biscuit industries, the dry goods trade and the catering trade and the alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage industry. A "holidays with pay" law has been enacted, and recommendations in regard to its application to industries are being made by minimum wage boards. An ad hoc committee has also been recently appointed to make recommendations as to which occupations other than those already dealt with by the minimum wage advisory boards, should be brought within the scope of the holidays with pay law.

The inspection services ensure compliance with the factory laws, the minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employment.

In 1945, a Re-Absorption Department was set up by Government to deal with the resettlement of returning ex-servicemen. This department was, however, abolished on 31st March, 1949, and its duties were distributed between the Lands Department, the Central Housing Authority and the Labour Department. Consequently, the Labour Department has, since 1st April, 1949, undertaken those phases of the work which deal with the placing in employment and the granting of re-settlement loans to ex-servicemen.

Since 1943 the department has been responsible for the recruitment and dispatch of the following forces:

- R.A.F. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 4,912
- Munition workers for United Kingdom 251
- Agricultural workers for United States 54,264
- Industrial workers for United States ... 6,830
- Panama Canal contract workers ... 5,000

Detailed statistical information may be obtained from the department's annual reports which are published.

Welfare

Welfare work is co-ordinated and fostered by the Secretary for Social Welfare Services, who is an officer of the Secretariat. It is his duty to advise Government on all social service matters and on all welfare work in the Colony.

The Jamaica Social Welfare Commission has been created in succession to Jamaica Welfare (1943), Ltd., and this body works in collaboration with the welfare staff of the Lands Department. The process of re-organisation is now going on. The Secretary for Social Welfare Services is the Chairman of the Commission.

Sugar Welfare.—The Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Board is in control of the funds which have accrued as a result of the payment of 5s. for every ton of exported sugar. The Board is appointing welfare officers for the sugar areas and is working in close co-operation with the Welfare Commission. The Board is concentrating upon the establishment of medical clinics and recreational centres in the sugar areas. The Secretary for Social Welfare Services is the Chairman of the Sugar Industry Labour Welfare Board.

Youth work is undertaken by numerous organisations such as Boy Scouts, Boys' Brigade, Girl Guides, Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A. and in Kingston and St. Andrew over 80 clubs are affiliated to the Kingston and St. Andrew Youth Council which has been operating by means of a grant under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act. 4-H Clubs are concerned with youth in the rural areas and are operated throughout the Island under the auspices of the Jamaica Agricultural Society.

Voluntary services represent a considerable amount of welfare work in Jamaica and over 50 organisations are affiliated to a central body known as the Central Council of Voluntary Social Services. The Jamaica Federation of Women organises groups of women in all manner of welfare activities and is extended throughout the Island.

Juvenile Delinquency and Probation Services.—The probation work is undertaken by the Chief Probation Officer with five assistants together with certain officers of the Salvation Army. A new Juveniles Law was passed in December, 1948, and provides for the creation of an Authority for the care or protection of children, which is responsible for all neglected children throughout Jamaica, and for the establishment of Juvenile Courts. The Law will come into operation by proclamation.

Relief of destitute and disabled.—Poor relief is administered by the local authorities, i.e. the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation and the 13 Parochial Boards, under the control and guidance of the Board of Supervision, a statutory
body appointed under the Poor Relief Law, Cap. 53. The local authorities operate through poor relief committees, one in each parish.

Full particulars on labour, education and health matters will be found in the annual report of the Colony and the annual departmental reports of the respective departments.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring, the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum grades are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,565 miles of main roads, and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which approximately 2,137 miles are suitable for motor traffic.

Railways

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay in the parish of St. James, a distance of 112 miles, 60 chains and to Port Antonio in the parish of Portland, in the other direction by a branch line from Spanish Town of 63½ miles; and to Linstead, by a branch line from Bog Walk on the Port Antonio branch, of 3 miles, and by a branch line from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; also, from Logans Junction to Fort Simonds, 5 miles 20 chains. The total length of line open is 207 miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio, on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line in August, 1900. The branch line between Ewarton and Sterling Castle has been closed since 1st September, 1947. That portion between Sterling Castle and Linstead was closed as from the 30th July, 1948, and the track removed. The total railway debt charge for 1949–50, providing for interest only, was £50,276. Receipts in 1949–50 were less than expenditure by £272,753, leaving a deficiency including interest charges of £323,029. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 112½ miles; Spanish Town to Port Antonio, 63½ miles; May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles. A line of telephone alone runs along the railway from Bog Walk to Linstead. The line from Logan’s Junction to Fort Simonds was removed in December, 1949, the All-Island telephone serving in its place.

Public Finance

In the course of the past six years the annual revenue and expenditure have more than doubled, having increased from approximately £8,400,000 in 1942-43 to approximately £20,000,000 in 1948-49.

At the end of the financial year 1948-49 the public debt stood at £11,192,188 representing approximately £8 6s. per head of population, and the estimated value of the sinking funds accumulated towards the redemption of this debt was £2,358,222. The net debt was therefore approximately £8,834,000 which is less than one year's revenue.

The main sources of revenue are customs and excise duties and internal revenue. The total revenue from customs duties in 1948-49 was £3,640,841 of which £3,532,149 was the yield from import duties. Of the £1,664,597 paid in excise duty in 1948-49, £667,653 was in respect of the duty on rum and £729,288 on tobacco. Internal revenue in 1948-49 included £1,836,517 from income tax and surtax, £246,922 from excess profits tax, £301,317 from postal charges, and £120,166 from licences.

The general ad valorem duty is 20 per cent. and the preferential rate to the British Commonwealth is 15 per cent. with variations in the duties on various classes of goods, in addition to specific duties on certain articles falling chiefly under the heading of apparel, drink, food and tobacco.

The following are the figures for expenditure in 1948-49, under the main headings:

| Category       | Expenditure (£) |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Administration | 52,298          |
| Agriculture    | 287,376         |

Currency and Banking

Metallic Currency

British silver of all denominations circulates freely in Jamaica.

Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage issued under Law 49 of 1869 and Law 3 of 1943, respectively, of penny, halfpenny and farthing denominations are in circulation.

Notes

Four commercial banks operate in Jamaica, Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.), Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Bank of Commerce. Their aggregate note circulation on 31st March, 1950, was £51,798.

Jamaica Government currency notes issued under Cap. 275 in circulation on 31st December, 1949, amounted to £3,132,457.

Banks

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871. There are 182 branches now operating. The total deposits on 31st March, 1950, was £2,623,237.

People's Co-operative Banks

People's Co-operative Banks are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Law, Chapter 263. At 31st March, 1950, 120 banks were registered as Agricultural Loan Societies under Section 41 of the Agricultural Loan Societies Law, 1944.

The management of each bank is in the hands of a committee appointed by the shareholders in general meeting at which each member has but one vote, regardless of his shareholding. The banks are supervised by the Agricultural Loan Societies Board.

The Agricultural Loan Societies Law, 1944, provides for the acceptance of withdrawable deposits by banks operating as Agricultural Loan Societies under a scheme to be approved by the Governor in Executive Council and by the Legislature. The chief business of the banks, however, is the provision of credit for co-operative, agricultural and industrial objects.

The total membership of the banks under the supervision of the Agricultural Loan Societies Board at 31st December, 1949, was 72,712, the issued share capital was £215,727 10s., and the paid up share capital £132,974 18s. 1d.

The Agricultural Loan Societies Board makes advances from the Agricultural Credit Revolving Fund created by Law 28 of 1944. The amount at credit of this fund at the 31st March, 1950, was £455,000. The following statement sets out the position at 31st March, 1950, of the various types of loans issued by the Board to banks from the Revolving Fund:

The banks are the medium used by Government to assist agriculturists who have suffered loss by hurricane or other natural calamity, and rehabilitation loans were issued after the hurricanes in 1912, 1916, 1917, 1935, 1939, and 1943. After the disastrous hurricane in August, 1944, the Imperial Government came to the assistance of the Island and placed a sum of £2,004,000 at the disposal of the Jamaica Government for the rehabilitation of agriculturists. This sum was made available to agriculturists through the Agricultural Loan Societies Board and the Co-operative Banks.

At 31st March, 1950, only applications for building rehabilitation loans in respect of buildings already under construction were still being received and considered. The following statement shows the advances issued to banks for re-loan to sufferers in the 1944 hurricane:

Production and Trade

The value of the total trade of Jamaica showed a slight upward trend in 1949. This rise was due mainly to an increase in the value of exports which offset the decrease in the value of imports. Food, drink and tobacco accounted for £4,807,125 in 1949 as against £4,930,575 in 1948.

The total value of commodity trade (imports and exports) for the year 1949 amounted to £31,363,000, of which imports accounted for £19,226,000, domestic exports £11,843,000 and foreign exports £294,000.

The value of imports showed an increase by 196 per cent. over that for the pre-war year 1938, although a decline by 7 per cent. was reflected when compared with the percentage value increase for 1948. The value of exports increased by 141 per cent. over the value of the base year 1938 and 15 per cent. over that for 1948.

The economy of Jamaica is predominantly agricultural, and approximately one-half of the total available labour force is engaged in agriculture and allied occupations. The remainder of the working population is engaged mainly in the building trades, cottage industries, fishing, processing, manufacture of goods for local consumption and export. The main crops exported were sugar, bananas, rum, cigars, pimento, ginger, coffee raw, cocoa raw and citrus pulp.

Acresages of some of the principal crops are:

| Crop          | Acres |
|---------------|-------|
| Canes         | 90,000|
| Coffee        | 17,400|
| Coconuts      | 10,000|
| Bananas       | 55,000|

| Maize and rice| 23,500|
| Pulses        | 13,000|
| Tobacco       | 2,800 |

The tourist industry reached an all time high during 1949. The total number of visitors to the island was 68,628 with a total estimated revenue intake of £2,607,080.

CAYMAN ISLANDS

DESCRIPTION

The Cayman Islands, which form a dependency of Jamaica, consist of three islands—Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac—lying between 79° 45' and 81° 25' W. longitude and 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. latitude, and having a total area of about 100 square miles. They were discovered by Columbus on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession soon after the conquest of Jamaica in the middle of the seventeenth century and the islands were mainly colonised from Jamaica, though many English and Scottish mariners, shipwrecked on the coast of Cuba, settled on the islands.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is considerably larger than in other parts of the West Indies.
The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, with a varying breadth from 4 to 7 miles, and has an area of 76 square miles. The estimated population of the islands is 6,670, of which some 5,311 live in Grand Cayman, where Georgetown, the capital town, with a population of 1,462, is situated.

The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized deep-water harbours.

CLIMATE

The climate from November to March is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, but during the summer months it is hot, with southerly winds. Mosquitoes abound in the summer. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1949 was 52.02 inches, the average annual rainfall being about 60 inches.

The more recent hurricanes at the islands occurred in October, 1944; November, 1932; September, 1917; August, 1909; and August, 1903—previous to this there was a severe hurricane in October, 1876. During 1935 a modern meteorological station was erected at Georgetown, and observations taken form an important study of meteorological phenomena in the Caribbean, especially in connection with hurricanes.

CONSTITUTION

The Government is administered by a commissioner who is also judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 27) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members, known as vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly under the presidency of the Commissioner. Elections are held biennially.

The present constitution of this Assembly of Justices and Vestry is over 100 years old and the centenary was commemorated by a special issue of postage stamps in 1932.

COMMUNICATIONS

A regular three-weekly steam-ship service and a weekly air service is maintained from Georgetown with Kingston, Jamaica. There is also communication by sailing and motor vessels with the ports of Central America and the United States.

There are motorable roads connecting every district in both Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac.

There are two wireless stations: Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and Stake Bay, Cayman Brac; the latter established in 1936, the former in 1935. The deferred rate to all Empire countries is 4½d. per word and to the United States of America 7d. per word.

EDUCATION

Education is in charge of a Board of Education which receives an annual grant from the public revenue. Thirteen public elementary schools are maintained, with a roll of 952 pupils and an average attendance of 782.

FINANCES

| Year    | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1943/44 | £27,932 | £22,137     |
| 1944/45 | £21,155 | £28,533     |
| 1945/46 | £29,380 | £23,106     |

| 1948/49 | £36,372 | £32,481     |
| 1949/50 | £39,278 | £37,973     |

The public debt amounts to £5,530, being made up of loans by the Jamaica Government (a) in 1933 to assist in repairing damage caused by the hurricane of 1932; (b) in 1938 for the construction of certain works of improvement in the dependency.

The dependency has £30,109 invested as a reserve fund and £2,245 as a hurricane fund.

INDUSTRIES, TRADE AND CUSTOMS

The chief industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle—or "turtling," as it is called. These turtles are brought to the island and placed in "crawls" to recover and fatten before export. The total number of turtle exported in 1949 amounted to 3,205, valued at £9,615.

The people are first-class shipbuilders and many fine schooners are built in these islands for local use and sale abroad.

Georgetown is a port of registry and 5 sailing vessels, 16 motor vessels and 3 steam vessels, with an aggregate net tonnage of 5,191, are on the registry of shipping there.

The islands are in some parts fruitful and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honeycombed limestone and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found.

Many of the islanders find employment on the mainland of America and in foreign vessels, supporting their families in Cayman by remittances from abroad.

An ad valorem customs duty of 12½ per cent. is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. The revenue derived from these duties amounted to £18,056 in 1948-49.

There is a British preferential tariff on certain articles.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

Situation and Area

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. latitude and 71° and 72° 37' W. longitude at the extreme south-eastern end of the Bahama chain. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos group by the 22-mile wide Turks Islands Passage. The combined area of both groups is about 166 square miles.

Climate

The climate is equable and healthy and rarely unpleasantly hot owing to the constant trade winds.

The mean maximum and minimum temperatures during 1948 were 64° and 93° respectively, the extreme range being from 60° to 96°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1949 amounted to 21'58 inches, and the average rainfall for the last five years was 18'66 inches.

Hurricanes strike the dependency periodically, almost always during the month of September. There were severe hurricanes in 1926, 1928 and 1945, the last being the worst within living memory. The wind speed exceeded 150 miles an hour.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., at Grand Turk; reports on local weather conditions are sent to Miami every six hours during the 24.

General Description

Geographically the islands are part of the Bahama chain, and have the same flat characteristics. Economically they are divided into two distinct parts, the salt-producing islands of Grand Turk, Salt Cay and South Caicos; and the remainder of the Caicos group, where the people are peasant farmers and fishermen. Food supplies for the salt-producing islands are imported from abroad, but during the winter months some vegetables are sent to these islands from the outlying Caicos settlements.

Great efforts have been and are being made to improve diet by greatly increased imports of fruit, vegetables, including potatoes, sweet potatoes and yams, and also live steers, refrigerated meat and semi-luxuries such as ice cream. Almost the whole of these imports are obtained from soft currency areas.

Great efforts are also being made to alleviate to at least some extent, the exceptional dullness of life in these poor, remote and barren islands by improving social services, by better library and sports facilities and lastly by voluntarily operated cinema units. One unit is in operation and a second is on order and a third planned. This last venture is proving most popular.

The principal industry is the manufacture and export of solar evaporated salt. The industry has been carried on with varying success for the greater part of three centuries. The principal needs are for reorganisation and new capital to enable the industry to produce salt of uniformly high grade and to ship the salt cheaply and at a high loading rate. Plans for reorganisation have met with every sort of difficulty and discouragement, but are once more well advanced. Shipments have in the past averaged about 40,000 tons, rising to about 70,000 tons in 1947 and 1948. An even higher rate should be possible when reorganisation is completed.

Subsidiary industries are production of hand cleaned sisal for sale in Jamaica and crawfish which are exported to Miami. The flesh of large shell fish known as conchs is also exported dried to Haiti. The export of processed and deep frozen crawfish, conch and scale fish to the United States offers very considerable possibilities. The export of sponge is now almost nil, due to disease.

Religion

The Turks and Caicos Islands are in the diocese of the Bahamas. The Anglican rector lives at Grand Turk, and there are Anglican churches at Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour.

There are Methodist and Baptist churches at Grand Turk, Salt Cay, South Caicos, and Blue Hills, and Baptist churches, visited regularly by the minister, in all the other Caicos settlements.

History

The Turks and Caicos Islands were discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon. From 1678 they were visited by Bermudians who remained in Grand Turk during the summers to rake salt and returned to Bermuda during winter. In 1710 the salt-rakers were driven out by the Spaniards, but they in their turn drove the Spaniards from the islands. During the next 40 years brushes with the Spaniards were a frequent occurrence, but the salt-rakers armed their ships and gave as good as they got.

In 1753 and again in 1764 the French attacked the salt-rakers and took them to Haiti as prisoners. A treaty between the French and English commissioners in Jamaica ended these depredations.

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the southern states of America after the War of Independence. Cotton was cultivated until 1812 but drought and insect plagues caused
the industry to fail, and after the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, leaving their former slaves in possession.

In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, in spite of vigorous protests by the Bermudian salt-rakers. These protests were continued until 1848 when a separate charter was granted to the islands, divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas.

After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 addressed a petition to Her Majesty praying that the islands might be annexed to the colony of Jamaica. The Legislative Council of Jamaica agreed, and on 1st January, 1874, the Turks and Caicos Islands were annexed to Jamaica, and still remain one of its dependencies.

The Turks and Caicos Islands are subject to hurricanes. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1908, 1926, 1928 and 1945, the most severe being those of 1866 and 1945. Over £40,000 was spent in repairing damage done by the hurricane of 1945 and even this sum was inadequate to deal with more than part of the damage. Generous help was received from the British and Jamaica Governments and from subscribers in Jamaica, Bermuda and Nassau.

During the second world war an anti-aircraft battery was stationed at Grand Turk. The last garrison had been withdrawn over 80 years before when a detachment of the Ist West India Regiment under the command of Ensign Nolan was withdrawn to Nassau. A temporary air base was established by the United States Army Air Force on South Caicos Island in 1944 and an airstrip constructed. The base and strip were handed over to the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1947. A small airstrip for light aircraft was also constructed at Grand Turk during 1947.

**CONSTITUTION**

In the Order-in-Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This board now consists of three official and three unofficial nominated members appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. The Commissioner is ex-officio President of the Board. The board is empowered to make ordinances for financial measures and for matters of a local character, but these ordinances do not become law until the Governor has given his assent to them.

Laws passed by the legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenue and expenditure of the Dependency are kept distinct from those of Jamaica.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The Dependency is administered by a Commissioner who is selected by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. The Commissioner is President of the Legislative Board. There is a District Commissioner for the Caicos Islands stationed at Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos and a Government Officer at Salt Cay.

There are a number of local Boards of which the most important are the Board of Education and the Prison Board.

District Boards have been appointed at the main settlements in the outlying Caicos Islands. Their members are appointed by the Commissioner and they are empowered to make rules for the control of public health, water supplies, and the cultivation of land.

The revenue is derived mainly from the import duties, and from the salt industry. Licences and other forms of taxation are becoming an increasingly fruitful source of revenue.

The Magistrate holds court weekly at Grand Turk, and monthly at Salt Cay and South Caicos.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

Medical officers are stationed at Grand Turk and South Caicos. They are seconded for periods of one year from the Jamaica Medical Service.

There are 12 Government elementary schools in the Dependency, with 964 pupils enrolled in 1949 and an average attendance of 669. Education is compulsory up to the age of 14 at Grand Turk, Salt Cay and South Caicos.

There is a Government senior school at Grand Turk which takes children up to the school certificate standard. Education is supervised by the Board of Education of which the Commissioner is Chairman.

The Prison Board is responsible for the welfare of prisoners. The improvement of prison conditions is being actively pursued.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There is a monthly mail, passenger, and freight service with Jamaica.

Air mail is sent fortnightly through the Dominican Republic and is forwarded by air to Jamaica. All mail to and from the dependency is at present routed via Jamaica.

An air strip, built during the war by the American army on South Caicos, was handed over to the Government of the dependency in 1947. A small air strip, 2,200 feet in length, suitable for small aircraft, was constructed at Grand Turk during the same year. The fortnightly mail service carries a limited number of passengers to and from Ciudad Trujillo in the Dominican Republic where communications can be made with the following air lines: B.W.I.A., Pan-American, K.L.M.

Grand Turk is an important junction of Cable and Wireless (West Indies), Ltd. Their cables connect with Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda, and thence via Canada with London and all parts of the world. The company also has a regular wireless service with Ciudad Trujillo, and with the Government wireless station at Salt Cay and South Caicos. On notification contact can be made with ships at sea, but no regular ship's watch is kept.

A direct radio telephone service between Grand Turk and Jamaica was opened by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., on 1st December, 1947. Secrecy gear was installed in 1949.
