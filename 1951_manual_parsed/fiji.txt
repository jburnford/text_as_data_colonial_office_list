FIJI

SITUATION AND AREA

The colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 21° S., and between longitude 178° W. and 176° E. It is distant from Sydney 1,743 miles, and from Auckland 1,148 miles. The Tonga or Friendly Islands lie 420 miles to the south-east of Suva, and
Samoa 645 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. There are about 250 islands in the group; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotuma consists of all islands, rocks and reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,011 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,137 square miles, Taveuni, 168 square miles, Kandavu, 158 square miles, Koro, 40 square miles, Ngau, 54 square miles, and Ovalau, 40 square miles. The total area of the colony (including Rotuma, 18 square miles) is approximately 7,040 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

**CLIMATE**

The climate of Fiji is oceanic. The south-east trade-wind blows from May to November and during the remaining months the direction of the wind is variable. Between December and April when hot northerly winds blow from the equator the temperature may rise to 92° and the humidity may reach saturation point. The total average annual rainfall varies in the well-defined "wet" and "dry" zones from 140 to 60 inches and the temperature varies from a minimum of 59° to a maximum of 96°.

There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The highest temperature at Suva in 1949 was 94·9° on 14th January, and the lowest 63·0° on 14th August. The total rainfall was 220·54 inches and the average annual rainfall over a period of 61 years is 122·96 inches. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising, in many places, more or less abruptly from the shore. The highest point in the Colony is Mount Victoria (4,341 feet) in Viti Levu. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and were probably mostly under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger islands, i.e., the leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills and plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Gold is produced from the Tavua and Vunda districts in the north and north-western sections of Viti Levu Island; prospecting activities are in progress in these and other localities. The gold is generally associated with flow-rocks of Tertiary age or their tuffaceous equivalents. It occurs in the free condition, associated with sulphides, and as telluride. Base metal ores, carrying low precious-metal values, are known to occur in various parts of the colony, but production has not yet resulted therefrom. The mining industry occupies second place in the industries of the colony. In 1948, 118,536 fine ounces of gold valued at £F1,012,324 and 37,920 fine ounces of silver valued at £F6,926 were exported.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed launches, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Singatoka, the Nandi, and Mba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The largest river, the Ndreketi, is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "ndalo" or taro (*Colocasia antiquorum*).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

The principal island of the Rotuma group is approximately nine miles long by three miles broad and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore are three islets, Hatana, Hofliua and Uea. None of these is now inhabited, although people visit them occasionally to cut copra or to collect seabirds' eggs.

**POPULATION**

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. A census was taken on 3rd October, 1946. The estimated population at 31st October, 1948, was:

|                | Males | Females | Total |
|----------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Europeans      | 3,554 | 2,572   | 6,126 |
| Part-Europeans | 3,475 | 3,237   | 6,712 |
| Fijians        | 64,320| 62,330  | 126,650|
| Polynesians, Melanesians |       |         |       |
| Micronesians   | 2,432 | 1,722   | 4,154 |
| Indians        | 71,526| 62,415  | 133,941|
| Rotumans       | 1,826 | 1,755   | 3,581 |
| Chinese        | 2,230 | 918     | 3,148 |
| Others         | 348   | 295     | 643   |
| **Total**      | **149,711** | **135,244** | **284,955** |

The European population of Suva and its suburbs at the October, 1946 census was 2,266.

The births among the Fijian population in 1949 totalled 4,500 and the deaths 1,894. The birth rate was 35·53 and the death rate 14·95 per mil.

**RELIGION**

The European and Fijian population is predominantly Christian. Most of the Indians in the colony are Hindus, but there are Muslim and Christian minorities.
The numerically strongest Christian denomination is the Methodist. The Roman Catholic and Seventh Day Adventist missions have established stations throughout the colony. The Roman Catholic Mission was made a bishopric in 1887. Suva is the centre of the Anglican diocese of Polynesia, and the site of a pro-cathedral. There are Anglican churches at Levuka, Lautoka and Lambassa. A station for Solomon islanders living in Fiji has been established at Wailoku.

There is a Presbyterian church in Suva.

The 1946 census revealed the following figures of adherents to the undermentioned Christian denominations:

- Church of England: 3,832
- Methodist: 109,944
- Presbyterian: 736
- Roman Catholic: 18,920
- Seventh Day Adventists: 2,339

Of the Indian population at that date, 99,404 were Hindus and 16,932 were Mohammedan.

**History**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1774. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the *Bounty*, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1858, Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Europeans set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a parliament elected. The parliament and the government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the ministry latterly governed without the aid of the parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in 1873 the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty’s consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, in 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in 1874 to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the chief of Mbau, Maafu, who was chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taveuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated 10th October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, which has a fine harbour.

Rotuma was discovered by the *Pandora* in 1793, and named Granville Island. In 1879 the three principal Rotuman chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain and they were annexed 13th May, 1881.

**Constitution**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd April, 1937. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Financial Secretary, together with two other officials and four unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

When a vacancy occurs amongst the unofficial members of Executive Council the unofficial members of Legislative Council may recommend one of their number to fill the vacancy. There are European, Fijian and Indian members of Executive Council.

Under the Letters Patent, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, three *ex officio* members (official), not more than 13 nominated official members, five European members (three elected and two nominated), five native nominated members and five Indian members (three elected and two nominated).

**Administration**

Fiji is divided into three administrative districts, under the control of District Commissioners, who have one or more District Officers to assist them. Headquarters are at Suva in the Southern District, Lautoka in the Western District, Lambasa in the Northern District.

Each administrative district contains a number of Fijian provinces, of which there are 14 altogether in the colony. A District Commissioner represents the Secretary for Fijian Affairs in matters connected with Fijian administration within his District.

Suva, the capital of Fiji, is controlled by a Town Council, constituted under the Local Government (Towns) Ordinance, 1947, having three European councillors elected by the European electors, three Indian councillors elected by the Indian electors and two councillors appointed by the Governor.

Lautoka, the main centre of the Western District is controlled by a Town Board constituted under the Towns Ordinance, 1935, and has two official and six unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

Levuka, the old capital of Fiji, is controlled by a Township Board, which, together with the Boards for the townships of Nausori, Mba, Lambasa and Nandi, is constituted under the Townships Ordinance which provides for the nomination by the Governor of both official and unofficial members.

The Fijians retain a large share of self-government. Their system of district and provincial councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by annual meetings of the high chiefs and other representatives of each province. The Council of Chiefs makes recommendations on Fijian affairs, and bills affecting Fijians may be referred to this council for consideration before being submitted to the Legislative Council. There is a Fijian Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs (chairman), the five Fijian members of Legislative Council, and a legal adviser. The Board submits to the Governor recommendations and proposals for the benefit of the Fijian people and considers questions relating
to their good government and well-being referred to it by the Governor. It has the power to make regulations providing for the peace, order and good government of Fijians, for communal services, the provision of public services and the imposition of rates, for sanitation and fishing and regarding the jurisdiction, powers and procedure of Fijian Courts and magistrates civil and criminal cases. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council, but provisional approval may be granted by the Secretary for Fijian Affairs. The Board is the controlling financial authority in Fijian administration and has power to regulate the conditions of employment of persons in its service. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs is the executive officer of Fijian local government. He is directly responsible to the Governor and, in appropriate matters, to the Legislative Council for the good government of the Fijians as a whole.

In Rotuma, where the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, a District Officer is the chief executive authority. The District Officer is ex officio a magistrate with powers to hold magistrates courts of the second class, and may take evidence in indictable cases for transmission to the Supreme Court.

The main island is divided into seven districts over each of which is a chief appointed by the Governor, and is administered by the district officer with the assistance of a Council of Chiefs, held monthly. The Council, an advisory body, consists of the District Officer (chairman), the seven district chiefs, the native medical practitioner, one teacher, and one representative from each district.

A Rotuma Regulation Board, consisting of the District Officer and between five and ten Rotumans makes regulations relating to the good government and well-being of the natives. All such regulations are subject to approval by the Legislative Council of Fiji.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

The Education Ordinance (Cap. 103), passed in 1929, constituted the Department of Education, and established the Board of Education, consisting of the Director of Education and not more than eight other members nominated by the Governor. The ordinance gives very wide powers to the Board to control all phases of education. The most important are the registering of schools and teachers, the allocation of grants-in-aid and the determination of the instruction to be given.

The Education Rating Ordinance (Cap. 104) authorises the levying of a special rate in the education districts of Suva and Levuka to meet one-half of the net cost incurred by the Government in maintaining European schools within the limits of the districts.

There are two grammar schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, and a public school in Levuka for boys and girls, all under Government control and with hostels attached. The roll number during 1949 at the two grammar schools was 633, and at the Levuka public school 244 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School provides for the higher education of Fijians, and is maintained from public revenue: the school is at present in temporary quarters, its buildings having been requisitioned during the war for a military hospital; but a most attractive new coastal site has been selected, and building has commenced.

A secondary school for Indians (mainly boys) is maintained from public funds near Lautoka.

Schools for primary education may be conducted by any properly constituted and approved authority or by Government. Six provincial schools were established by the Government over 20 years ago as boarding schools for Fijians. These schools are consolidated in a large intermediate boarding school at Londoni on the eastern coast of Viti Levu. Two remain, one on the island of Taveuni and the other on the island of Kandavu. An intermediate school for Fijian girls was established in 1948.

A technical school for all races is maintained at Suva and a similar school has been constructed at Levuka and is in operation.

In 1949 there were 431 schools in the Colony including 279 Fijian registered and recognised schools, with an average enrolment of 26,229, and 118 registered and recognised schools for Indians, with an average enrolment of 20,647.

Teacher training in the Colony is conducted at a Government Teachers' Training College with a roll of 200 students, Fijians and Indians of both sexes.

Information Services

The Public Relations Office performs the triple task of telling the people of Fiji about Government proposals and achievements, providing news about Fiji for use overseas, and passing on to the people of the colony information about British Commonwealth affairs. It is the channel through which all official statements pass to the press and the local broadcasting station.

The Public Relations Office provides local broadcast and telegraphed news services in English and prepares and presents programmes of entertainment, news, and general information, to Fijian and Indian listeners in Fijian and Hindustani respectively. Its staff edits Na Mata, the Government newspaper for Fijians.

A weekly cyclostyled bulletin, "News from Fiji", is sent to overseas information departments; newspapers and news agencies. A printed pamphlet, "Fiji Information", is published quarterly.

A photographic section supplies photographs for use in local and overseas publicity and prints are available for sale in Fiji.

Close liaison is maintained with the unofficial Fiji Publicity Board and Tourist Bureau, which gives advice and help to tourists and visitors to the Colony.

Health

The Central Medical School in Suva, which has a teaching staff of one whole-time medical officer, who is the principal, an assistant principal and 14 honorary lecturers, was founded in 1884 for the training of Fijian youths; but since 1928 its benefits have been available to other Western Pacific territories, and its graduates, now numbering 296, include Fijians, Fiji Indians, Western Samoans, Eastern Samoans, Tongans, Gilbertese, Ellice Islanders, Solomon Islanders, New Hebrideans, Rotumans, Nauruans, Cook Islanders and Nieué Islanders. Construction of a larger central medical school and hostel to accommodate 70 students is to start during 1951.

From this school are sent out native assistant medical practitioners who work among their own people, not only treating the sick and attending to native health conditions in the villages, but also
forming a bridge for the conveyance of European medical thought to the native mind: a system which has been responsible more than any other single factor for winning the confidence of the Fijians in modern medicine and surgery.

In several of the provinces, hospitals and dispensaries for the use of Fijians and others have been opened and in each of these is an assistant medical practitioner either in sole charge or acting as house surgeon under the European medical officer. In addition, there are well-equipped general hospitals for all races at Suva, Lautoka, Levuka and Lambasa. The military hospital at Tamavua was converted into a tuberculosis hospital in 1946 with 170 beds with room for expansion. There is a public mental hospital in Suva, and on the island of Makongai a colony for the segregation and treatment of those afflicted with leprosy.

All these institutions are owned and maintained by the Government. The hospital at Makongai deserves special mention, as it has achieved world fame because of its success in the treatment of leprosy. The nursing system there, the personnel of which is drawn from the Roman Catholic Order of Mary, is of outstanding merit. The average number of patients is 680. Other territories in the South West Pacific contribute towards the cost of the maintenance of patients admitted from their territories.

In 1923, with the assistance of £20,500 subscribed by the public, the Colonial War Memorial Hospital was erected on a commanding site within the town boundaries of Suva. It is controlled by Government and staffed with four resident medical officers and an adequate number of trained and pupil nurses. It now accommodates 274 patients of all races under the care of Government Medical and Surgical Specialists and their assistants. Its equipment and general facilities conform with the standards of modern general hospitals in other countries.

A teaching branch of the Colonial War Memorial Hospital which is of ever-growing importance is its school for training of non-European nurses in general nursing, obstetrics and public health nursing. The number of pupil nurses has been increased to 120 and a principal and one tutor-sister undertake a large portion of the teaching, working directly under the supervision of the matron and nursing superintendent. Construction of a new nurses' training school and hostel of modern design is expected to start in 1951. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital, Tamavua Hospital and the Suva Health Office are available as a post-graduate centre not only for nurses trained in Fiji but for non-European nurses trained in other Western Pacific territories and for graduates of the Central Medical School.

Lautoka Hospital with 112 beds is another school for non-European nurses and here 60 pupil nurses are in training. A tutor-sister has been appointed to take charge, and the curriculum is identical to that at the Colonial War Memorial Central Nursing School, Suva.

The Methodist Mission operates a 35 bed hospital at Ba where Indian girls are trained as nurses. The nursing curriculum of this hospital also conforms with the nursing curriculum in use in the Government hospitals.

Owing to the high death-rate among Fijian infants and young children, the Government instituted in 1927 a special infant welfare organisation. It is based on putting as much responsibility as possible into the hands of the natives, and has proved most successful. Since its inception there has been a steady decline in the infant mortality rate of the Fijian people. The work of the trained staff, which is both European and native, is greatly helped by a system under which, in almost every village, women volunteer workers are appointed to take care of the children of that village.

In recent years a special mosquito control branch of the Medical Department has been established. Its first task was to undertake clearing and drainage work in the vicinity of ports and airfields so as to lessen the danger of the introduction of the *anopheles* mosquito from the malarial areas to the north of Fiji, with which there was a great increase of air and sea traffic during the war.

A survey extending over a period of five years to determine the incidence of mocro filaria in the native population has just been completed. Over 69,000 blood tests have been made and the incidence by age group and by sex is now being calculated. As the survey in each village and province has been completed, a campaign to eradicate the local filarial carrying mosquito was instituted. The results of the re-check survey which is now beginning will be awaited with interest to ascertain the merits of the measures adopted to reduce the mosquito population in the villages.

A representative committee of Fiji citizens decided that the most appropriate war memorial would be a fund to assist in the control of tuberculosis. As a result of their appeal over £80,000 have been contributed for this purpose which will provide for the establishment of inexpensive annexes associated with district and rural hospitals for the segregation of active cases of this disease. The tuberculosis survey which has been in operation for 1½ years has given a true indication of the seriousness of tuberculosis in Fiji. So far, over 25,000 Mantoux tests have been performed and the administration of B.C.G. vaccine for selected groups of individuals was introduced in September, 1949. Prescribed courses in auxiliary medical sciences have been organised and students from the surrounding territories are now able to follow courses leading to certificates in sanitary inspection, pharmacy, laboratory technicians, radiography and filariasis and mosquito inspection. In addition to these courses, post-graduate studies of Assistant Medical Practitioners are given in tuberculosis, eye diseases, ante-natal and infant welfare work and public health.

Health education has consisted in the preparation of pamphlets on lunches for school children, circulation of health films and wide distribution of health posters. Health posters are now designed and produced within the Colony by the silk screen process.

Labour

The Labour Department is in charge of labour welfare and derives its status and authority from the Labour Ordinance, 1947. The executive staff consists of the Commissioner of Labour, two labour officers and four labour inspectors. The department carries out the usual functions of labour departments in the colonies, including the promotion of harmony in industrial relations and the safeguarding of the general welfare of workers. The question of old age pensions is under consideration, and meantime destitution is dealt with by assistance from public funds. The
Industrial Associations Ordinance (Cap. 79) and the Industrial Disputes (Conciliation and Arbitration) Ordinance (Cap. 80), provide machinery for collective bargaining. The Workmen's Compensation Ordinance (Cap. 81) compensates for accidents throughout industry, including workers in agricultural employment. Compensation for occupational diseases is also provided. Factory legislation is under consideration.

Numerous Labour Conventions have been given statutory force in the Labour Ordinance, 1947, including:

- Minimum age for admission of children to industrial employment. Night work of young persons. Minimum age for children employed at sea. Rights of association and combination of agricultural workers. Workmen's compensation in agriculture. Minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers. Compulsory medical examination of young persons employed at sea. Equality of treatment for national and foreign workers as regards workmen's compensation for accidents. Workmen's compensation for occupational diseases. Employment of women in underground work in mines. The regulation of certain special systems of recruiting workers. Written contracts of employment of indigenous workers. Penal sanctions for breaches of contract of employment by indigenous workers. Forced or compulsory labour. Employment of women during the night.

The colony has accepted the recommendations of the 1944 and 1945 International Labour Conferences regarding minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories, and the Labour Ordinance, 1947, takes the necessary powers.

Further information may be found in the annual report of the Commissioner of Labour.

**Communications**

**Roads and Tramways**

There is no railway in the colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. owns various tramlines connecting with estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. On Viti Levu a circular all-weather motor road 323 miles long connects Suva with Tailevu, Tavua, Mba, Lautoka, Nandi, Singatoka and Navua. Branch roads afford access to other centres of settlement, including the mining area of Vatukoula and the hill station at Nandarivatu.

There are 19 miles of road on Ovalau and 40 miles on Taveuni.

On the island of Vanua Levu there are two disconnected road systems, one following the coast for 30 miles from Savusavu and the other connecting Lambasa with settlements in the vicinity.

**Shipping**

There is a direct cargo service from the United Kingdom after having been broken off during the war years. Six vessels on this service arrived in the Colony in 1949 carrying 23,443 tons of general cargo.

There is a regular steamship communication with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and U.S.A., and the inter-island service is maintained by a regular steamer and cutter schedule.

Suva is a port of registry under the Merchant Shipping Act.

The number of local vessels trading within the Colony and holding sea-going certificates from the Marine Board during 1949 was:

| Owned by          | No. | Tons   |
|-------------------|-----|--------|
| Europeans         | 58  | 2,262  |
| Native (Fijians)  | 10  | 134    |
| Others            | 25  | 407    |
| **Total**         | **93** | **2,803** |

The number of merchant vessels entered from overseas at the three ports of entry in the Colony during the year 1949 was 174, the total registered tonnage being 543,100.

**Air**

There are two airfields on Viti Levu, the main Island of the Fiji Group, one near Nandi on the West Coast and the other at Nausori, 135 and 13 miles respectively from Suva; a seaplane base is also operated at Lauthala Bay, close to Suva. The air services between Fiji and New Zealand, Australia, Tonga, Western Samoa, Cook Islands, Norfolk and New Caledonia, are regular but subject to variation in time-table. An interinsular service was inaugurated during the year and maintains a weekly time-table in the linking of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.

**Postal and Telegraphs**

Overseas surface mails are despatched via New Zealand every twenty-eight days and once every two months by the Canadian-Australian vessel "Aorangi" to Hawaii, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The services of vessels calling irregularly are also used.

Air mails are despatched to New Zealand, Canada, and the United States twice weekly and to Australia thrice weekly. Samoa, Tonga and certain other island groups are served fortnightly by air.

Air mails are despatched to New Zealand, Canada and the United States twice weekly and to Australia three times weekly. Samoa, Tonga and certain other island groups are served fortnightly by air. Air mails for other countries are forwarded via Australia.

Agreements are in force for the exchange of money orders and parcels with Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Tonga; for parcels only with the United States and Pakistan; and for money orders only with the British Solomon Islands Protectorate and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.

British postal orders are issued and paid at Suva and four other post offices.

Magneto telephone exchanges are in operation at Suva, Nausori, Navua, Singatoka, Nandi, Lautoka, Mba, Vatukoula, Tavua, Rakiraki and Korovou on the main island of Viti Levu: at Levuka on Ovalau: and at Lambasa on Vanua Levu. The exchanges on Viti Levu are linked by a system of land-line trunk circuits encircling the island except for a gap between Korovou and Rakiraki. A three-channel carrier telephone system operates between Suva and Lautoka: one of these carrier channels is permanently rented to the New Zealand Civil Aviation Department. An automatic telephone exchange is on order for Suva, and should be in operation in 1952.

Internal radio stations have been established at the following places:-Suva, Lautoka, Nayavu, Levuka, Moturiki, Makogai, Vunisca, Lambasa, Savusavu, Nambouwalu, Mbutha Bay, Rami
Island, Waiyevo, Lomaloma, Lakemba, Rotuma (fixed stations owned and operated by the Fiji Government); M.V. "Andi Maopa", M.V. "Viti II", M.V. "Dengei" (Fiji Government ships); Nandi airport, Undu Point, Ono-i-Lau, Yasawa-i-rara (N.Z. Meteorological Department stations); Wakaia Island, Katafanga Island, Nambavatu (privately owned stations). Services are confined to circuits between Suva and other Government and private stations for civil traffic, and Nandi airport and meteorological stations for weather traffic, except in emergency. Some of the circuits are normally worked morse, though they are equipped for telephony.

Equipment for the following additional Fiji Government radio-telephone stations was ordered in 1950 and the stations are all expected to be in operation by the end of 1951: Mbengga Island, Matuku Island, Kambara Island, Ngau Island, Koro Island, and Wainunu, Natewa and Ndreketi, all on the Island of Vanua Levu.

An internal telegraph service is maintained over the various land-line and/or radio circuits.

Telecommunications between Fiji and overseas countries, as well as to ocean-going shipping and certain smaller ships operating in Fiji waters, is maintained by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., by means of submarine cable and radio. It is expected that by the end of 1951 this concern will have established a radio-telephone service from Suva to Australia and New Zealand.

**PUBLIC FINANCE**

The Public Debt of the Colony comprises the following loans of which the last two were raised locally.

| Loan                          | Amount |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| 5% Public Purposes Loan       | £190,263 |
| 4% Public Works Loan          | £172,046 |

A comparison of the Assets and Liabilities of the Colony for the years 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1949 is as follows:

| Year | Assets (£F) | Liabilities (£F) | Balance being excess of Assets over Liabilities at 31st December (£F) |
|------|------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1946 | 3,150,480  | 2,163,004        | 987,475                                                        |
| 1947 | 3,643,412  | 2,270,359        | 1,373,053                                                      |
| 1948 | 4,486,460  | 2,698,306        | 1,788,154                                                      |
| 1949 | 5,039,416  | 2,827,469        | 2,211,947                                                      |

The main heads of taxation and the yield from each during the year 1949 were as follows: Customs Duties including Import Duties, Port and Customs Service Tax, Wharfage Light and Tonnage Duties, £F1,451,391; Income Tax, £F886,691; Licences, £F84,187; Residential Tax, £F48,526; Entertainment Tax, £F8,840; Stamp Duties, £F11,751; Death and Gift Duties, £F28,204.

The main heads of expenditure in 1949 were as follows: Charges on account of Public Debt, £F133,857; Pensions, Gratuities and compassionate allowances, £F132,418; Departmental annually recurrent expenditure, £F1,796,149; Works annually recurrent, £F302,519; Works Extraordinary, £F84,934; expenditure from Surplus Balances, £F204,922.

Note.—1949 figures estimated.

Customs Duties account for just over half of the revenue of the Colony and practically all imports are taxed.

The Customs tariff is, in general, on an ad valorem basis, and until the end of 1947 duty was assessed on the value of goods at the port of shipment, in other words f.o.b. value. Practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the manufactured value and the completion was carried out within the Empire. A few special items require 50 or 75 per cent., British content. The 6 per cent. Port and Customs Service Tax on imports was abolished at the end of 1947 and the basis of assessment of customs duty on imported goods altered to c.i.f. value at the port of destination. The Port and Customs Service Tax of 1 per cent. on exports still remains, but the export duty of 10s. per ton on sugar was not renewed as from March of 1949. In 1948 the import duties on certain foodstuffs of British origin were removed, together with most of those on machinery of British origin required for developing primary industries. The duties on similar foodstuffs and machinery of foreign origin have been reduced proportionately.

The main heads of expenditure in 1948 were as follows: Charges on account of Public Debt, £F88,393; Pensions, Gratuities and Compassionate allowances, £100,552; Departmental annually recurrent expenditure, £F1,754,979; Works annually recurrent, £F280,045; Works Extraordinary, £F87,861; expenditure from Surplus Balances, £F150,206.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Legislation in 1933 and 1934 provided for the issue of Government currency notes and coin which follow the United Kingdom currency denominations.

The Fiji pound is linked to sterling by law at the fixed rate of £F111 = £100 sterling.
The circulation at 31st December, 1949, was:

Notes £3,355,863
Coin 253,182

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva and Lautoka, and four agencies; the Bank of New Zealand has a branch at Suva.

A Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908.

The Head Office of the Bank is in Suva and there are 25 branches. Depositors total, 43,159, and the balance to their credit on 31st December, 1949, was £1,376,959.

Note.—1949 figures estimated.

INDUSTRIES, TRADE AND CUSTOMS

The trade and commerce depend on the three staple industries, viz. (1) the cultivation, manufacture and export of sugar and its by-products; (2) the cultivation, manufacture and export of copra and its by-products; (3) the mining of gold.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were, copra, cotton (Sea-Island) and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value till the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. To-day the cotton industry is extinct.

Exports of the produce of the colony in 1949 totalled £F6,419,501. The principal exports, together with their by-products, were sugar, copra and gold in that order.

The quantities and value exported in 1949 were:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sugar    | 110,968 £F3,205,524 |
| Sugar by-product (molasses) | 27,092 £F27,092 |

138,060 tons £F3,232,616

The other principal exports were:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Bananas | 332,358 bunches £F119,024 |
| Canned pineapples | 1,542,911 lb £F62,000 |
| Biscuits | 876,054 lb £F33,803 |
| Ground nuts | 283 tons £F22,187 |
| Pineapple juice | 415,328 lb £F13,046 |
| Hides | 6,603 number £F11,613 |
| Trocas shell | 217 tons £F9,007 |
| Silver | 32,481 ozs £F6,783 |
| Green ginger | 369,704 lb £F4,959 |
| Bech-de-mer | 14,466 lb £F1,447 |

Dairying is an established industry which is responsible for two factories engaged in the manufacture of butter and ghee.

The manufacture of soap and biscuits are industries on an established footing and whilst the latter is capable of meeting a considerable proportion of the local requirements it also enjoys an increasing trade with the neighbouring Pacific islands.

Two mills are engaged in the production of coconut oil and other by-products of copra, such as coconut meal and margarine, and one mill in the production of candlenut oil. The latter is still in its infancy and the quantity of oil produced does not satisfy the local demands, but the proprietors of the mill have hopes of being in the position to export in the future. Candlenut oil has proved a worthy substitute for linseed oil in the mixing of paint.

The total trade of the Colony in 1949 was £F13,834,843, an amount which exceeds by £F100,947 the figure for 1948, the previous best year on record. The trade of the Colony has shown considerable progress over the years and as a comparison the value for 1939 was £F4,371,261 as against that for the year under review, an increase of £F9,463,582.

Comparative figures for the trade of the colony over a decade are as follows:

THE GAMBIA

SITUATION AND AREA

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but narrowing to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to two and a half miles between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary’s Island. There are 26 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 13 feet can at present proceed without trouble to MacCarthy Island. There is no bar to the Gambia River.

The seat of government is Bathurst, 13° 27′ N., 16° 34′ W., situated on St. Mary’s Island, a bank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony consists of the island of St. Mary and British Kombo. It also comprised Albreda, the Cedet Mile, the territories of Brefet and Bajana, and MacCarthy Island until 1946 when these lands were vested by order under the Protectorate Lands Ordinance, 1945, in the Native Authorities. MacCarthy Island forms a line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the Upper River and Lower River. The total area of the Colony is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey).

The Protectorate extends on both banks of the river for 250 miles from its mouth, and its area, including that of the parts of the Colony administered as Protectorate, is 3,964 square miles. St. Mary’s Island has an area of about 2,500 acres of dry land. A survey of the boundaries dividing the Gambia from the Senegal was completed by the Anglo-French Boundary Commission in 1905.

CLIMATE

The climate of the Gambia during the dry season from the middle of November to the middle of May is pleasant and generally healthy. During the wet season from June to October the conditions are much the same as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa. The wettest month is August, and the most unpleasant month, owing to the humidity, is October. In the interior, the temperature varies between 60° and 110° and in Bathurst between 60° and 100°.

The rainfall is extremely variable from year to year, ranging between 30 and 50 inches.
**POPULATION**

Figures for Bathurst are:

- 1911: 7,700
- 1921: 9,227
- 1931: 14,370
- 1944: 21,152

The large increase in 1944 may be attributed to the works undertaken by the services during the war years and the consequent influx of labour.

The figures for the Protectorate, from the assessment for tax purposes taken by Commissioners in 1949, were 246,886.

These figures are made up mainly from the following races:

- Mandingo: 100,565
- Wollof: 30,592
- Fula: 43,778
- Jola: 17,848
- Serahuli: 16,243

(See also under Administration.)

The Mandingoes derive their names from Manding, a town some 700 miles inland and towards the north-east boundary of Sierra Leone. They are almost all Mohammedans.

The Wollofs form the largest part of the population of Bathurst. Outside Bathurst they are found mainly on the north bank of the river.

The Fulbe, more commonly known as Fula, are the main breeders of cattle and are found chiefly in the Upper River Division. Their features are somewhat of the Arabic type and their skins are of a lighter colour than negroes. The Fulbe are sub-divided into nine sub-tribes, Fulbe Firdu, Jombo, Lorobo, Habobo, Hamanabi, Torodo, Jawando, Labo, Fulbe Futo, which fall into three linguistic divisions.

The Jolas came from Foni between the southern limit of Kombo and the north bank of the Casamance River. Their country runs in a northeasterly direction towards the south bank of the Gambia River as far as the mouth of the Bintang Creek. They were originally pagans but an increasing number are becoming Mohammedans.

The Serahulis are the most recent arrivals in the Gambia, having migrated from the interior of Senegal in the 19th century. They are found mainly in the extreme east of the Protectorate and are all Mohammedans.

The social organisation of the above-mentioned tribes is in the main based on the patrilineal kin group, segments of which are commonly scattered among a number of sometimes quite distant villages.

**RELIGION**

The people of the Colony and Protectorate are predominantly Mohammedan though in the Protectorate there are several pagan enclaves consisting mostly of Jolas and Fulas. The Christians are almost entirely confined to Bathurst where, according to the 1944 census of Bathurst, there are approximately 5,000 Christians out of a population of 21,000. These Christians are composed of Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Methodists, and a mission for each of these denominations has its headquarters in the town.

**HISTORY**

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators but they made no settlement.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in London and Exeter to trade with the Gambia. This company did not prosper. Its voyages were not slave trading ventures but were made for legitimate commerce. In 1618, King James I of England granted a charter to Sir Robert Rich and other London merchants. Their enterprise was entitled "The Company of Adventurers of London trading in Africa", and Fort James was built by them on a small island 17 miles above the island of Banjola (now St. Mary's).

About the year 1631 another British chartered company was formed, King Charles I having granted a charter to Sir B. Young, Sir R. Digby and others. This venture was responsible for supplying British settlements in the West Indies with slaves for working on the estates.

In 1662 King Charles II granted a charter to a third company known as "The Royal Adventurers of England trading in Africa". A few years later this company exhausted its capital and surrendered its charter. In 1672 a fourth company was incorporated under the name of "The Royal African Company," and it was not until 1752, after having in its early days reached the highest point of commercial prosperity which had been touched by England in Africa, that it was superseded by "The Company of Merchants." The right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles, 1783, which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. The year 1807 saw the abolition of the slave trade, and though "The Company of Merchants" lingered on with an annual subsidy, the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed on the island of Banjola by the English merchants who resided at Goree and in Senegal until those places were given up to the French by the Treaty of Paris (1814). The island was renamed St. Mary's and the town, which was laid out, took its name from Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State at that time. The streets to be inhabited first were named after Lord Wellington and his generals at Waterloo.

The settlement was subject to the government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a military commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court", administered the government. From 1822 to 1829 the commandant governed alone.

In December, 1829, the Secretary of State appointed Lieutenant Colonel Alex. Findlay, R.A.C. Corps, as Lieutenant Governor (the first) "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia". The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force, but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

The Gambia, in the year 1843, was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. Captain H. P. Seagram, R.N., was the first Governor of the Colony.
By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West African Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823 and named after Major-General Sir Charles MacCarthy, K.C.B., Governor-in-Chief of the British West African possessions; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions of 1840, 1850 and 1855.

In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection.

Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The Protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894, and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned, until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. There is a Commissioner in charge of each Division and each District is under a Head Chief.

**CONSTITUTION**

Under the Royal Instructions dated 29th November, 1946, and 26th November, 1947, the Executive Council of the colony consists of the Colonial Secretary as an *ex officio* member and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed; at the present time the appointed members include four officials and three African unofficials. The Governor is the President of the Council, and he may on any special occasion when he desires the opinion of any person within the Colony summon such person as an Extraordinary Member. This provision precludes the possibility of a person resident within the Protectorate being summoned as an Extraordinary Member.

Under the Gambia (Legislative Council) Order in Council dated 29th November, 1946, as amended by a further Order in Council dated 26th November, 1947, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor as President, three *ex officio* members (the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), such number of nominated official and unofficial members as may from time to time be appointed and one elected member representing the town of Bathurst and the Kombo St. Mary Division. At least one of the nominated unofficial members must be appointed to represent the Protectorate. The present composition of the Legislative Council includes six nominated unofficial members and three nominated official members. There is, thus, an unofficial majority on the Council.

Under the Gambia Protectorate Order in Council dated 29th November, 1946, made under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890, it is provided that the Executive Council for the Colony shall also be the Executive Council of the Protectorate.

In September, 1950, proposals by the Governor for certain constitutional changes were approved. Under these changes, which are expected to come into effect in the Spring of 1951, a Vice-President of the Legislative Council will be appointed and there will be 3, instead of one, elected members. An African may be appointed as Vice-President. The number of nominated members, official and unofficial, will remain unspecified, but it is expected that the total number of official members will be seven and of unofficial eight. The Colonial Secretary, Attorney General and Financial Secretary will remain as ex-officio members.

The Supreme Court of the Colony normally sits at Bathurst, but may sit in any part of the Colony. The High Court of the Protectorate exercises in the Protectorate the same jurisdiction as the Supreme Court exercises in the Colony. There is provision for trial by jury in the Colony, but provision is also made whereby the judge may sit with assessors in lieu of a jury. There is no provision for trial by jury in the Protectorate. The Colonial Magistrate exercises a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction in the Colony, and ranks as a first-class magistrate throughout the Protectorate. In the Protectorate, there is a Protectorate Court in every Division, the Commissioner in charge of the Division being a magistrate with first-class powers; provision is made whereby other suitable persons may be appointed magistrates with either first or second-class powers in the Protectorate. In Bathurst there is also the Mohamadan court presided over by the Cadi, which has jurisdiction to try cases, contentious or uncontentious, between or exclusively affecting Mohamadan natives, relating to civil status, marriage, succession, donations, testaments and guardianship.

In addition to these Courts there are throughout the Protectorate Native Tribunals established by warrant under the Native Tribunals Ordinance, 1933. These tribunals are of two grades, one having a greater jurisdiction than the other, but they correspond generally to the native courts or tribunals found in other Colonies and Protectorates. The Commissioner exercises a general power of revision, amounting in effect to appeal, over proceedings in Native Tribunals.

In all cases before all classes of Courts, local ideas and customs are taken into consideration whenever they are relevant to the issues.

**LAND**

The law relating to the tenure and management of lands in the Colony and Protectorate is contained in two ordinances enacted in 1945, the Colony Lands Ordinance and the Protectorate Lands Ordinance. The first is in effect a consolidating ordinance, and codifies the law as it has been for a long time.

There is a considerable amount of freehold land in the Colony; in addition there are a number of Crown leases, and the remainder of the land is occupied by the Crown. Generally, Crown leases are not granted for a greater period than 21 years in the first instance, and there is provision for revision of rent.

Prior to the enactment of the Protectorate Lands Ordinance, the Governor exercised over land in the Protectorate the same powers of disposition and management as he exercises over land in the Colony. The Protectorate Lands Ordinance, however, vests all Protectorate lands in the Native Authorities, to be held and administered for the common benefit, direct or indirect, of the communities concerned. The Ordinance makes strict provisions for the occupation of land by non-indigenes: no non-indigene may acquire a greater interest than a lease for 50 years in the first instance, and provision is made for rent revision. No Protectorate land may in any
circumstances whatsoever be permanently alienated, not even to the Gambia Government. All revenues derived from lands in the Protectorate form part of the revenue of the Native Authorities concerned; all leases held from the Crown at the time of the coming into operation of the ordinance were automatically transferred to the appropriate Native Authorities as lessors.

**ADMINISTRATION**

(a) Colony

Certain portions of Colony land are administered under the Protectorate Ordinance, the only portion with a separate Colony administration being the island of St. Mary, on which Bathurst is situated, and Kombo St. Mary, the adjoining district on the mainland. The town of Bathurst is administered by a town council and the district of Kombo St. Mary by the Kombo Rural Authority. The Commissioner of the Colony is chairman of both bodies. The Town Council, which has a revenue of some £14,000 a year, consists of four nominated members, other than the Chairman, and 15 members elected on a wide franchise. Members of the Rural Authority are at present all nominated and number 24, of whom three are Government officers, in addition to the Chairman.

(b) Protectorate

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the protectorate by the Anglo-French Commission in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the Protectorate into closer relationship with the Government of the Gambia.

The Protectorate Ordinance, 1935, empowers the Governor to divide the Protectorate into administrative Divisions, Districts and Sub-Districts, and to alter or vary the boundaries of such areas and to approve the appointment of a head chief, deputy head chief or sub-chief and to remove or suspend them from office. A head chief or sub-chief may appoint or remove headmen. There are at present four Divisions each in charge of a Commissioner. These are Western (area, 1,093 square miles, 12 Districts with a population of 67,739); Central (area, 1,122 square miles, 11 Districts with a population of 69,418); MacCarthy Island (area, 959 square miles; eight Districts with population of 54,266); Upper River (area 790 square miles; four Districts with population of 55,463). In addition to a total population estimated at 246,886, approximately 11,000 farmers from the adjoining French territory immigrate for the ground-nut farming season.

The Native Authority Ordinance, 1933, provides for the appointment of a chief or native council or group of natives as a Native Authority now called District Authority. The membership of the 36 District Authorities consists in all cases of district heads as presidents, together with their village heads and advisers in council. Since 1944 there has been an annual conference of the Protectorate chiefs which may be the forerunner of an eventual Protectorate Council. At these conferences matters relating to the Protectorate are explained to the chiefs and there is free discussion of any topic of interest.

The Protectorate Treasuries Ordinance, 1945, permits the formation of group or district treasuries managed by finance committees appointed by the District Authorities. The total revenue from 35 Districts in 1949-50 was £52,697.

The Senior Commissioner exercises a general supervision of the work of the Commissioners and performs the functions exercised elsewhere by a Secretary of Native Affairs.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

There is an Education Department under the Senior Education Officer who has the assistance of a Woman Education Officer and an Education Officer for the Protectorate.

Government is now responsible for primary education in Bathurst, though the schools have a religious grouping and are administered through Management Committees on each of which the appropriate religious authority is represented. These Government schools are grouped as follows:

One each—Anglican/Methodist Boys’ Primary, Girls’ Primary and Infant School.
One each—Roman Catholic Boys’ Primary, Girls’ Primary and Infant School.
One each—Mohammedan Boys’ Primary and Infant School.

At the end of 1949 three School Masters from the United Kingdom were appointed to act as “Advisers” for Primary Boys’ Schools and Technical education. They were posted to individual schools to improve standards and help the staff with refresher courses.

Education in the Primary Schools goes up to Standard VII and these eight Primary and Infant Schools have a total of 2,177 children on the registers. In connection with them Government maintains a Domestic Science Centre for girls, and also an Arts and Crafts Centre which is attended by boys in Standards V, VI and VII.

At Bakau a Government School was opened in September, 1947—and in September 1949 another Government School was opened at Serekunda bringing the total roll of these two Kombo Schools to 258 children. There are four secondary Mission Schools in Bathurst—a Methodist Boys’ High School and a Methodist Girls’ High School and one Roman Catholic Secondary School for boys and one for girls. The total number of secondary school pupils on the rolls of these schools, which are controlled by the Missions concerned but receive substantial grants from Government, is 184 boys and 175 girls. The Methodist Girls’ High School runs private kindergarten and preparatory classes attended by 148 children. The curriculum goes as far as School Certificate in the secondary schools.

A School of Science, serving all four secondary schools, was opened in January, 1947, and is filling a long-felt need in secondary school education in Bathurst. It is run by a Board of Management on which the Anglican, Methodist and Roman Catholic Missions and Government have equal representation. Government is responsible for recurrent expenditure on staff up to a fixed limit, other expenses being met by the missions.

Government also maintains in Bathurst classes for adult illiterates, with an average roll of 30. For children who are over-age for admission to primary schools there are classes attended by 164 boys and 18 girls, who occupy separate buildings.

In the Protectorate there is a Government boarding school at Georgetown, which gives primary education up to standard VII. Twelve village schools have been opened by Native
Authorities, one at Kaur in the Central Division, one at Brikama and one at Sukuta in the Western Division, one at Bansang, one at Karantaba and one at Kuntaur in the MacCarthy Island Division, one each at Kinti, Kunda, Ilias, Kiaf, Bureng, Dumbutu, and Njau in the Central Division. The schools have been developed in areas as evenly spread over the country as local circumstances permit except in the Upper River Division where peculiar problems exist.

The Roman Catholic Mission runs an elementary school at Fula Bantang in the MacCarthy Island Division and another at Basse in Upper River Division. Both schools have a curriculum with a practical bias adapted to Protectorate life and occupations. The Anglican Mission has a "station" at Kristi Kunda in the extreme east of the Protectorate, which runs one primary school. Several of these mission schools are in receipt of Government grants.

There is no post-secondary education in the Gambia. In the past teachers have been sent either to Sierra Leone or Gold Coast under Government Scholarships. In March 1949 a Teacher Training Centre was opened at Georgetown under the supervision of the Protectorate Education Officer. Other students go to West Africa or to the United Kingdom for higher education, either in a private capacity or under Government scholarships.

**Health**

Medical facilities in the Gambia are based on two general hospitals, one at Bathurst and one at Bansang. Supplementing these are health centres at Basse, Georgetown, Kuntaur, Brikama and Bakau; a mobile unit which undertakes a regular weekly circuit in part of the Western Division, and 31 dispensaries and sub-dispensaries situated throughout the Protectorate. Maternity and infant welfare work remains chiefly centred in Bathurst, but ante-natal and infant welfare clinics are in operation at Bakau, Sukuta and Brikama in Kombo North and Western divisions, at Basse and to a lesser extent at Georgetown in conjunction with Bansang hospital. All such centres are now supervised by a Welfare Sister, those at Basse and Georgetown being visited by the Medical Officer from Bansang.

The headquarters of the Health Service is in Bathurst with African Inspectors posted to important points throughout the country. A Travelling Sanitary Superintendent supervises the work of Sanitary Inspectors in the Protectorate.

The staffs of both services have been considerably augmented and are now in training as part of the major development schemes projected.

**Labour**

The Labour Department was created in 1939. A Labour Advisory Board was established in 1945 but did not function until 1947. The Board has equal representatives of employers and employees.

Joint machinery has been established among Government employees. Existing legislation has been amended to provide for the appointment of a wages council. There has been a general improvement in the running of trade unions with a tendency towards unification. The Labour Department has a voluntary registration scheme for craftsmen and other skilled and semi-skilled people and both employers and employees use the department when requiring labour or seeking employment. A technical school was started in 1949 to train youths in carpentry, joinery and masonry.

**Communications**

Ocean services between the United Kingdom and the Gambia are maintained by Messrs. Elder Dempster Lines, Ltd., and the United Africa Company, Ltd.

The West African Airways Corporation and Air France (the latter during the dry season) provide services which connect northwards at Dakar with the trunk routes between the United Kingdom, Europe and South America; and southwards with Sierra Leone and Gold Coast with connections to Nigeria and South Africa.

The airfield is at Yundum, distant 17 miles from Bathurst.

Bathurst has a first-class flying-boat base which was used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation transatlantic Boeing services but which is not now in regular use.

Internal communication is chiefly by river. The Gambia River is navigable for ocean-going ships for 180 miles and by river vessels for 300 miles. The Government operates a service of river vessels which normally run weekly during the trading season and fortnightly at other times of the year.

Cable and Wireless, Ltd., operates a station at Bathurst. Communication with the rest of the world and a Radio Telephone Service with the United Kingdom, most countries of Europe and British West Africa are maintained.

Bathurst wireless station, which has a range of approximately 1,000 miles, communicates with ships at sea and the important town of Dakar in the French Senegal. Wireless stations are established at Kuntaur, Georgetown, Mansa-Konko and Basse, and a regular service is maintained between these inland towns and Bathurst.

On the river steamer "Lady Wright" there is transmitting and receiving apparatus for communication with Bathurst and Protectorate wireless stations.

A central battery telephone system is employed in the town of Bathurst with lines to Cape St. Mary, Fajara, Yundum and Brikama. A telephone line between Kuntaur, Georgetown and Bansang is in operation.

There are no railways. A tarred road connects Bathurst with Cape St. Mary and Fajara on the coast about 10 miles distant, crossing Oyster Creek at Denton Bridge. At Mile Six a tarred road leads by Kanifing to Brikama, 16½ miles, other roads go from Kanifing to Sukuta, 3½ miles, and from Kanifing to Fajara. For the most part the remainder of the road system consists of secondary roads on each bank of the river to Basse with feeder roads to various wharf towns on the river. These secondary roads are usable only with difficulty during the rain season; a gravelled road is maintained from Barra on North Bank opposite Bathurst to French frontier post at Karrang and thence to Dakar. A new Trans-Gambia road has been opened from the French frontier north of Farrafeni to Ballingho and on the south bank and from the new wharf at Yellitenda to French frontier at Messera. Powered car ferries are in operation at Bathurst–Barra, Ballingho–Yellitenda and Kerewan.

Motor cars are used in Bathurst and its vicinity throughout the year and in the Protectorate.

There is no direct parcel post scheme at present with foreign countries. All parcels are forwarded through the medium of the General Post Office, London, a small additional charge being made for onward transmission.
