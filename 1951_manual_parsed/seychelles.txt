SEYCHELLES
Situation and Area
The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. latitude 4° and 10°. The total area of the colony and its dependencies is 156 square miles. The number of islands under the Seychelles Government is 92. Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to contain 55 square miles. It has about 105 miles of good roads and paths, and communication between all the districts of the island is easy. It is distant from Mauritius 934, from Madagascar 600, and from Zanzibar 970 miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse (900 acres); Félicité (689 acres); North Island (525 acres); St. Anne (500 acres); Providence (500 acres); Frigate (700 acres); Denis (340 acres); Cerf (290 acres); and Bird or Sea Cow Island (160 acres).

The following islands are also dependencies of Seychelles:—The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijouter Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island.

The island of Coëtivy, formerly a dependency of Mauritius, was transferred to Seychelles by Letters Patent in 1907, and Farquhar Island in 1922. There are lighthouses on Denis Island and Manuiles Island (nine miles north-east of Mahé in longitude 55° 32' 20" E., and latitude 4° 29' S.) and in Victoria Harbour. The light on the Capucine Point has been transferred to the Police Point.

CLIMATE
Mahé is healthy and entirely free from malaria. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 84, and falls frequently at night to 72. Records taken on the hills are several degrees lower. The rainfall at Victoria was, in 1949, 70.43 inches. The average over the past 49 (1900–1949) years is 90.57 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Mahé rises abruptly from the sea, and the highest peak reaches the elevation of 2,993 feet. Victoria, the capital of the island is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a safe and commodious harbour, provided with a lighthouse showing a white flash of 0.7 second duration every 6.7 seconds.

POPULATION
Census 1901, 19,237; census 1911, 22,691; census 1921, 24,523; census 1931, 27,444; census 1947, 34,632.

The death rate in 1949 was 11.94 per 1,000; the birth rate in 1949 being 29.01 per 1,000.

RELIGION
The population is principally Roman Catholic, but there is also a considerable Anglican congregation and a small Seventh Day Adventist Mission. Heads of Churches are the Bishop of Victoria (Roman Catholic) and the Archdeacon of Seychelles (Anglican).

HISTORY
The islands are believed to have been discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro Mascareñas, in 1505, but the discovery was not apparently followed by any attempt at colonisation.

Previous to the French occupation they were the resort of pirates or corsairs who infested the Indian Ocean, some of whose names are borne by descendants in Mahé at the present time.

Under the government at Mauritius of Labourdonnais, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1743, and M. Picault,
who took possession of the islands in the name of the King of France, called the principal island Mahé. In 1756 the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Moreau de Sécheres, who was Controller-General of Finance under Louis XV, from 1754 to 1756.

The natural resources of the islands and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and other inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and respite, but on 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcome, of His Majesty's ship "Orpheus."

The last French Governor, M. De Quincy, who was born at Paris in November, 1748, became, after Lieutenant Sullivan, R.N., who had been placed in charge, had left, the first Agent Civil under the British Government. M. De Quincy's reign as French Governor lasted 20 years. He remained for 18 years in the service of the British Government, and died on 10th July, 1827.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Captain Ferrier of His Majesty's ship "Albion," but it was not until the capture of Mauritius in 1810, that Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that colony.

CONSTITUTION

From 1794 to 1810 Seychelles, though nominally a British colony, seems to have been administered as a French colony, and all Civil Status Acts ran in the name of the French Government. A Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed in 1872, when the finances of the Seychelles were separated from those of Mauritius. The title of the head of the Government was then changed from that of Civil Commissioner to that of Chief Civil Commissioner. The powers of the board were further enlarged in 1874 by another Order-in-Council.

The increasing importance of these islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in the constitution of the Government, and in December, 1888, an Order-in-Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council. In 1897, by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, the Administrator was given full powers as Governor, and Seychelles was practically separated from Mauritius. The separation was completely carried out by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, by which Seychelles was erected into a separate colony under its own Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

By the Legislative Council Order in Council of March, 1948, the elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time. The new Legislative Council, which held its first meeting in November, 1948, consists of the Governor as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. Any British subject of 21 years and upwards, who has been ordinarily resident in the Colony for 12 months, is entitled to be registered as a voter provided (a) he is literate, and (b) he pays either income or property tax.

ADMINISTRATION

The administrative functions of Government are carried out by the departments of Agriculture, Education, Health, Police, Port, Post, Public Works and Treasury, under the general direction of the Governor through the Secretary to Government who is the senior administrative officer.

The judiciary is composed of the Chief Justice, a Police Magistrate, and one part-time Justice of the Peace. The Attorney-General is also Crown Prosecutor and the Assistant Attorney-General also supervises the Registry of Deeds.

Local boards have been appointed for North Mahé, South Mahé and La Digue. A District Council was elected in January, 1949, on the principle of adult suffrage under Local Government Ordinance No. 23 of 1948 to carry on local government in Praslin, and a further such Council was elected for the capital at Victoria in March, 1950.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education is under the control of a Director who is advised on education policy by an Advisory Council. As a result of a recent reorganisation of the education system all previous legislation has been repealed and replaced by Ordinance No. 15 of 1944. All schools are now inspected by officers of the Education Department, schools and teachers are registered and the salaries of teachers in aided schools are paid from public funds.

There are two Government primary schools and six Church of England and twenty Roman Catholic aided primary schools, as well as a few small private schools. Secondary education is provided at Seychelles College, a government school for boys, and for girls at St. Joseph's Convent which receives a grant from public funds. The Cambridge School Certificate examination is taken in form V in both schools. Preparatory departments are attached to both these schools. A Government Modern School has been opened in temporary buildings formerly occupied by Seychelles College, which has now transferred to new buildings, and a Government Modern School has also been built at Grand 'Anse, Praslin. The enrolment in all schools in December, 1949, was 2,184 boys and 2,328 girls. Housecraft and technical centres have recently been opened. Bursaries are awarded at secondary schools for intending teachers and frequent refresher courses for teachers are held. Continuation classes are also provided.

Government expenditure on education in 1949 was Rs. 261,601 from local funds and Rs. 232,848 from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund.
Information Services

The Secretary to Government is responsible for the "Government Bulletin", which is issued daily and contains local announcements, and Reuters news. Broadcasting, visual information and the issue of printed information material are under the control of the Director of Education. Open air cinema shows to audiences averaging 2,000 persons are given in Victoria on two or three nights a month, and much use is made of visual aids in training teachers and in schools. Cinema shows are also provided in country districts by means of a mobile information unit. Programmes of talks, news and music are broadcast on Sundays and Wednesdays from ZCQ, on a frequency of 6,145 Kc/s and wavelength of 48·8 metres.

Health

Medical and health services are under the control of a Senior Medical Officer assisted by six Medical Officers, a Senior Nursing Sister, a Senior Health Inspector, and nursing and sanitary staff.

There are hospitals at Port Victoria and Baie St. Anne, Praslin. Dispensaries with rest beds are situated at La Digue and Anse Royale. There is an out-patient dispensary at Grand 'Anse, Praslin and a weekly clinic is held at Grand 'Anse, Mahé, Takamaka and Belombre. There is a leprosy hospital at Curieuse Island, a quarantine station at Long Island and a home for the aged in Victoria.

Expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1949 was Rs. 392,123·22.

Labour and Welfare

During the year 1949 a sum of Rs. 33,735 was spent on outdoor relief for 923 persons. The average population of the Fiennes Institute was 67 for the year maintained at the cost of Rs. 10,606 excluding salaries. The average population of St. Elizabeths Institute was 50 children under 9 years of age. This is run and administered by the Roman Catholic Mission.

A Labour and Welfare officer seconded from Mauritius took up his appointment on 15th December, 1949. A revision of the poor relief records was undertaken.

Communications

Roads

There are 118 miles of earth roads to a general minimum of 16 feet in width on the island, of which 88 miles are suitable for motor vehicles. The tar-macadamising of town roads is in hand.

Railways

There is no railway in the Colony.

Shipping

British India Steam Navigation Company passenger vessels on the Bombay-Mombasa service call at Port Victoria on the average once monthly in each direction.

Air

The Air Service provided by the Royal Air Force with flying boats between Seychelles and East Africa, Ceylon and Mauritius came to an end with the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force during 1946.

Posts and Telegraphs

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. Direct cables to Aden and Colombo were completed in 1922. Cable communication with every part of the world is now provided by Cable and Wireless, Ltd.

Cable and Wireless, Ltd., also maintains a coast station at Victoria for communication with ships at sea.

Poor communications handicap postal services. Air mails come from abroad as far as Mombasa and Bombay and there have to await a ship.

The Colony's Public Debt consists of a loan of Rs. 390,215 from the Imperial Government to finance the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. The loan is repayable in 30 years from 1938 by a sinking fund at Rs. 9,782 payable half yearly.

The main sources of revenue in the colony are taxation, including import and export duties, crown lands and investments. The import duties are specific and ad valorem, preferential rates being granted in respect of Empire imports. The duty on all primary foods is specific:—rice and flour 2 cents per kilo, beans 1½ cents, maize and bran 1 cent, sugar 3 cents, coffee 5 cents and tea 60 cents per kilo. On other foodstuffs ad valorem duties are charged. The ad valorem rates are 33½ per cent. and 17 per cent.—general and preferential. Free admissions are allowed in the case of condensed milk, cement, gunny bags, paints, enamels and tools of trade.

The main export duties at present are a tax of 23½ per cent. of the f.o.b. value on copra, coconut oil and coconuts; of 17½ per cent. of the f.o.b. value on essential oils; and of 10 per cent. of the f.o.b. value on vanilla. There is also an export duty of Rs. 1 on guano if the total percentage of phosphoric anhydride is more than 27·484, and 75 cts. where the percentage is below that figure. In addition, a cess of 6 per cent. of the f.o.b. value of all coconut products exported is paid into the Price Stabilisation Fund for the coconut industry.

Income Tax

Income Tax is chargeable on all net income remaining after the following deductions:—

- Earned Income relief . . ⅓ of earned income (Maximum Rs. 1,500).
- Resident's allowance . . Rs. 400.
- Wife's allowance . . Rs. 800.
- Child allowance . . Rs. 250 per child, (Maximum Rs. 1,250).
- Life insurance . . Amount premiums (Maximum ¼th of total income).
- Dependent relative . . Rs. 400.
The rates of tax are on a sliding scale, commencing at 2 per cent. on the first Rs. 1,000 of chargeable income and increasing by 1 per cent. for each 1,000 to Rs. 4,000. Between Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 5,000 the rate is 5 per cent., increasing by 2½ per cent. for each Rs. 1,000 up to 40 per cent. at Rs. 17,000. Over Rs. 17,000 the rate is 40 per cent.

**Currency and Banking**

A Government Savings Bank was established in March, 1897, and at the close of the year 1949, the amount standing to the credit of depositors was Rs. 3,070,617. Seventy-five per cent. of the Savings Bank funds are invested. There are no private banks.

The legal tender currency is Seychelles notes and coins. Accounts are kept in rupees and cents. The Rupee is worth 1s. 6d.

**Production and Trade**

The chief exports in 1948 and 1949 were as follows:

|                | 1948     | 1949     |

In Victoria there is a botanic garden containing many interesting tropical plants.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated coco-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelles administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are, however, to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands.

The percentage of trade in 1938, 1945, 1946, 1947 and 1948 was as follows:
