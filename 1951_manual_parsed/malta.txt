MALTA

SITUATION AND AREA

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa.

Malta is about 17 miles in length and 9 miles in breadth with an area of 94·870 square miles. Gozo has an area of 25·899 square miles and Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are mere islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.
CLIMATE

The climate of Malta is very healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The climatic conditions are much influenced by the friable nature and sponginess of the layers of rock. The temperature depends on the dominant westerlies. The lowest temperature in 1949, 39·4° F., was registered on 4th March, and the highest, 91·9° F., on the 10th July. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in sub-tropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the Scirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is between 56° and 59° F., and the mean minimum 51·2° F.; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, September) the mean maximum is between 83° and 86° F. and the mean minimum 71·2° F. The mean annual temperature is 66° F. and the mean annual rainfall is 17 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous calcareous stone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The chief town and capital of Malta is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian’s, a population which in 1948, when a census was last taken, was 57,156. The “Three Cities” (Senglea, Cospicua and Vittoriosa) have a population of 11,394. Mdina, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, has a population of 13,887. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), with a population of about 6,175.

The Maltese language is the language of general intercourse in the islands. It is of Semitic origin, and is akin to Arabic. The educated and commercial classes also speak English, and some Italian. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, and industrious and are excellent seamen and mechanics. Large numbers of them are to be found in Algeria, the Regency of Tunis, Egypt, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, early potatoes, onions, cumin seed and oranges are exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in H.M. Dockyard; others are employed in connection with the trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepôt and port of call. It is a port of registry, having in December, 1949, 65 vessels of 18,933 gross tonnage.

RELIGION

The Roman Catholic religion is by law the religion of the country, but full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship are guaranteed, and persons of any faith may hold any office.

HISTORY

No traces of Paleolithic cultures have so far been discovered in the Maltese archipelago, and the prospects are not very encouraging.

The Pleistocene period is richly represented by the remains of extinct fauna embedded in the floor deposit of Ghar Dalam (the Cave of Darkness) and also by the fossils recovered from many other ossiferous caves and rock fissures.

The Maltese islands were first inhabited by a neolithic race, not later than 3,000 B.C. The chief monuments belonging to this period consist of various megalithic temples (Tarxien, Mnaidra, Hagar Qim and Gantija), a subterranean sanctuary (Hal Saflieni Hypogeum), menhirs, dolmens and other megalithic remains.

A unique collection of neolithic material recovered from the different sites is preserved in the Valletta Museum.

A culture belonging to the early metal ages is also richly represented.

The Phoenicians probably took possession of Malta as soon as they made themselves masters of the Mediterranean Sea. Phoenician remains are few but there are numerous rockcut graves of Phoenician type.

At the beginning of the Punic wars the islands were held by Carthage. In the course of the first Punic war they changed hands more than once, but at its conclusion they were still in the possession of the Carthaginians. In 218 B.C. they passed finally to Rome. Under the Romans Malta appears to have enjoyed great prosperity. Diodorus Siculus speaks of the excellence of its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, and its many skilful artificers, and refers to its fertility, and Cicero, in the Verrine orations, speaks of it as abounding in riches and famous for its textile manufactures. Inscriptions show that it enjoyed municipal rights in the time of Hadrian, and an interesting fact in its recorded history is that it was the scene of St. Paul’s shipwreck (Acts xxviii). On the final division of the Empire in 395 A.D., Malta fell to the share of the Byzantine Emperor, and for the next four centuries its history is almost a blank. In the 9th century it was three times invaded by the Arabs, who finally conquered it in 870, the Byzantine garrison being massacred in an insurrection of the inhabitants.

In 1090, Count Roger the Norman, with a handful of men, subjected the islands to Sicily. The Sicilian domination lasted for four hundred years, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and Castilian ruling in turn. During this time, Malta had Sicilian governors and laws, but there is no record of any extensive Sicilian immigration, and the persistence of the old Semitic names in the parish registers, instituted at this period, stands as further evidence that no great ethnographic changes occurred.

The connection with Sicily was broken in 1530, when the Emperor Charles V gave Malta to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who had been driven from Rhodes by the Turks, and who held Malta until 1798. The loyalty of the Maltese to their new sovereigns, who for the first time were resident in the island, was put to a severe test on
several occasions, the most notable being the great siege of 1565, when the Order of St. John, under Grand Master Jean de la Valette, resisted the attacks of the land and sea forces of Solymy the Magnificent. It was after this great feat of arms that the city of Valletta was built, strong enough to defy the Turkish attacks threatened yearly by the Sultan.

Napoleon Bonaparte invested the island on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda, and, on 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed.

The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. On 15th April, 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the war.

**CONSTITUTION**

A Council of Government, partly elected, was constituted by Letters Patent in 1849, and reconstituted in 1887, the Letters Patent being amended in 1898 and again in 1903.

By Letters Patent dated 14th April, 1921, responsible government was established in Malta.

This constitution was suspended from 1930 to 1932 and again on 2nd November, 1933, the Senate and Legislative Assembly being dissolved from the same date. It was finally revoked by the Letters Patent, dated 12th August, 1936, which were proclaimed in Malta on 2nd September, 1936.

Letters Patent dated 14th February, 1939, re-established representative Government, providing for a partly-elected Council of Government and for an Executive Council.

New Letters Patent, dated 5th September, 1947, came into force on the 22nd September, 1947. They provide for a Legislative Assembly of forty members, elected by universal suffrage by proportional representation. The Legislative Assembly passes Bills for "the peace, order and good government of Malta," subject to certain limitations regarding "reserved matters." The Ministry consists of the Prime Minister and not more than seven other Ministers. The Executive Council consists of the Cabinet presided over by the Governor. Legislative and administrative powers in regard to defence and various matters related or incidental to defence and external relations are reserved to the Governor advised by the Nominated Council, which consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legal Secretary and three officers (one from each of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force). The Privy Council consists of the Executive Council and the Nominated Council sitting together.

The Privy Council affords an opportunity for joint consultation in matters in which action proposed to be taken by one side of the dyarchy may affect the other side.

The English language and the Maltese language are the official languages of Malta.

**ADMINISTRATION**

Appointments to public offices in Malta are made by the Governor, subject to the provisions of the new constitution embodied in the 1947 Letters Patent, and of the colonial regulations.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Elementary education is carried on principally in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are six secondary schools (one of them preparatory) with 2,393 scholars, 114 primary schools with an average enrolment of 38,677 pupils. There is a university (founded in 1769) with an average attendance of about 300 students. The fees are comparatively low, ranging from 106s. 6d. to 160s. per annum in the Lyceum and £10 per annum, exclusive of laboratory and other fees, for all lectures in the university. There are 25 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects, with an attendance of 611, and 162 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates, with an attendance of 2,428. There are two technical schools and one tailoring school with an attendance of 357 students, 23 evening classes for handicraft and engineering with an attendance of 396 pupils, and 36 trade classes for emigrants with an attendance of 509 pupils. There are numerous private, elementary and secondary schools. The total number of these schools is about 63, with an attendance of 12,079 pupils. Compulsory education was introduced in the autumn of 1946. English and Maltese are the only languages of instruction in the primary schools.

**Public Works**

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works were commenced in 1899, and Cottonera, Siema, St. Julians, Msida, Pietà, Kalkara, Zabbar, Hamrun, Qormi, Balzan, Birkri, Mdina, Rabat, Tarxien, Pawla, Zejtun and Attard have been drained. The sewerage of streets in Lija, Luqa and Ghaxaq is almost completed. The sewerage of the streets in Zebbug and Mosta is in progress. The deviation of the main sewer at Kalkara has been taken in hand. New mains have been laid in Albert Town and at Għajn Dwieli Road, Pawla. Small extensions are also being continually made in new streets.

4·85 miles have been so far surfaced with sheet asphalt and 236·96 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing.

Since 1937 a scheme for the collection and disposal of domestic refuse has been in operation in Valletta, Floriana, Gżira, Msida, Ta' Xbiex, Siema and St. Julian's. In August, 1939, the service was extended to the military areas at St. George's, St. Andrew's and Tigne'. It was later extended to Albert Town and a part of Hamrun.
In 1947 Government approved the reconditioning and extension of this service to the entire island by the employment of a fleet of 16 modern refuse collection vans and two additional pulverisers for refuse disposal and other necessary additional plant. So far the collection and disposal of domestic refuse is being performed by a fleet of 13 modern refuse collection vans. The four new refuse vans which had been ordered in 1948 were duly delivered by the end of last year. However, these cannot be set in operation and the service extended to the entire Island before the receipt of the two additional pulverisers and other necessary plant for which an order was placed in 1949. Delivery is expected by the end of the current year.

The cleansing service came under the control of the Ministry of Health on the 8th August, 1948. Since then the following districts have been added in the collection service:—B’kara, Balzan, Attard, Lija, Mosta, Naxxar, Pawla, Tarxien, Zabbar, Zejtun, Hamrun, Xgħira, Marsaxlokk, Rabar, Urdina and Qormi.

When war broke out a population of about 68,000 was being served. Now the population served is about 210,000. With the approved extended scheme estimated to be fully developed in two years time a population of about 260,000 will be served.

The piped water supply is now extended to all the villages in Malta and Gozo. A new pumping station capable of an output of 1½ million gallons daily has been erected at Ta’ Qali, limits of Attard, and works to augment the supply and to improve the distributory system are in progress.

Electric current for lighting and power has been extended to all the towns in Malta and to all the villages with the exception of a few which however will shortly be included in the distributory system. The necessary works have already been started and are nearing completion. In Gozo current is available to the public in the chief town, Victoria, which has its own generating station, and in the important villages of Xewkija, Għajnsielam, Nadur and Mgarr.

**Communications**

Motor bus services run between all the towns and villages. The telephone service is under Government control with exchanges at Floriana, Sienna, Rabat, St. Paul’s Bay and Gozo. The head office is at Merchants Street, Valletta. The number of exchange lines totals 4,226, with 6,361 stations. Malta is an important station of Cable & Wireless, Ltd., whose direct cables connect with Alexandria (5), Gibraltar (5), Bona (2), Tripoli, Sicily and Zante. Through these cables telegraphic communication is maintained through the company’s system with all parts of the world.

The company also operates a coast station for communication with ships at sea.

Malta is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is an important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling at any hour, day and night. There are air services from Malta to the United Kingdom, Italy and North African Territories. Owing to lack of accommodation, due to war damage, all civilians wishing to enter Malta, except for British and American tourists or holders of British passports on short visits for business purposes, must obtain an entry permit from the Lieutenant Governor’s office.

There is a direct mail communication with several Mediterranean ports and with England.

**Finance**

The revenue from all sources is paid into a consolidated fund, out of which the public service is supplied.

**Public Debt**

There is, strictly speaking, no public debt in Malta, but interest at 2½ per cent. is paid by the Government on £79,081, outstanding balance on 31st March, 1938, of the debt known as “Massa Frumentaria,” incurred by the Municipality of Valletta under the Government of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, in connection with the monopoly of the trade of wheat. The funds of the “Massa Frumentaria” were, in 1798, appropriated by the French Government, then in occupation of the island.

**Revenue**

The most important sources of revenue are the customs duties, licences, stamp duties, succession and donation duties, income tax, fees of office and reimbursements, post office, water and electricity receipts, and land revenue, interest, and profits from lotteries.

**Banking and Currency**

By Proclamation No. IV of 12th April, 1949, issued under Ordinance I of 1949 (the Currency Notes Ordinance) Bank of England notes have ceased to be legal tender in the Island as from 21st September, 1949. As from that date only
notes issued by the Commissioners of Currency under the above quoted Ordinance are legal tender. In addition British coins, including silver, cupronickel and bronze coins, are legal tender concurrently with local notes in denominations of 5s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and 1s.

All notes locally issued are covered by an equal amount of sterling deposited in a Note Security Fund with the Crown Agents for the Colonies. The amount of local currency in circulation on 31st March, 1950, was £14,927,361.

There are four banks carrying business in Malta:

(1) Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) which has four branches;
(2) The National Bank of Malta with two branches;
(3) Sciclunas Bank, originally a private bank, now amalgamated with the National Bank of Malta but still transacting business under the old name;
(4) B. Tagliaferro & Sons, a private bank.

In addition there is a Government Savings Bank established in 1833.

On 31st March, 1950, deposits in the Government Savings Bank amounted to £16,812,173 with 54,058 depositors.

TRADE

Customs Tariff

Until 1917 only specific duties were levied, the main headings being grain, wine, beer, spirits, cattle, petroleum, sugar and tobacco.

In January, 1917, ad valorem duties were introduced. These rates now vary from 3 per cent. to 75 per cent., and embrace all commodities not affected by specific duties, and not included in a list of exempted articles which—

(a) Under food and drink shows butter, cheese, coffee, milk (fresh or preserved), eggs in the shell, tea and cocoa, and certain other articles.

(b) Under raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured shows coal, coke, patent fuel and fuel oil, sponges, vegetables and flower seeds and certain other articles.

(c) Under manufactured articles, includes agricultural machines, books, cinema films, wrapping and printing paper, laundry soap of British Empire origin, yarns for lace-making, if of silk (excluding artificial) and linen, twines, certain materials used for cap-making, shoemaking, and bag-making, and certain articles used for divine worship.

(d) Under miscellaneous and unclassified articles, includes articles imported by Government departments—bullion and specie, pedigree animals, and engravings, drawings and paintings representing Maltese views and subjects of local interest.

In 1934 Empire preferential duties were adopted. These duties affect boots and shoes, spirits, leaf tobacco, wheat, flour, cement, laundry soap, arms and ammunition, articles of gold, silver and platinum and plated goods, confectionery and chocolate, furniture and cabinetware, motor vehicles, wireless sets, pianos and a number of articles falling under the designation of "goods unenumerated". Ad valorem goods enjoy a preference of 1 to 26 per cent. as against the corresponding General Tariff rates.

In the case of goods subject to a specific rate of duty the General Tariff shows an addition of 10 per cent. on the Empire Preferential Tariff on boots and shoes, 1s. per litre on spirits, 1s. per 100 kilogrammes on wheat, 2s. per 100 kilos on flour, 8s. 4d. per 100 kilogrammes on laundry soap and 4s. per 1,000 kilogrammes on cement.

The amount of duty collected in 1949 from specific duties was £1,310,778 and from ad valorem duties was £1,105,062.

The percentages of trade compared with the whole import and export trade of the Island (imports, domestic exports and re-exports), for the respective destinations are as follows:—

| Per cent. |
|-----------|
| United Kingdom | 43·95 |
| Other parts of the British Empire | 13·64 |
| Foreign countries | 42·40 |
