Hong Kong

Situation and Area

The Colony of Hong Kong is situated at the mouth of the Canton River about 40 miles east of Macao and 91 miles south of Canton between 22° 9' and 22° 35' N. latitude and 113° 50' and 114° 30' E. longitude. The island of Hong Kong on which is situated the capital city of Victoria is about 11 miles long and of a breadth varying from two to five miles, its area being about 32 square miles. Opposite to the island is the peninsula of Kowloon (3½ square miles) which was ceded to Great Britain in 1860. A number of smaller islands including Stonecutters Island (¼ square mile), Green Island and Aplichau, are also included in the ceded territory of the Colony of Hong Kong. The other component of the Colony is the New Territories which were leased for a period of 99 years from the Chinese Government by an agreement concluded in 1898. The total area of the New Territories, which includes a large number of islands as well as a portion of the
mainland lying to the north of Kowloon, is about 359 square miles, making the total area of the colony 391 square miles.

**CLIMATE**

The climate of Hong Kong is sub-tropical, and is governed to a large extent by the monsoons, the winter being normally cool and dry, and the summer hot and humid. The range of temperatures is very considerable, falling from a monthly average of 82° in July to 59° in February, the average for the year being 72°. The temperature very rarely rises above 95° or falls below 40°. The humidity in spring and summer is very high, at times reaching 95 per cent., while in early winter it may fall as low as 20 per cent. The mean annual rainfall is about 85 inches, of which about 67 inches normally falls between May and September. Sunshine varies from an average of 94 hours in the month of March to 217 hours during October.

The north-east monsoon sets in during October and lasts until April. The early winter is the most pleasant time of the year, the weather being generally sunny and the atmosphere often exceedingly dry. Later in the winter, cloud is more frequent though rainfall remains slight until May. The transition from winter to summer monsoon is fairly rapid. During this transitional period, fog and very low cloud are common. From May until September, winds are generally from a southerly quarter, humidity is high, and rainfall may be heavy. Typhoons may occur between July and October, although they are sometimes experienced before or after this period. There is little difference between the climate of the island and that of the immediately adjacent mainland though generally the temperature on the island is slightly lower and the humidity slightly greater, but the northern part of the leased territory has a much lower rainfall.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

The waterways of the colony with an area of ten square miles form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world. The entrance from the east is by the Lyemun Strait (Lei Yu Mun) where less than half a mile separates the island from the mainland. The granite hills which surround it rise between two and three thousand feet high, the whole forming a panorama of singular beauty. At the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour the city of Victoria proper extends for nearly five miles, and a built-up area extends for over three miles east of the original city boundary. Most of the urban area is flat reclaimed land, but in some places streets and houses mount high up the hillside and there are many residences with small connecting roads high on the slopes of Victoria Peak (1,823 feet).

The Kowloon Peninsula, which was formerly covered by low hills but has been extensively levelled, has been extended in area by various reclamations and has developed rapidly as a residential suburb. It contains also the main industrial area of the colony, while on the western shore are the wharves for ocean-going ships, and the terminus of the Kowloon–Canton railway occupies the extreme southern tip of the peninsula. On the reclaimed area at the northern end of Kowloon Bay lies the Colony’s only aerodrome at Kai Tak.

Behind Kowloon lies the main part of the New Territories, by far the larger part of which consists of steep and barren hillsides. The highest point is the mountain of Tai Mo Shan which lies seven miles north-west of Kowloon and is 3,130 feet in height. The eastern side of the New Territories mainland is mountainous and extends to the rocky and deeply indented coastline of Mirs Bay. A few villages make a frugal living by farming its narrow valleys and fishing the innumerable inlets. In the north-western part of the New Territories lies the Colony’s main area of cultivable land stretching to the marshes on the eastern shore of Deep Bay. Also included in the New Territories are 75 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The largest of these is Lantao (Tai Yu Shan), an island more than twice the size of Hong Kong island itself, rugged and beautiful in appearance, and rising to twin peaks of over 3,000 feet.

**POPULATION**

No official census has been taken since 1931 when the total population was found to be 849,751. By 1941 the figure was estimated to have risen to over 1,600,000. During the Japanese occupation the population fell rapidly until by August, 1945, it was estimated to be less than 600,000. Since then there has been a great influx of people from South China, and while no accurate estimate can be made it is considered that the total population of the Colony in March, 1950, was about 2,317,000. This includes approximately 13,000 British subjects of European race.

**RELIGION**

There are in the Colony an Anglican Cathedral, a Roman Catholic Cathedral, and a considerable number of churches and chapels of Anglican, Roman Catholic and various other denominations, both for the European population and for those of the Chinese population who are Christians. There is also a Jewish community in the Colony, and, in rural areas, several Buddhist monasteries.

Most of the Chinese population observe their ancestral rites and festivals; there are a number of Buddhists and Taoists and a strong Christian minority. All the principal Indian communities are represented.

**HISTORY**

Until 1841 the island now known as Hong Kong was inhabited only by a few fishermen, stonecutters and farmers, and provided a notorious retreat for smugglers and pirates. In January of that year, it was occupied by British forces, partly as a reprisal for the treatment of British merchants in Canton and partly as a base from which trade with China could be conducted free from the excesses of arbitrary power. The cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in August, 1842. In 1860 the Convention of Peking added the Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island to the Crown Colony; and under a further Convention of Peking, signed in 1898, the New Territories, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, up to the high water line on their northern shores, were leased to Great Britain for a period of 99 years.

Almost a century of uninterrupted peaceful development followed the Treaty of Nanking. The fine natural harbour developed into one of the world’s great ports, and the freedom of the port ensured the role of entrepôt both for the trade and for the labour of China’s southern provinces. Reclamations were carried out, roads built, and anti-malarial measures initiated; shipyards capable of constructing 10,000-ton ships, docks to accommodate the world’s largest liners, and light industries all developed with the years.
In 1938, the fall of Canton to the Japanese invaders brought thousands of homeless refugees from South China. Hong Kong itself was attacked on 8th December, 1941, and fell on Christmas day after 18 days' fighting. The ensuing occupation by the Japanese lasted for over 3½ years, during which Europeans were interned, while many of those not interned also suffered great hardships.

For the first months after the restoration of British rule in August, 1945, the Colony was governed by a military administration, until in 1946 civil government was re-established.

The ensuing period of unsettlement in China which culminated in the downfall of the Nationalist Government and the establishment of the Central People's Government in Peking caused a steady influx of refugees of all nationalities into the Colony. In view of the serious over-crowding resulting from this, with its attendant dangers to the maintenance of public health, measures were introduced in 1950 to control the immigration of Chinese.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Government is administered, under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor advised by an Executive Council at present comprising in addition to the Governor six official and six unofficial members, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community; and by a Legislative Council presided over by the Governor, and comprising not more than nine official and eight unofficial members. Of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council six are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor, three being Chinese; one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils vacate their seats, after five and four years respectively, from date of appointment.

There is also an Urban Council in which are vested, *inter alia*, powers of making bye-laws in respect of certain matters relating to public health and sanitation.

The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Hong Kong Ordinances of which an edition, revised to 1931, was published in 1938. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901. The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases.

Proposals for a new constitution were approved by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in July, 1947. They envisaged the reduction of the number of official members of the Legislative Council from 9 to 7, the number of unofficial members remaining 8, so that an unofficial majority would be created; and the institution of a Municipal Council. This would consist of 30 members, two-thirds of them popularly elected and one-third nominated by representative bodies. The Chinese community would be represented by one-half of the members of the Council, and the non-Chinese also by one half. The Council's administrative area would comprise the whole of the Island of Hong Kong, the ceded Kowloon territory and that part of the New Territories known as New Kowloon. The Council would be responsible for the discharge of such functions as are delegated to it by the Legislature; the intention would be that these should represent a considerable enlargement of those performed by the existing Urban Council.

However, in August, 1949, the Governor remitted for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies certain fresh proposals embodied in a motion passed in the Legislative Council with the support of all the unofficial members and backed by such other indications of public opinion as were available. These proposals were based on the view that those already approved no longer represented the best means of widening the share of the population in the management of the Colony's affairs; they envisage instead a further widening of the basis of unofficial representation in the Legislative Council, to which development of a Municipal Council would be secondary.

**ADMINISTRATION**

Under the general direction of the Colonial Secretariat, the administrative functions of Government are discharged by some 30 Departments, all the officers of which are members of the Civil Service. There are five Legal sub-departments excluding the Judiciary. The Financial Secretary has, since 1938, assumed a purely administrative function in the Secretariat and under his direction, the Treasury is responsible for the public accounts. The assessment and collection of rates is the responsibility of the Commissioner, Rating and Valuation Department, while the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is concerned with the collection of miscellaneous indirect taxation and of the direct taxation levied under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, 1947. The Director of Commerce and Industry is charged with the collection of import and excise duties and with the direction of preventive work.

The Secretary for Chinese Affairs, who is a senior administrative officer, has a wide and general responsibility in all matters affecting the Chinese community. The Commissioner of Labour is responsible, *inter alia*, for ensuring that conditions in factories and workshops are in accordance with the requirements of existing legislation. He also provides a channel for the pursuit of negotiations between the parties involved in a trade dispute. The Social Welfare Officer operates under the general direction of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Public Health is the responsibility of the Medical Department and the Sanitary Department. The Public Works Department concerns itself with roads, buildings, waterworks, piers, government transport and similar matters.

The administration of the New Territories is in the charge of a District Commissioner assisted by a District Officer for each of the three districts.

The Head of the Sanitary Department is *ex officio* the Chairman of the Urban Council. The functions and authority of this council are more restricted than its title suggests and are subordinate in many respects to the executive authority of Government. The Council's power to originate subsidiary legislation in matters concerning public health and conservancy is subject to confirmation by the Legislative Council.

Other permanent Government departments are the Audit Department, the Education Department which controls the Government schools and supervises all private schools within the Colony, the Fire Brigade, Marine Department,
Civil Aviation Department, Police Department, Kowloon-Canton Railway, Post Office which controls Radio Hong Kong, the Prison Department, the Royal Observatory, the Public Relations Office and the Department of Statistics.

The departments dealing with agriculture, fisheries, forestry, markets and gardens are shortly to be combined under a Director of Agriculture and Fisheries.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education in Hong Kong is voluntary and is controlled by the terms of the Education Ordinance, 1913. Under this ordinance all schools, unless specially exempted, are required to register with the Director of Education and must comply with the regulations under the ordinance governing staff, buildings, number of pupils in classes and health.

In June 1950 there were 880 registered schools with a total enrolment of approximately 160,000, that is, 30,000 more than in June 1949.

The schools in the Colony may be classified as follows:

(a) Government schools, staffed and maintained by the Education Department.

(b) Grant schools, run mainly by missionary bodies with the assistance of a grant from Government to meet the difference between approved expenditure and income.

(c) Subsidized schools, those private schools in receipt of a subsidy from Government.

(d) Private schools which are not in need of or do not merit Government assistance.

(e) Military schools and certain others which are exempted from the provisions of the Education Ordinance.

The medium of instruction in schools varies from one category to another. In some, English is the sole language, in others Chinese, and a number of schools have classes in both languages. The Grant schools mainly use English, although one such school is entirely taught in Chinese. Teaching in subsidized and private schools is usually carried out in Chinese. Secondary education is to a great extent in the hands of government and grant-aided schools, while subsidized schools and private schools are largely concerned with, though not confined to, the field of primary education. In this field, however, Government is playing an increasingly large part, and plans are prepared for further extensions in the direction of semi-vocational Government primary schools.

Classes for adults in both technical and academic subjects are carried on under the aegis of the Government Evening Institute. The Government Technical College provides courses in wireless telegraphy, building and engineering and has started an experimental course for junior navigating officers. The Northcote Training College and the Rural Training College are maintained for those intending to take up teaching in urban and rural schools respectively. Election to both training colleges is by selection and students are provided with free tuition and receive the salary of uncertificated teachers during training.

The University of Hong Kong was incorporated in 1911 and opened in 1912. By 1941 there were in existence, in addition to classroom accommodation for 500 students, six hostels, laboratories, staff residences, a gymnasium, workshops and playing fields. As a result of the occupation of the Colony the University suffered considerable loss or damage to equipment and buildings. Towards the end of 1946 it was reopened and a total of 109 students were admitted to the faculties of medicine, engineering, arts and science. Since then, there has been considerable rehabilitation of buildings and equipment and the number of students at present attending courses is 629. In April, 1948, the University was formally reconstituted.

Health

The functions of the Medical Department are separated into three divisions: hospitals, health and investigation. The hospitals division, which includes out-patient departments and public dispensaries, cares for the sick and injured in eleven separate hospitals, fifteen dispensaries and three polyclinics. The hospitals provide approximately 1,750 beds for accidents, infectious diseases (including tuberculosis), mental and general diseases. Most of the hospital accommodation is on Hong Kong island and a smaller number of beds is available on the Kowloon Peninsula and in the New Territories.

The Tung Wah group of hospitals, which includes the Tung Wah, Tung Wah Eastern and Kwong Wah hospitals, and which are in receipt of a large subsidy from Government, provide approximately 1,100 beds. Financial assistance is also granted by Government to the Nethersole Hospital, which has approximately 140 beds, and the Hong Kong Anti-Tuberculosis Association's Ruttonjee Sanatorium, which has approximately 120 beds.

The health division has a variety of functions, including the control of anti-epidemic measures such as vaccination, inoculation, disinfection, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, the neonatal care of infants, and the inspection and treatment of school children. This division is also responsible for malaria control, port health work, including the airport and railway terminus, food and drug control, public health propaganda, the treatment and prevention of social diseases and the registration of births and deaths. The supervision of the cleanliness of houses, streets, open spaces and markets outside the urban area is also the responsibility of this division.

The investigation division is subdivided into pathological laboratories (one on each side of the harbour), a chemical laboratory, a biochemical laboratory, and public mortuaries where autopsies are carried out on all bodies of persons where the cause of death is in doubt.

On 30th June, 1950, the staff of the Medical Department consisted of:

Doctors, 133, of whom 106 were Chinese.
Nurses and Hospital Dressers, 537, of whom 428 were Chinese.
Health and Malaria Inspectors, 22, of whom 18 were Chinese.
Others (including technicians, subordinate and menial staff), 1,963, mostly Chinese.
Labour

The Labour Department is concerned mainly with—

(a) The inspection and registration of factories and the enforcement of the safety, health and other provisions of the Factories and Workshops Ordinance, 1937, and the regulations made thereunder, including those governing:—
(i) Employment in dangerous trades;
(ii) Employment of women, young persons and children in industrial undertakings;
(iii) Prevention and notification of accidents;
(iv) Fire precautions.

(b) The enforcement of the provisions of the Steam Boilers Ordinance, No. 32, of 1909.

(c) The provision of conciliation machinery for the settlement of disputes about wages and other terms of service and the fostering of satisfactory employer/employee relationships.

(d) The encouragement of modern trade unionism, and guidance in framing the internal organisation of the unions themselves.

(e) The implementation of such International Labour Conventions as can be applied completely or with modifications.

There is a Labour Advisory Board, under the chairmanship of the Commissioner of Labour, and constituted on a tri-partite basis. The Board is consulted on all important labour matters.

Existing labour legislation with which the Labour Department is principally concerned includes:—

(a) Factories and Workshops Ordinance, 1937 (No. 18 of 1937), which provides, inter alia, for the registration and inspection of factories.

(b) The Employers and Servants Ordinance, 1902 (No. 45 of 1902), which governs contracts of employment, with special reference to the determination of monthly contracts and the provisions necessary for contracts in writing for periods exceeding one month.

(c) The Trade Boards Ordinance, 1940 (No. 15 of 1940), which provides the machinery for fixing minimum wages rates (either time-rates or piece-rates) and overtime rates in trades where wage standards are unreasonably low.

(d) The Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance, 1948 (No. 8 of 1948), which provides for the compulsory registration of unions and defines the rights and obligations of unions and their members, and provides arbitration machinery.

(e) The Illegal Strikes and Lock-outs Ordinance, 1949 (No. 16 of 1949), which sets out the conditions under which certain strikes and lock-outs may be illegal. The Ordinance was passed in April, 1949, with validity for one year, but with the provision that it could be extended by resolution of the Legislative Council for any period not exceeding one year. In accordance with this provision the Ordinance has been extended to the end of 1950.

(f) The Steam Boilers Ordinance, 1909 (No. 32 of 1909) provides for the registration and inspection of steam boilers and steam pressure vessels, the enforcement of safety precautions and the examination and registration of boiler attendants.

Projected legislation includes a Workmen's Compensation Ordinance. Investigations are already made in all reported cases of industrial accident for the purpose of assessing and effecting voluntary compensation for injured workers.

Ordinances enforced by the Department in co-operation with other departments include:—

(1) The Public Health (Sanitation) Ordinance, 1935 (No. 15 of 1935), insofar as it provides for the maintenance of sanitary conditions in Factories and Workshops.

(2) The Dangerous Goods Ordinance, 1873 (No. 1 of 1873) and the regulations made thereunder insofar as these affect Factories and Workshops.

(3) The Gunpowder and Fireworks Ordinance, 1901 (No. 14 of 1901) and Rules thereunder.

(4) The Celluloid and Cinematograph Ordinance, 1923 (No. 23 of 1923).

(5) The Gasholders Examination Ordinance, 1938 (No. 1 of 1938).

(6) The Buildings Ordinance, 1935 (No. 18 of 1935).

(7) The Asiatic Emigration Ordinance, 1915 (No. 30 of 1915), which safeguards, inter alia, the interests of Asian labour passing through Hong Kong or proceeding to other territories.

Social Welfare

All social welfare work in Hong Kong has to be carried out against a background of unrestricted Chinese immigration, a densely overcrowded population, sensitivity to political events or natural disasters over the border in South China, and the absence of any abundant natural resources except fish, some stone, and sand. Moreover, for the overwhelming majority of both Chinese and Western residents, Hong Kong is not their real home.

The Social Welfare Office was established in August, 1947, as a specialised sub-department of the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs. Its principal responsibilities include—

(a) the probation service, and supervision of a girls' approved school;

(b) public assistance, and relief measures for destitute members of vulnerable groups, and for the victims of fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;

(c) building up community development through urban neighbourhood associations;

(d) children's clubs for underprivileged children, which provide training through informal classes, vocational hobbies, organised recreation, and simple children's co-operatives;

(e) protection of women and girls, and the suppression of those who traffic in them, exploit them, or ill-treat them;

(f) child welfare, including home visiting, placing of children in orphanages, etc., and liaison with orphanages;

(g) encouragement and development of all constructive youth welfare work.
A very great deal of the social welfare work in the Colony is carried out by over sixty voluntary organisations which in general belong to one or other of four distinct groups: Western charitable organisations, Chinese benevolent associations, institutions, and youth welfare organisations. Government provides heavy indirect subsidies to many of these organisations, and in addition grants subventions in cash to nearly thirty of them.

**Communications**

**Internal Communications**

Kowloon, on the mainland portion of the Colony, is the southern terminal of a railway system, extending to the north as far as Hankow in Central China with connections eastwards towards Hangchow and Shanghai and westwards towards Liuchow, Kweilin and Tushan. Since March, 1950, connection has been made with Shanghai and goods trains run between the Colony and Shanghai via Chuchow. Between Kowloon and Shumchun, a distance representing 36 kilometres out of a total of 183 kilometres from Kowloon to Canton, the railway is operated by the Hong Kong Government and is known as the British Section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway. In addition to local services and goods trains, a through passenger service to Canton is normally in operation. This through service was suspended in October, 1949, after the change of administration in Canton and has not yet been resumed (July, 1950).

Total passengers carried for the year ending 31st March, 1950, amounted to 5,264,430, goods tonnage 104,297 tons. Gross receipts totalled $7,783,413.

In spite of difficulties of construction, owing to the hilly nature of much of the Colony, and of maintenance, due to summer seasonal downpours of rain, Hong Kong is reasonably well served with roads. Although the total area of the Colony is only 390 square miles, over 400 miles of roads are maintained, 173 miles of which are in the island of Hong Kong, 106 in Kowloon, and the remainder in the New Territories. About 90 per cent. of these roads are of modern metalled construction. Along the length of most of them views of great scenic beauty are to be seen.

A large number of ferry services cross the harbour on various routes connecting the island of Hong Kong with the mainland and with the more important islands. The most frequent service is operated on the shortest harbour crossing between the tip of Kowloon Peninsula and the nearest point on Hong Kong island. A vehicular ferry service is also maintained between Hong Kong island and Kowloon.

There are motorbus services both on Hong Kong island and on the mainland, and an electric tram service is in operation on Hong Kong island from Shaukiwan through the city to Kennedy Town. A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels of Victoria Peak in addition to the excellent motor road. Rickshaws are still in use in the city areas.

**Shipping**

Hong Kong is the principal deep-water port in the South China area and in addition to its large ocean shipping trade has an extensive local trade carried on by river steamers and junks within the Canton Delta.

From the official statistics of Port Authorities it appears that Hong Kong ranked with Singapore as the fifth most important world port in the year 1948-49 on the basis of the total nett registered tonnage of vessels entered and cleared. Moreover, on vessels entered and cleared and on the total number of passengers handled in the port, the figures indicate that Hong Kong held pride of place amongst the major seaports of the world, with 66,815 vessels of all classes and 2,063,396 persons.

With the exception of junks and launches, it will be noted that these figures continue to show a progressive increase.

Passenger services to and from Europe continue to improve and are gradually approaching pre-war standards in comfort and frequency. The P. & O. Steam Navigation Company have continued to operate their fast monthly passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom and an increasing number of fast cargo liners of various nationalities now provide excellent accommodation for a limited number of passengers in addition to cargo. Passenger services to and from the American continent are provided at regular intervals under the American flag, and extensive passenger and cargo services to Singapore and Malaya, Indonesia, India, Burma, Africa and Australia are provided by a number of companies, including the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, the British India Steam Navigation Company, the China Navigation Company and the Royal Inter-Ocean Lines.

**Air**

Hong Kong is on the British trunk route from London to Tokyo and on the American trunk route from the U.S.A. across the Pacific. All neighbouring countries are connected by frequent services but from the beginning of 1950 air communication with the Chinese mainland ceased. The Colony’s airport is at Kai Tak and being only 15 minutes drive from the residential and business area of Kowloon is most conveniently situated for passengers. In the year ending March, 1950, 275,817 passengers used the airport and 22,073 aeroplanes arrived or departed on international flights. The airfield consists of two runways, the maximum length being 4,756 feet, but as the approaches are poor the largest aircraft are not able to use it. Nevertheless such types as Canadairs and Constellations call regularly on scheduled air services. The adjacent marine base is suitable for all types of flying boats.

The survey of a proposed site for a new airport was completed in June, 1950.
The following airlines operate regular services:

The Department of Civil Aviation administers civil aviation and operates the airport. It also maintains a Register of Aircraft and issues all types of aeronautical licences. An Air Advisory Board assists in formulating policy and an Air Transport Authority issues licences for the operation of regional air routes.

Hong Kong is now an important centre for the maintenance and repair of aircraft and the workshops of the two maintenance companies, Jardine Aircraft Maintenance Co., Ltd., and Pacific Air Maintenance and Supply Co., Ltd., are capable of complete engine and airframe overhauls. The Far East Flying Training School, Ltd., give instruction in flying and have a school of aeronautical engineering.

Postal Services

The large number of scheduled and unscheduled ship and air lines passing through Hong Kong enables the Hong Kong postal administration to institute excellent mail facilities with other countries throughout the world.
Direct money order services are in operation with Great Britain, Eire, Canada, Burma through Malaya, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Mauritius, Malaya, North Borneo, Norfolk Island through Sydney, Australia and New Zealand.

British postal orders are issued and paid at the General Post Office, Victoria, and paid also at Kowloon Central Post Office.

Telegraphic money orders are exchanged with the United Kingdom only.

The Trade Charge Money Order system is in operation with the United Kingdom and Malaya. Due to the effect of exchange control, it has not been possible to re-open money order services with countries outside the sterling area.

Telecommunications and Telephones

Cable and Wireless, Limited, maintain excellent services by the Hong Kong/Singapore, Hong Kong/Manila and Hong Kong/Jesselton cables. The first of these constitutes the main line of communication to the west and south, whereas the Hong Kong/Manila cable serves the Philippines and U.S.A. The capacity of these cables is ample to carry present and future requirements of priority and fullrate traffic without delay.

Cable and Wireless also maintain wireless circuits with London (via Colombo relay), Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Shanghai, Canton, Osaka, Macao, Bangkok, Taipei, Kunming, Seoul and Singapore. Radioplane links are in operation with the United Kingdom and Europe, U.S.A., Philippines, Shanghai, Canton, Macao, Japan and Formosa. An extension of this network to cover South Korea, Singapore and Australia is projected.

Commercial short and medium wave transmitters are housed at Cape d'Aguilar, receivers at Victoria Peak, aeradio and broadcasting transmitters at Hung Hom and marine receivers at Observatory Wireless Station. The Broadcasting Studios are in process of transference from Gloucester Building to Electra House (Cable and Wireless). The aeradio service controlled at Kai Tak Airfield covers point-to-point communications and air-ground control. D.F. bearings, radar, meteorological reports and navigational beacons are situated at Victoria Peak, Hung Hom, D'Aguilar and Waglan Island. V.H.F. systems are in use by the Police Department and Harbour Office.

Broadcasting transmissions cover a minimum period of 7½ hours daily in each of two programmes, English and Chinese. The local popularity of the programmes is indicated by the remarkable increase in the number of receiving licences, which in May 1950 was nearly 45,000.

Call signals are as follows:

- **VPS** for marine, 500 k/cs.
- **ZCE**, **ZCF**, **ZCG**, **ZCH**, **ZCI**,
- **ZCJ**, **ZEM**, **ZEN**, **ZEO** for Commercial Services as per Geneva lists.
- **ZBW** medium wave, European Broadcasting, 845 k/cs.
- **ZEK** medium wave, Chinese Broadcasting, 640 k/cs.
- **ZBW** 3 short wave, 2 k/w, 9,525 m/cs shared by ZBW and ZEK.

An automatic telephone service is provided by the Hong Kong Telephone Company, Limited. By May, 1950, over 20,000 direct exchange lines were in operation. The total capacity of the company's exchanges amounts to 25,280.

### Public Finance

Up to and including 1939, the Colony's financial year coincided with the calendar year, but thereafter the financial year was changed to the twelve months ending on the 31st March.

| Period          | Revenue     | Expenditure |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1939            | $41,478,052 | $37,949,116 |
| 1940-41 (15 months) | $70,175,114 | $64,787,556 |
| 1941-42 (estimates) | $56,786,000 | $60,642,715 |
| 1942-46 (Japanese Occupation) | - | - |
| 1946-47 (11 months) | $82,141,556 | $85,624,391 |
| 1947-48 | $164,298,310 | $127,701,174 |
| 1948-49 | $194,933,955 | $159,954,023 |
| 1949-50 | $264,250,543 | $182,121,726 |

The major sources of revenue are Duties, Earnings and Profits Tax and Assessed Taxes (Rates).

There is no general customs tariff in Hong Kong, import duties being confined to liquor, tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, toilet preparations and proprietary medicines and table waters. A special foreign registration fee of 15 per cent. of the value of a motor vehicle is payable in respect of any vehicle not produced within the British Empire. Earnings and Profits Tax comprises a tax on income from property, salaries, profits and interest, the standard rate being 10 per cent., which was increased to 12½ per cent. with effect from 1st April, 1950. Rates varying from 15 to 17 per cent. are charged on the annual value of property.

These measures between them accounted for total revenue of approximately $127 million (over £7 million) in 1949-50.

### Public Debt

The Public Debt of the Colony as at the 31st March, 1950, totalled $67,434,000 comprising four issues:

(a) 4 per cent. Conversion Loan raised in 1933 and repayable not later than the 31st August, 1953—$4,838,000.

(b) 3½ per cent. Dollar Loan raised in 1934—$5,600,000.

(c) 3½ per cent. Dollar Loan raised in 1940—$7,546,000.

(d) 3½ per cent. Rehabilitation Loan, 1973–78—$49,450,000.

(a) Redeemable by Sinking Fund, which is fully invested and amounted at the 31st March, 1950, to £232,253 12s. 1d.

(b) and (c) are redeemable by 25 annual drawings which were suspended during the occupation of the Colony but have since been brought up to date.

(d) This loan was raised in January, 1948, and the Sinking Fund at 31st March, 1950, amounted to £339,249 10s. 4d.

Bonds to the nominal value of $550,000 were purchased for cancellation in March, 1950.

### Trade

The following table shows the value of the Colony's imports and exports:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
|      | millions of $ | millions of $ |
| 1938 | 618·2 | 511·9 |
| 1939 | 594·2 | 533·4 |
| 1940 | 752·7 | 621·8 |
| 1946 | 935·5 | 765·6 |
| 1947 | 1,549·9 | 1,216·8 |
| 1948 | 2,077·5 | 1,582·7 |
| 1949 | 2,749·6 | 2,319·0 |
The volume of trade in 1949 thus showed an increase of over 38 per cent. as compared with 1948, and is yet another record. The most satisfactory aspect of this increase was the fact that it was in large part due to an increase of no less than 65 per cent. in trade with China, a point which is the more noteworthy in view of the troubled state of that country at the time.

Trade with the United Kingdom increased by 40 per cent. as compared with 1948.

**Currency and Banking**

The unit of currency in the Colony is the Hong Kong dollar. Until 1935 it was based on the Mexican Silver Dollar and the British Silver Dollar, and considerable fluctuation occurred until the silver standard was abandoned. As from 5th December, 1935, under the Currency Ordinance 1935, an Exchange Fund was established and it was provided that the note issuing Banks, namely the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Mercantile Bank of India, should surrender to the Fund all silver previously deposited against note issues, and should deposit full sterling cover for all notes issued thereafter. Since 1935 the value of the Hong Kong dollar has been maintained both before and after the Japanese occupation at approximately one shilling and threepence.

Notes of denominations from five dollar upwards are issued by the note issuing banks, and the Government issues notes of one dollar, ten cents, five cents and one cent, and coins of 10 cents in nickel brass.

The Colony is included in the sterling bloc and the authorised banks for dealing in foreign exchange are, in addition to the three note-issuing banks mentioned above—

- Thomas Cook and Sons, Ltd.
- Chase Bank.
- National City Bank of New York, Inc.
- American Express Co., Inc.
- Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank.
- Netherlands Trading Society.
- Banque Belge pour l'Etranger.
- Banque de l'Indo-Chine.
- Bank of China.
- Bank of Communications.
- Bank of Canton.
- Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank.
- Bank of East Asia.
- Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation.
- Chinese Postal Remittances and Savings Bank.
- Farmers Bank of China.
- China and South Seas Bank.
- Bank of Kwangsi.
- Young Bros. Banking Corporation.
- National Commercial and Saving Bank, Ltd.
- The Central Trust of China.
- Kincheng Banking Corporation.

In addition to these incorporated banks, there are in the Colony many Chinese banks which handle a considerable volume of remittances from Chinese living overseas to their relations in China.

In January, 1948, the Banking Ordinance, 1948, was passed according to which no company may carry on banking business without being licensed.

Further information about Hong Kong will be found in the Annual Report of the Colony.
