NORTH BORNEO

SITUATION AND AREA

North Borneo, including Labuan, lies between 7° N. and 4° N. and between 115° E. and 120° E. It has an area of 29,387 square miles, the greatest length on the mainland being 200 miles, its greatest breadth 220 miles.

CLIMATE

North Borneo is favoured by a relatively cool climate for a place situated so near the equator. The average mean temperatures are as follows:

| Location     | Maximum | Minimum |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Jesselton    | 88°F    | 72°F    |
| Sandakan     | 88°F    | 75°F    |
| Tambunan (situated in the high land in the interior) | 86°F | 66°F |

The annual rainfall varies from 60 to 180 inches according to locality. Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively drier belts. The wet season extends from October to February but the rain is not incessant, and during the wettest month there are intervals in which no rain falls and the ground dries rapidly. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and continues to the middle of April. The south-west monsoon lasts from April till October. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt. The wind is usually light during the south-west monsoon but short squalls are common in the afternoons and evenings.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

North Borneo occupies the northern part of Borneo, the third largest island in the world, and is bordered on the south-west by Sarawak, and on the south-east by the new Indonesian State of East Borneo. The interior of the territory is mountainous, culminating in Mount Kinabalu, which is 13,455 feet high and is the highest mountain in the East Indies. Most of the colony is densely timbered. On the west coast there is a narrow coastal plain which supports the main agricultural and rubber production of the colony.

The main towns are situated on the coast. These are Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau. Jesselton is now the capital of the colony. All these towns have good harbours.

Labuan, which now forms part of the colony, is a small island lying three miles off the mainland commanding the Bay of Brunei, and consisting of low undulating land. Victoria is the only town of any size, and it has an excellent well-sheltered harbour.

POPULATION

The population of the mainland was 270,223 in 1931, which was the year in which the last census was held. At the end of 1949 the population was estimated to be 345,000.

The native population in 1931 was 205,218, of whom 117,482 were Dusuns who are an agricultural community. Bajaus and Bruneis (fishing people), Muruts (pagan inland tribes), and Suluks (migratory coastal people) form the remainder of the native population. The Chinese, who handle most of the commercial trade and are responsible for a considerable amount of rubber planting and vegetable gardening, numbered 47,972 in 1931. Since that date they have increased to approximately 66,000. The total population in 1891 was only 67,062 so that it has increased fivefold since then.

Labuan had a population of 8,963 in 1941, consisting mainly of Malays and Chinese. It has increased by several hundred since then.

RELIGION

The Dusuns are very largely pagan, though a small number have embraced Mohammedanism, and there are also many Christians among them. The Bajaus are Malay-speaking and Mohammedan. The Muruts are a pagan race and use a dialect of their own. There is a small group of Bruneis who live on the coastal plains near Brunei, having emigrated from that state. They are Malay-speaking and Mohammedan. There are an appreciable number of Christians among the Chinese. The Indians are almost all Sikhs, and are Hindus.

HISTORY

Early in the sixteenth century, the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion of an unenlightened character reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued, and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. British and American traders endeavoured to get a firm footing in North Borneo, but it was not until 1847 that Labuan was ceded by the Sultan of Brunei. In 1872 he also ceded a large area to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory, and was made in perpetuity. In November, 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Ltd., which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882.

This Company governed British North Borneo until January, 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September, 1945, and was under military administration until 15th July, 1946, when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate Colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new colony of North Borneo on the same date. The island was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Brunei in 1847 as a place where H.M. ships might careen and refit, and was administered as a separate colony until 1890, when, at the request of the British Government, it was administered by the Government of North Borneo. It was incorporated in the Straits Settlements in 1907, becoming a separate Settlement in 1912.

CONSTITUTION

The constitution is regulated by letters patent, dated 10th July, 1946, under which a governor and commander-in-chief of the colony is appointed.
Under this instrument full sovereign rights are assumed over British North Borneo, following the North Borneo Cession Order-in-Council dated 10th July, 1946. Under the Labuan Order-in-Council dated 10th July, 1946, Labuan ceased to be a part of the Straits Settlements, and became part of the colony of North Borneo.

Authority was given under Letters Patent dated 9th August, 1950, for the establishment of a Legislative Council and Executive Council in and for the Colony, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto. An Order in Council which was brought into force on the 17th October, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council which legislates for the Colony; it is presided over by the Governor and consists of three ex officio members, nine official members and ten nominated members. Royal Instructions provide among other matters for the Constitution of the Executive Council of the Colony which consists of three ex officio members, two official members and four nominated members.

**Administration**

For administrative purposes the colony is divided into three Residencies: East Coast, West Coast and Labuan and Interior.

There are five districts in the East Coast Residency, four in the West Coast, and five in the Labuan and Interior Residency. Within the districts headmen of the villages carry on minor administration under native chiefs. These chiefs preside over the native courts which deal with offences against native customs. They also collect poll tax. The courts held by district officers are concerned with normal civil actions, breaches of the laws of the colony, and crime.

In the majority of the townships there are sanitary boards under the chairmanship of the Resident or District Officer. Each section of the community is represented on the board, whose revenue and expenditure form part of the general revenue and expenditure of the colony.

**Social Services**

**Education**

Primary education in the Colony is provided by four categories of schools; (1) schools maintained by government, (2) mission schools aided by block grants, (3) Chinese schools maintained by local Chinese communities, and (4) private and estate schools.

The total school population has increased by some 7,750 children since the year 1946. The number of Government schools has increased from 32 pre-war to 66 in 1949. All are in the primary stage (six years) and are designed by suitable curricula to meet the needs of an agricultural community. A Government Trade School was opened in 1949, and it is proposed to open a teachers training college in 1950.

In accordance with the provisions of a five-year plan prepared for this department, it is proposed to introduce a number of reforms and improvements which will bring the educational system of the colony more into accord with modern colonial practice.

**Health**

Hospitals with a total of 825 beds are situated at Labuan, Beaufort, Keningau, Papar, Jesselton, Kota Belud, Kudat, Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Semporna and Tawau. Medical officers are at present stationed at Jesselton, Labuan, Keningau, Sandakan, Tawau, Kudat and Beaufort.

Subordinate to each hospital are the dispensaries, of which there are 37. These are situated in the outlying districts and provide medical care and first-aid treatment to the smaller communities. They are staffed by senior dressers, who are under the supervision of the medical officer, and draw their supplies of drugs and other requirements through him.

A mental hospital is situated at Sandakan. Inmates at present total 55.

The leper settlement is situated on Berhala Island near Sandakan, and accommodates all lepers from the colony. There are at present 50 lepers in the settlement.

A health visitor is responsible for maternity and child welfare work. The supervision of the training and work of the native midwives is her responsibility. A midwives hostel is maintained, and after a hospital training and practical work in the districts under the health visitor, the pupils are returned to their villages and become village midwives.

**Labour**

The Department of Immigration and Labour is responsible for the inspection of conditions of labour in the colony, for the administration of the laws relating to labour paupers, societies, female domestic service and protection of women and girls, and for the general supervision of Chinese immigration. A joint labour adviser for the three British Borneo territories of North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak has been appointed.

**Communications**

The west coast is served by the only railway in North Borneo. This is a metre gauge line running from Jesselton on the coast through Beaufort (57 miles) to Melalap in the interior, a distance of 96 miles. There is also a branch line from Beaufort to Weston (20 miles). This branch has no physical connection with the main line, being situated on the opposite side of the Padas River and passengers and goods are conveyed across by pontoon ferry. The road mileage in North Borneo is small and totals 378, of which 153 is metalled. The longest unbroken stretch of road is Jesselton to Kota Belud, a distance of 47 miles, most of which is now metalled. Labuan is well supplied with coral roads, but most of them were badly damaged by heavy vehicles during the war, and they require extensive repair. There is a network of bridle paths on the west coast and in the interior, approximating 578 miles, and suitable for pony transport. River transport is only possible by launch on the Kinabatangan and Segama Rivers on the east coast. The Straits Steamship Company maintains a weekly steamship service between Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo. There is a thrice-weekly link by air with Kuching and Singapore operated by Malayan Airways Limited, a fortnightly link through Labuan with Australia and Hongkong, which is operated by Qantas Empire Airways, and a weekly link with Manila and Hong Kong, which is operated by Cathay Pacific Airways. The urban areas are served by a telephone system and have radio communication with each other. There is a W/T link with Singapore and neighbouring territories. The Hongkong/Singapore cable has been brought ashore at Jesselton and it is expected that cable communications will be inaugurated in 1950.
PUBLIC FINANCE

From the re-establishment of Civil Government in July, 1946, to the end of 1949, local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure. Grants-in-aid totalling $15,785,714 and Loans-in-aid amounting to $2,057,142 were provided by H.M. Government up to the end of 1949 for purposes of reconstruction. During 1949 a Loan in Aid of $200,000 provided during 1948 was converted into a Grant-in-Aid.

Revenue and Expenditure

| Year                  | Ordinary Revenue | Total Expenditure |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 15th July, 1946–31st Dec., 1946 | 1,833,259        | 2,550,697         |
| Jan., 1947–Dec., 1947 | 7,171,068        | 11,919,368        |
| Jan., 1948–Dec., 1948 | 8,043,016        | 10,856,092        |
| Jan., 1949–Dec., 1949 | 11,689,285       | 17,614,274        |

The principal sources of revenue were:

|                | 1948          | 1949          |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Customs        | 5,284,794    | 6,894,149    |
| Lands          | 593,979      | 637,969      |
| Posts          | 554,468      | 409,424      |
| Telecommunications | 128,259   | 178,293      |
| Forests        | 196,696      | 415,995      |
| Railways (Gross) | 543,442    | 737,032      |
| Miscellaneous  | 1,276,420    | 2,416,423    |

$8,578,058     $11,689,285

The main basis of taxation is at present indirect.

Income Tax legislation was introduced in 1949 but only profits of companies are at present taxed.

There is a general customs tariff for all articles entering the Colony. The highest import duty is on motor vehicles and accessories, 30 per cent. ad valorem. Machinery, manufactured goods, textiles and clothing carry duties from 10 per cent. to 15 per cent., but in most cases there is a preferential rate for articles originating wholly or partly within the British Empire. Agricultural products carry export duties from 5 per cent. to 15 per cent. The duty on rubber was changed in October, 1947, from a flat rate of 4 cents per lb. to a rate of \( \frac{1}{2} \) cent. plus 5 per cent. ad valorem.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

Before the occupation the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company issued its own notes, and these were circulated along with the notes issued by the Currency Commissioners of Malaya. After the liberation most of the Borneo Company's notes were redeemed by the military administration, though a few are still in circulation. The currency unit is the Straits dollar.

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has branches at Jesselton, Sandakan and Tawau. At Labuan, Messrs. Harrisons & Crosfield (Borneo), Ltd., act as their agents. The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, have branches at Jesselton and Sandakan, and Labuan.

TRADE AND INDUSTRY

The main industries of the colony are the cultivation of rubber (126,649 acres), tobacco (11,065 acres), hemp, coconuts and coconut products (35,000 acres), rice (90,195 acres), sago (14,023 acres). In the absence of later accurate statistical information these figures are taken from the 1938 returns and may be regarded as substantially correct. The manufacture of cutch, an extract of mangrove bark used in the tanning industry, is carried on on the east coast. Fishing gives employment to a large number of local natives and Chinese, also mainly on the east coast. The main domestic animals in North Borneo are water buffaloes, ponies, cattle, pigs, goats, and a few sheep.

About nine-tenths of the territory is still heavily timbered and this is worked on a considerable scale.

Owing to the loss of almost all records during the war there are gaps in the trade statistics of the colony, but the following figures can be given for imports and exports:

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| $       | $       |
| 1939    | 6,499,772 | 13,453,491 |
| 1940    | 9,978,419 | 20,270,502 |
| 1946 (July to December) | 8,155,886 | 4,009,356 |
| 1947    | 20,471,707 | 16,932,627 |
| 1948    | 25,419,172 | 29,741,954 |
| 1949    | 33,971,000 | 37,717,000 |

The 1941 figures had not been completed when the colony was occupied by the Japanese, and no overseas trade was proceeding normally until the civil government took over from the military administration in July, 1946.
