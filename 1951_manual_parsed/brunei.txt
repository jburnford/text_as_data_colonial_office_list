BRUNEI

SITUATION AND AREA

Brunei is a State on the north-west of Borneo lying between latitude 4° 2' and 5° 3' north and longitude 114° 4' and 115° 22' east. It forms two enclaves into the territory of Sarawak, by which it is bounded on all sides, or perhaps it would be more correct to say, historically speaking, that an intrusion of Sarawak formed by the basin of the Limbang River splits the State into two separate parts. It comprises an area of some 2,226 square miles, and has a coast-line of about a hundred miles extending from Brunei Bay in the east to the boundary with Sarawak in the west.

CLIMATE

The climate is of the tropical type and is characterised by uniform temperature, high humidity and copious rainfall. The heat is usually tempered by a slight breeze and the temperature rarely exceeds 90°F., the usual daily range being between 76°F. and 86°F.

The annual rainfall varies from 100 inches at the coast to over 200 inches in certain parts of the interior. There are no well defined seasons, but the rainfall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle of January during the period of the north-east monsoon.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The capital of the same name, or, to give it its honorific Arabic title, Darul Salam (Abode of Peace), is situated on the Brunei River about nine miles from its mouth and is distant by sea 758 nautical miles from Singapore.

At the time of the last census in 1947 it had a population of 10,620. Prior to 1910 the town consisted entirely of Malay houses built on nibong piles on mud flats in the river, but it has now spread over a portion of the mainland, partly reclaimed, on which Government offices and other public buildings and streets of shop-houses have been built.

Set in a wide sweep of the river, somewhat reminiscent of one of the smaller Italian lakes, this river town is in its way unique. At high tide under favourable conditions of light it takes on quite a remarkable beauty; reviewed at close quarters it is even more remarkably ramshackle. The houses are grouped together in small villages, many being connected by precarious bridges, and there the inhabitants carry on their multifarious activities in much the same way as if they were on land. Here, it is said, there are to be found still living old women who have never set foot on dry land.

The only other town of any size is Kuala Belait at the south-western end of the State's seaboard with a population of about 4,000. It is the centre of a rapidly expanding oil producing district and the local headquarters of the British Malayan Petroleum Company. Here, with municipal services, piped water supply, electric light, domestic gas, cold storage, cinema and other amenities, it is difficult to realise that within living memory it has been the scene of human sacrifices, and that only two hours up river there are pagan tribes treasuring the grisly relics of head-hunting expeditions of not so long ago.

POPULATION

The total population of the State at the census of 1947 was 40,657.

RELIGION

The majority of the population is Muslim of the Shafei sect. The remainder consists of pagans, heathens and Christians.

HISTORY

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the sixteenth century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the northern part of the island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta of the Sultan's court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the sixteenth century, and by the end of the nineteenth century it has fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the District of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 2,226 square miles, containing a population of 40,657, and consisting of the town and District of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Belait, Tutong and Temburong.

In 1888 an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of Her Majesty's Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident was appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued. At the beginning of 1931, however, the rapid development of the Belait district owing to the discovery of oil in commercial quantities necessitated the appointment of an additional officer and the title of Assistant Resident was revived.

Owing to the rapidly increasing importance of the oilfield area in Belait district the post of Senior Assistant Resident, Belait, was created on 1st April, 1950.

CONSTITUTION

The supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan-in-Council. The Council at present consists of twelve members, including the British Resident, with the Sultan as President. The assent of the Council is required for the enactment of legislation and all important questions of policy are referred to it.

ADMINISTRATION

The general functions of administration are carried out by a British Resident under the Governor of Sarawak as High Commissioner for Brunei. By the Treaty of 1906 his advice must be asked and acted upon in all questions other than those affecting the Mohammedan religion. The seat of Government is in Brunei Town. At Kuala Belait, the second principal town, is the Senior Assistant Resident's Office, which has control over the districts of Belait and Tutong.
The State is divided into four administrative districts, namely Brunei and Muara, Temburong, Tutong and Belait, under the charge of Malay district officers who are responsible to the Resident. There are also state heads of the public works, medical, agriculture, forests, police, customs, posts and telegraphs and education departments. Except for the Posts and Telegraphs Department these posts are normally held by officers seconded from the Sarawak Establishment.

At Brunei, Tutong and Kuala Belait there are sanitary boards appointed by the Government, which are responsible for the sanitation, conservancy, street lighting, rating and municipal matters within the area appointed by the board.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

The only schools maintained by the Government are Malay vernacular schools of which there are 27 in the State. Education is provided free and by the Education Enactment all male Malaysian children between the ages of seven and fourteen are required to attend Malay vernacular schools providing a school is available within two miles of houses. The number of boys attending vernacular schools is 1,842 and the number of girls 425.

The curriculum is based on that of the Malay vernacular schools in Malaya and includes reading and writing (in the Arabic and Romanized script), composition, arithmetic, geography, history, hygiene, drawing and physical training, as well as basketry and gardening at some schools. All instruction is in the Malay language.

In addition to vernacular education, religious instruction (Mohammedan) is given in some Malay vernacular schools. The classes are held on three afternoons a week.

There is no Government English school in the State, but there are four private English schools, one at Brunei, one at Kuala Belait and two at Seria. Three are maintained by the Roman Catholic mission and one by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited. There are also five Chinese vernacular schools in the State, maintained by the Chinese communities for the benefit of their children. In addition to education in Chinese, elementary education in English is given in the classes.

Health

Medical and Health administration throughout the State is under the charge of an officer of the Sarawak medical service with headquarters in Brunei town. In Brunei town there is a small hospital of 80 beds and an outpatient department. The Government also maintains three small dispensaries with accommodation for a few patients at Kulala Belait, Tutong, and Temburong, each under the charge of a dresser.

Four travelling dispensaries are in operation. One is in the form of an ambulance which travels the available road between Brunei and Tutong in one direction, and Brunei and Muara in the other covering some 46 miles, and three are river travelling dispensaries based on the static dispensaries at Kuala Belait, Tutong and Temburong.

At Kuala Belait there is a very well-equipped hospital, maintained by the British Malayan Petroleum Company, in charge of a medical officer. By arrangement with the company the medical services provided are made available to the Government on payment, and the medical officer carries out certain duties as health officer.

COMMUNICATIONS

The main road runs from Brunei town to Tutong whence communication is maintained with Kuala Belait via the beach which forms an adequate highway for motor vehicles at suitable states of the tide. Total road mileage in the State is about 137 miles, of which 43 miles are in the oilfield area at Kuala Belait and Seria.

The State is served by the ports of Brunei, Muara, Kuala Belait, Tutong and Bangar. Ships drawing up to 12 feet can navigate the Brunei River as far as Brunei town at any state of the tide. Vessels drawing 15 or 16 feet of water can go alongside the wharf at Muara where the former Brooketon colliery was located. There are bars at the mouths of the Belait and Tutong Rivers, but small ships drawing up to eight feet can enter at high water and in calm weather only owing to the strength of the surf on the bars. Vessels of the same draft can navigate the Temburong River as far as Bangar at suitable tides.

Messrs. Harrisons & Crosfield (Borneo), Limited, maintain a shipping service between Labuan and Brunei. There is also a weekly mail service between these ports run by the Brunei Government.

The Government maintains a central wireless station at Brunei town and a subsidiary station at Seria and Temburong. Through the Brunei town station the State is linked up with the wireless station maintained by the Government telecommunications department at Singapore.

The Government maintains a telephone service with a 50-line switchboard in Brunei with extensions to neighbouring rubber estates and to Tutong and Kuala Belait.

There is a bi-weekly air mail service to and from Singapore via Labuan carrying first class mail (letters and post cards). Printed matter and parcels are conveyed by surface transport between Singapore and Labuan weekly, operated by the Straits Steamship Company's vessels. Internal mails from one district to another are conveyed by motor launches and trucks.

Subsidiary silver coins are those of value 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. There are also nickel 5 cent coins and copper coins of 1 cent. Currency notes are issued in different denominations from 5 cents upwards.
