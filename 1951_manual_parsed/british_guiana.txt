BRITISH GUIANA

Situation and Area

British Guiana is the only British colony on the mainland of the South American Continent. It lies on the north-eastern coast of the continent between parallels 1° and 9° N. and meridians 57° and 61° W. It has a coastline of about 270 miles extending almost from the eastern mouth of the Orinoco River to the Courantyne River, and is bounded on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south and south-west by Brazil, on the east by Netherlands Guiana, and on the north-west by Venezuela. It varies in depth from 540 miles on the western to 300 miles on the eastern side.

The area of the colony, as recalculated in 1938 following a survey by an International Boundary Commission, is approximately 83,000 square miles, or approximately the combined areas of England, Scotland and Wales.

The capital is Georgetown (pop. 84,962), situated in latitude 6° 49' 30" N. and longitude 58° 11' 30" W. The next town of importance is New Amsterdam (pop. 12,305), about 67 miles south-east of the capital.

Climate

A.—Coastal Belt

The climate compares favourably with that of other countries similarly situated, and resembles rather that of a sub-tropical country. The mean temperature throughout the year is 80.3° F.

For most months of the year the maximum shade temperature is about 85° F., and even in the hottest months (August, September and October) a temperature of 90° F. is rarely recorded.

At night the temperature falls about 12° to 14° F. The night temperature averages 73° to 74° F., and in the coolest months of the year (January, February and March) it may reach as low as 70° F.

The heat of the sun is tempered by fresh breezes from off the sea which blow steadily and without intermission during the daytime for the greater part of the year, and, during the months of January, February and March, continue both day and night.

The general direction of the wind is northeast to east, and it varies from gentle to fresh with occasional squalls; but hurricanes are unknown. The nights throughout the year are cool and conducive to sleep.

The seasons of the year for the coastal areas are as follows:

- The long wet season—mid-April to mid-August.
- The long dry season—mid-August to mid-November.
- The short wet season—mid-November to end of January.
- The short dry season—beginning of February to mid-April.

The average rainfall for Georgetown in the county of Demerara is 92.33 inches, that for the county of Berbice being 12 inches lower, and that for the county of Essequibo 7½ inches higher. The most humid month of the year is May, and the atmosphere is driest during September and October. The mean average humidity for Georgetown for the past 99 years is 79 per cent.

B.—Middle Interior and Upper River Areas

Generally speaking, the climate is hotter and more humid in the interior and river areas away from the coastal belt, the most noticeable change being the absence of the fresh sea breezes which make living so congenial on the seaboard. In forest areas and on rivers surrounded by forests the day temperature is distinctly hot and trying. On the other hand the nights are noticeably cooler than on the coastal belt. The rainfall is heavier.

C.—Far Interior and Savannahs

Climate, temperature and humidity are modified by the varying physical conformations of the territory in the far south, and depend especially on the altitude and on the presence or absence of forest belts. As the name implies, the savannahs, in the upper Berbice River districts and in the south-west of the Colony, are free from dense forest and are more in the nature of park country, and here the temperature is slightly higher than in forest regions, and the rainfall markedly less.

General Description

The colony may be broadly divided into three zones, viz.: the low-lying coastland, the mountain region and the intermediate region.

The coastland comprises a low-lying, flat and swampy strip of marine alluvium which varies in width from about 10 miles in the west to about 40 miles in the east. Inland it rises in places to about 10 or 12 feet above high water. Its margin is protected from the sea or river by a dense growth of mangrove and courida bush, behind which are flat grassy savannahs which would mostly be inundated during the rainy season but for artificial drainage and sea defences. Almost the whole of the population and agricultural activity of the colony is concentrated between the Pomeroon River and the Courantyne River along this narrow coastal strip.

The mountain region, known as the Pakaraima Range, lies along the western boundary of the colony between the Wenamu River and Annai, a small settlement on the Rupununi River. It consists of undulating plateaux rising successively in bold sandstone escarpments and cliffs from 1,200 to 4,000 feet high, cut in places into deep gorges. The culminating point is reached in the flat-topped Mount Roraima, a plateau 22 square miles in extent more than 9,000 feet above sea level.

The intermediate region comprising the largest area of the colony lies mainly to the east and south of the above regions and, from an average elevation of 50 feet above sea level where it bounds the coastlands, rises gradually to the west between the river valleys and contains several irregularly distributed ranges and many isolated hills. The whole area is almost entirely forest clad except to the extreme south-west, where there is an area of undulating grasslands from the centre of which the Kanuku Mountains rise to an elevation of between 2,000 and 3,000 feet.

The country is traversed by many large rivers, which, with their numerous tributaries and branch streams, form a vast network of waterways. All the larger rivers of the colony are impeded above the tide-way by numerous rapids, cataracts and falls, which render the navigation of the upper reaches difficult.

In its scenery British Guiana affords very great contrasts. The tourist who visits the colony and confines himself to the flat and settled coastlands leaves with the impression that British Guiana is merely a mud-flat not entirely above sea level; but the traveller who penetrates any considerable distance into the vast interior must be greatly impressed by the tropical vegetation of lofty trees, tangled lianas and graceful palms, the hilly nature of the country, the many great ranges and curiously-shaped mountains, the elevated undulating plateaux, the extensive savannahs,
and the multitude of cataracts and waterfalls of surpassing beauty, which occur on the upper parts of the large rivers and their tributaries.

Situated on the Potaro River is Kaieteur—one of the recognised largest single-drop waterfalls of the world. It is nearly five times the height of Niagara, having a vertical drop of 741 feet, with a series of rapids and falls immediately below the pool, giving a further fall of 80 feet. Its width varies from 350 to 400 feet, and the depth of water passing over from a few feet to 20 feet according to the season of the year. These Falls, which are situated amidst grand and remarkable river and hill scenery, are a source of attraction to tourists. The journey from Georgetown to Kaieteur is now made principally by air and arrangements for trips to the Falls may be made with the British Guiana Airways, Limited. The Falls may also be visited by overland route via the Bartica-Potaro road.

**POPULATION**

The population at the census of 9th April, 1946, stood at 375,701 (186,433 males and 189,268 females). The population of Georgetown, the capital, was 84,962 on 31st December, 1949, and of New Amsterdam, 12,305. The estimated population on 31st December, 1949 (414,306), was made up as follows:

| East Indians | 186,762 |
| Blacks       | 148,001 |
| Aboriginals  | 9,934   |
| Europeans    |         |

**HISTORY AND CONSTITUTION**

The coast line of the country between the Rivers Amazon and Orinoco was first traced by Spanish sailors in 1499 and 1500; and, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, the search for the fabulous city of Eldorado stimulated exploration of this region. The territory was first partially settled in 1616 by Dutch merchants, who erected a fort and depot at Fort Kykoveral in the present county of Essequibo. This colony subsequently came under the control of the Dutch West India Company, which was formed in 1621. In 1624 a settlement was founded on the Berbice by Van Peere, a Flushing merchant, and held by him under a licence from the Company. The first English attempt at settlement was made by Captain Charles Leigh on the O'apock river (now French Guiana) in 1604. The effort, though followed up by Robert Harcourt in 1613 and 1627, failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, also turned his attention to Guiana, and founded a settlement in Surinam in 1650, which was captured by the Dutch in 1667, and ceded to them at the peace of Breda in exchange for New York. The Dutch retained their hold on the three colonies with more or less firmness, now yielding to England, now to France or Portugal, till 1796, when during the war of the French Revolution they were captured by a British Fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, and finally ceded to that Power in 1814.

In 1745 colonists from Essequibo settled on the Demerara River, and in 1773 Demerara was constituted a separate colony, but in 1784 it was reunited under one government with Essequibo, Berbice being under a separate government, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732. Under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Essequibo appears to have been established very early in the history of the Colony. Until 1773, Demerara was represented on it. In 1773 a separate Court of Policy was set up for the latter, but provision was made for representatives of the two Courts of Policy to form a Combined Council, and the two bodies were merged in 1789, when the two Colonies of Essequibo and Demerara were united. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government and the West India Company as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1787, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution) was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the
States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government and established a new one for the conjoined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and 1803, the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before.

The Council or Court of Policy consisted of 1, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequibo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequibo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequibo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each County,* each consisting of seven Members elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin d'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned or ceased to be an inhabitant.

In 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds. In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon annulled this arrangement, and to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation enacted that in lieu of the four above mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when the three provinces were united, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty, and from that date till 1891 the only constitutional legislation was the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory Act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution, as it existed up to 1891, may be summed up very briefly. It consisted of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The unofficial members of the Combined Court and Court of Policy were chosen by a College of Electors. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly were performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which were dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passed all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which was passed by the Combined Court.

During 1891 an Act was passed, which came into force in 1892, effecting a considerable change in the constitution. By this Act the administrative functions of the Court of Policy were transferred to an executive council, and the duties of the former became purely legislative.

The College of Electors was abolished, and the unofficial members have since been elected by the direct vote of the whole body of electors.

The Combined Court had the power of (1) imposing the Colonial taxes and auditing the public accounts; and (2) discussing freely and without reserve the items on the annual estimates prepared by the Governor in Executive Council; it could reduce or reject, but not increase, any item. The first of these powers was bestowed in 1796, when Governor Beaujon called the financial representatives into being, "with a right of voting only for the raising of colonial taxes and not further"; while the second was conferred periodically by His Majesty's Order in Council after each renewal of the Civil List and was co-existent with the Civil List.

The Court of Policy consisted of the Governor, seven official members, and eight elected members. It could be prorogued or dissolved at any time by the Governor and in any case was dissolved at the end of five years, and a general election had to be held within two months of the date of dissolution. The number of financial representatives, who with the Court of Policy formed the Combined Court, was six.

In 1926, at the request of the Secretary of State, a commission consisting of Sir Roy Wilson and Mr. H. Snell, M.P. (afterwards Lord Snell) was sent to British Guiana to report on the economic conditions. In its report (Cmd. 2841) the commission stated that one of the greatest impediments to development was the financial situation, and that it was essential that the Government should have power in the last resort to carry into effect measures which it considered essential, and that for this purpose an alteration in the constitution would be necessary. A local commission was appointed in 1927 to consider the steps to be taken to confer the necessary powers on the Governor and reported in favour of a change in the constitution.

In 1928, by an Act of Parliament, it was enacted that it should be lawful for His Majesty in Council to create and constitute, in substitution for the existing Legislature, a Legislature for the Colony of British Guiana in such form and with such powers as His Majesty in Council might determine, and from time to time to alter and amend the constitution of the Legislature and any powers thereof; and that any such Order in Council might provide that, notwithstanding the powers conferred on the Legislature thereby, there should be reserved to or conferred on His Majesty full power by Order in Council from time to time to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony of British Guiana.

Pursuant to this Act, an Order of the King in Council providing for the Government of the

---

* Demerara and Essequibo only are here alluded to.
Colony and for the constitution of a Legislative Council, was brought into operation on 18th July, 1928. The Court of Policy and Combined Court were thereby abolished and their powers were given to the new Legislative Council. The new Council consisted of the Governor as President, of ten Official Members and of nineteen Unofficial Members. The Colonial Secretary and Attorney-General were ex officio members, and of the nineteen unofficial members, fourteen were elected and the remainder nominated by the Governor. The persons who were elected members of the Combined Court became under the Order in Council the first Elected Members of the Legislative Council. It was also provided that any matter requiring a vote of enactment of the Council might be decided by the Governor in Executive Council notwithstanding that such decision might be contrary to the vote of a majority of the Legislative Council; but in such a case effect could not be given to the decision until the facts have been reported to the Secretary of State and his approval obtained. The second General Election under the new Constitution was held in 1935.

An Amending Order of the King in Council was brought into force on 13th August, 1935. This order amended the Principal Order with respect to the qualifications of voters and makes additional provision to counteract corrupt and illegal practices committed in reference to elections.

Under the British Guiana (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in Council, made on the 11th March, 1943, official representation on the Legislative Council was confined to the Governor, as President, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Colonial Treasurer; nominated membership was increased from five to seven while elected membership remained at 14. An elected member is Deputy President of the Council and takes the chair whenever requested by the Governor.

With the change in the composition of the Legislative Council, official membership of the Executive Council was reduced to four—the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General and the Colonial Treasurer; there are five non-official members.

Legislative Council Advisory Committees, first introduced in 1943, have been established in relation to various Government Departments. The chairman of each committee is usually a non-official member of the Executive Council. Membership of each committee provides for four or five members of the Legislative Council and the head of the department concerned.

As a result of a report of the local Franchise Commission, in 1944, the franchise has been extended to provide for the following:

Qualifications for Membership of the Legislative Council

(1) Membership is open to women on the same terms as men.

(2) The previous disqualification of ministers of religion, who possess the other qualifications required, has been removed.

(3) The financial qualifications for membership of the Legislative Council have been reduced from—

(a) possession of income of $2,400 a year to income of $1,200 a year or over;

(b) possession of property to the value of $5,000 to $1,000 or over;

(c) the holding of a lease to the annual value of $1,200 to one of the annual value of $300 or over.

(4) A literacy test in English is required for membership of the Legislative Council.

(5) Any person before becoming eligible for election to the Legislative Council must have resided previously at some period of his life continuously in the colony for at least one year before nomination.

Qualifications for Voters

(1) Qualifications for exercise of the franchise have been reduced as follows:—

(a) Ownership, occupation or tenancy of land from six acres to three acres.

(b) Ownership of land to the value of $350 has been reduced to $150.

(c) Occupation or tenancy of property of rental to the value of $96 a year has been reduced to $48 a year.

(d) Possession of income of $300 a year has been reduced to $120 a year.

(2) Every elector is required to pass a literacy test in any language.

The number of voters registered under the reduced franchise is 59,193. The first General Election based on this register was held on 24th November, 1947.

Sympathetic consideration will be given to the adoption of adult suffrage in five years time from the election of a new Legislative Council provided that experience during those five years of the working of the constitution with this extended franchise has proved to be satisfactory and that recommendations for the adoption of adult suffrage be made by the Legislative Council then sitting, or by any representative ad hoc body appointed by Government.

ADMINISTRATION

Local Government

The city of Georgetown is administered by a mayor and town council and is for purposes of administration divided into nine wards, for each of which a councillor is elected. There are in addition three councillors nominated by the Governor in Council. The revenue of the Georgetown Town Council in 1949 was £263,915 13s. 5d. and the expenditure £262,768 3s. 0½d.

New Amsterdam is similarly administered. The revenue and expenditure of the town council were £50,312 17s. 1½d. and £43,586 5s. 6½d., respectively.

The rest of the coastal area of the colony is controlled by local authorities under the administration of the Local Government Board which functions through the district commissioners of the eight administrative districts into which the colony is divided.

The local authorities are classified as village councils and country authorities. The area controlled by a village council is called a village district. Two-thirds of the councillors are elected by the registered voters of the districts and one-third appointed by the Local Government Board. The area controlled by a country authority is called a country district. All the members of a country authority are appointed by the Local Government Board.

Both village councils and country authorities have powers of voting funds and levying rates, of appointing officers and setting village and
sanitary works, subject, however, to the approval of the Local Government Board.

The combined figures for revenue and expenditure of all local authorities in 1949 were £81,809 5s 11½d. and £78,067 0s. 11d., respectively.

All coastal areas not under control of village councils or country authorities are administered directly by the Local Government Board as rural districts. In consequence of the establishment of a Department of the Interior during 1946, the Commissioner of the Interior is now responsible for the administration of the Mazaruni-Potaro, North West and Rupununi Districts.

**Law**

The Roman-Dutch law was in force in the colony until 1st January, 1917, at which date the Civil Law of British Guiana Ordinance Chapter 7, came into force. This enactment, along with two others, was the outcome of a Common Law Commission and Statute Law Committee. The criminal law is based upon that of Great Britain and is administered in the same manner. Indictments are preferred by the Attorney General.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

A state-aided system of elementary education was established by law in 1870—The Education Ordinance, Chapter 196. Elementary education is compulsory and free.

The elementary schools are denominational except for nine Government schools. The central administration is vested in a director and education committee, and the local control in managers, who are usually ministers of religion.

The number of schools receiving aid in 1949 was 266 with 71,249 scholars, and the total expenditure on administration and grants was £386,974.

Provision is made for higher education by two Government institutions in the city of Georgetown—Queen’s College for Boys and Bishops’ High School for Girls—in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England. One co-educational secondary school receives a grant-in-aid from the Government and there is awarded annually one public scholarship known as the British Guiana Scholarship of the value of £1,230, open to boys and girls and tenable at any recognised university or college in the British Empire. Twenty-five Government county scholarships, four Government junior scholarships and three centenary exhibitions, entitling the holders to free education at the Government secondary or other approved secondary schools, are granted to scholars of public elementary and private schools each year.

An Educational Development Committee was appointed in 1943 to consider memoranda by the Educational Adviser to the Comptroller for Development and Welfare in the West Indies. Some of its recommendations are now being put into effect. Many important changes and considerable expansion in the educational field are envisaged.

A Teachers’ Training Centre was established in September, 1928, and is now known as the Government Training College for Teachers. The Carnegie Trade School for Women provides a general course in cooking, laundrywork, housewifery and needlework and embroidery. Some of the students specialize in cookery, dressmaking or embroidery. There are 136 general course students and 29 ex-students in the Employment Groups. Revenue for 1949 was £3,323 and expenditure £9,468. A Government Technical Institute is being established which will provide, *inter alia*, trade classes for artisans (one-year course) and technical evening classes (approximately five years’ duration).

**Information Services**

A Bureau of Public Information has been set up “to put before the public the Government’s point of view and to be the channel for distributing all Government information and opinion as well as the official liaison between Government and the Press.” Special arrangements are made through a representative Indian body for public relations on matters of particular interest to the Indian community. Government funds finance a Tourist Committee, on which the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce is represented.

**Health**

There are seven Government public (general) hospitals providing beds for approximately 1,000 patients. The accommodation varies from six beds in smaller out-stations to 666 beds in the Public Hospital, Georgetown, Demerara, and an ambulance service is attached to the three principal institutions. There are also three private general hospitals providing a bed accommodation for about 300 patients.

There is also a mental hospital at Canje, Berbice, a leprosy hospital at Mahaiica, Demerara, and a tuberculosis hospital at Best, Demerara, providing accommodation for 500, 411 and 176 patients respectively. Mental, leprosy and tuberculosis clinics are held at various points in the colony and are supervised by the specialists of these institutions.

In addition to the dispensaries attached to public institutions, 14 Government dispensaries are established in the outlying parts of the colony. The proprietors of the sugar estates maintain 20 estate hospitals with a total of 1,347 beds and having dispensaries which are regularly visited by Government Medical officers.

Attached to the Public Hospital, Georgetown, are X-ray and electrical treatment, eye, ear, nose and throat, dental and venereal diseases departments. There is a Central Bacteriological Laboratory at Georgetown with smaller laboratories at district hospitals. Infirmarys are attached to the two prisons, the Alms House and the Essequibo Boys’ School.

The Public Health Department consists of two Health Officers with a port sanitary officer, a staff of 49 sanitary inspectors and 24 Health Visitors for general public health work.

There are three institutions where nurses are trained by qualified medical and nursing staffs, and a qualified sister-tutor is primarily responsible for the teaching of nurses at the Public Hospital, Georgetown. The European nursing staff consists of one matron and five assistant matrons.

There are also a Mosquito Control Service, comprising a Chief Officer, an Honorary Malariologist and the requisite staff of field personnel; a School Medical Service having in charge a School Medical Officer assisted by nine School Nurses; and a Medical Officer for the Interior.

The following specialist officers are attached to the Public Hospital, Georgetown:—Senior Physician, Surgeon Specialist, Assistant Surgeon, Ear, Nose and Throat Officer, Venereal Diseases Officer, Bacteriologist, Radiologist, and Ophthalmologist.
Labour

There is a Department of Labour which undertakes conciliation work between employers and workpeople, advises and assists trade unions and employers' organisations, and carries out inspections of premises in which workpeople are employed. The department keeps statistics regarding employment, wages, the cost of living and accidents, and has established, and keeps close contact with, standing organisations such as joint committees of workers and managements on sugar estates and the Georgetown port labour registration scheme. An employment exchange service for men, women and juveniles is in operation.

Welfare

The Social Welfare Division is a branch of the Local Government Department. Created in 1943, with assistance for five years under the Colonial Development & Welfare Act, it has now been placed on the Colony's Fixed Establishment.

Field officers trained in Jamaica are now stationed in selected areas on the coastline, and considerable progress has been made in promoting community life. The Division undertook the promotion of co-operative societies until the formation of a separate Co-operative Department in 1948. It has succeeded in encouraging cottage industries particularly the making of hats and handbags from local straws. The field officers work through existing women's institutes, youth clubs, or other organizations, and assist in the formation of such organizations where desirable.

A Youth Council has been formed with the object of co-ordinating and extending the activities of organizations engaged in the service of youth. The Youth Organizer, attached to the Department, acts as Secretary to the Council. Up to the present emphasis has been placed on the training of leaders.

The Division has also the administrative responsibility for the Probation Service, the Schools for delinquent boys and girls, the after-care of prisoners, old age pensions, and public assistance.

Communications

Roads

A number of roadways and trails are maintained by Government in the interior to serve mining and other areas.

The roads suitable for motor traffic are:

(a) From Bartica, the steamer terminus on the Essequibo River, to the Minnehaha River at 118 miles, crossing the Potaro River by a 360 feet span suspension bridge at 100 miles.

(b) A branch road from (a) above, at 73½ miles, to Issano landing at Mazaruni River, a distance of 50½ miles.

(c) A branch road from (a) at 89 miles to Tumatumari on the Potaro River, a distance of four miles.

(d) A branch road from (a) at 102 miles to Kangaruma on the Potaro River, a distance of four miles.

The object of the above road and its branches is to render the districts concerned accessible by road transport from Bartica instead of by the slow and dangerous navigation of rivers impeded by falls and rapids.

The Bartica-Potaro Road (a) and its branch to Kangaruma (d) are also part of the present day route to the Kaieteur Falls.

(e) The Camaria portage, a roadway 3½ miles in length, side-tracking the series of falls and rapids on the Cuyuni River known as the Camaria Falls.

(f) The Morawhanna-Wanaina Road, a road 61 miles in length from the left bank of the Barima River opposite Morawhanna via the Government Station at Mabaruma to the Government Experiment Station at Hosororo Hill, and with a branch road to the Aruka River at Kumaka Creek, ½ mile in length.

The following trails are passable to pedestrians, horses and pack animals:

The Rupununi Cattle Trail, 299 miles in length, from Takama on the Berbice River via Kurupukari to Dadanawa on the Rupununi River.

The Barima-Barama Trail, 29 miles in length, between Arakaka on the Barima River and Towakaima on the Barama River.

In addition to these trails there is a large mileage of forest trails, suitable for foot traffic only, serving sections of the mining areas and bypassing falls and rapids in the rivers. Examples of the latter are the portages at Amatuk Falls and Waratuk Falls on the Potaro River by which travel to the Kaieteur Falls is made possible.

River, Railway and Motor Transport

The three main rivers of the colony, the Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice, are navigable by ocean-going vessels of moderate draft for 65, 46 and 90 miles respectively.

The Courantyne River, the left bank of which forms a boundary of the colony, lies within Surinam. The colony, however, holds certain navigation rights over this river which is navigable by ocean-going vessels to a distance of 60 miles from its mouth.

There are also numerous other rivers which are navigable in their tidal reaches by smaller vessels, providing communication to a belt of country approximately 60 miles wide along the coast. Of these rivers the most notable are the Aruka, Barima and Pomeroon rivers on the coast to the north of the Essequibo, and the Mahaiaca, Mahacony, Abary and Canje rivers further south. Beyond this belt, owing to the nature of the country, the rivers abound in cataracts and waterfalls which must be negotiated by small craft of special design. Even here, however, the rivers form the main means of communication, the more important of them being the Cuyuni, Mazaruni, Essequibo, Potaro and Rupununi. There are many very long stretches of water in the upper rivers navigable by launches.

There is a good network of roads and a system of small canals connected with the Demerara and Canje rivers.

There is a railway from Georgetown to Rosignol on the Berbice River, 60½ miles in length, and one from Vreed-en-Hoop on the Demerara River to Parika on the Essequibo River, 18½ miles in length, both lines having been constructed by the Demerara Railway Company at a total cost of £694,621. The railways were acquired by the colony from the company in 1922 as from 1st January, 1919, and are now operated by Government in conjunction with certain steamer services under the control of the Transport and Harbours Department. The steamers operate ferries across the Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo rivers, and coastal and river services from Georgetown to Adventure on the Essequibo coast, to Bartica at the junction of the Mazaruni and Essequibo rivers, to Morawhanna in the north-west district.
and to Pickersgill on the Pomeroon River, and also from New Amsterdam to Paradise on the Berbice River.

Motor transport services are operated from the steamer terminus at Bartica to Garraway Stream on the Potaro River and to the goldfields district (115½ miles), and to Issano (124 miles) on the Mazaruni River.

A launch service from Bartica to Lower Camaria (12 miles) and a road service from Lower Camaria to Upper Camaria (3½ miles) on the Cuyuni River is also run.

A steamer service is also operated from Georgetown to Wismar on the Demerara River by Messrs. Sprostons, Limited.

Air

The British Guiana Airways, Ltd., operates a weekly service to the Rupununi, Potaro, North-west and Mazaruni Districts. The Company's planes are also available for charter flights.

There is an airfield at Atkinson Field. Airstrips have been completed at Manari in the Rupununi, at Mahdia in the Potaro, and at Aurora in the Cuyuni. A network of satellite landing strips has been laid down in the Rupununi savannahs and one at Ebini for local needs.

A service is run on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays from Georgetown to Bartica. The plane is chartered by the proprietor of a hotel (Mr. E. F. Correia) in order to accommodate his guests, but seats are available to any member of the travelling public who wishes to take advantage of this service. The North West Mail Plane is run fortnightly, alternating with the river service.

Posts and Telegraphs

Inland

The inland public telephone, telegraph and radio services are maintained and operated by Post Office Telecommunications.

Landline telephone and telegraph services are operated along the coastlands, and radio services to places in the interior.

Located in Georgetown

Central Telephone Exchange, with terminals for inland and overseas radiotelephone calls, also trunk and junction lines to New Amsterdam and district telephone exchanges.

Central Telegraph Office, connecting 50 postal telegraph offices.

Central Radio Station, for public radio-telegraph and radio-telephone communications with Telecommunications Department stations in the interior, and coastal vessels. Also provides communication with about 48 government and privately-owned radio-telephone stations in the interior.

Broadcasting Station ZFY, approximately 700 watts, on 5,981 kc/s, operated as a commercial broadcasting station by the B.G. United Broadcasting Co., Ltd. Broadcasts programmes for an average of 12 hours daily.

External

Cable and Wireless, Ltd., operate and maintain external cable and radio communications, including radio-telegraph service with ships and radio-telephone services with British West Indies, Paramaribo, Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Europe.

A well organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 10 hours from Georgetown and the north-west district in 24 hours. Georgetown, New Amsterdam and Bartica are lighted by electricity.

The surface mail communication between the colony and the United Kingdom is somewhat irregular. Mails are dispatched as opportunities arise by steamers of the Harrison Booker, and Royal Netherlands lines, and also via Trinidad.

Surface mails for North America are received and despatched fairly regularly by the Canadian National, Royal Netherlands and Alcoa steamships and also via Trinidad.

There is an air mail service with the United Kingdom via New York and also via Jamaica. The approximate time of transmission from Georgetown to London by this route is 4–6 days.

Air mails to North and South America are carried twice weekly by Pan American Airways, Incorporated, whose service passes through Atkinson Field, the air base 24 miles from Georgetown, leased to the United States under the 1940 Bases Agreement between Great Britain and the United States of America. Passengers are allowed to embark or disembark at Atkinson Field.

An air mail and passenger service is also operated by British West Indian Airways, Limited, between the British West Indies and Atkinson Field on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

A weekly service is also operated by B.G. Airways, Ltd., between Georgetown and Trinidad, St. Vincent, Barbados and Dominica.

Public Debt

During the year (1949) 5% inscribed stock 1949–69 to the value of $10,032,000 was converted into stock of equal amount bearing interest at 3% and redeemable 1975–80. The Colony's Funded Debt at 31st December, 1949, amounted to $23,709,103 (£4,939,396) exclusive of the liability in respect of the outstanding Railway Permanent Annuities and Perpetual Stock involving an annual charge of $84,378. Included in this sum is an amount of $1,084,872 representing loans from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund which were brought on charge. The greater portion of British Guiana's public debt was raised for the purposes of financing such schemes as sea defences, artesian wells, drainage and irrigation and sewage disposal, etc.

Deduct charges included in Item 1 set off against revenue of Item 8... $192,708

Most dutiable articles of British Empire manufacture or production receive a preference equivalent to one-half of the general tariff rates, but the preference on certain specified articles, viz., apples, beef (pickled), boots and shoes (not being of rubber), butter, cement, cheese, cocoa, confectionery, cordage, fish (canned, dried or otherwise preserved), lard, milk, pork, is a minimum of 66½ per cent. The minimum preference on flour is 48 cents a bag of 196 lb., on spirits 60 cents a gallon, and on wine, beer and ale 20 per cent. of the general rate.

The following are the principal revenue-yielding articles of import on which duty is payable on a specified weight or other measure of quantity:—Tobacco, flour, spirits, lubricating oil, motor spirit, wines and malt liquors.

Currency and Banking

The currency is sterling, the monetary unit of account being the dollar at the fixed statutory rate of $4·80 to £1. The circulation media consists of:

(1) Paper currency: (a) British Guiana Government currency notes in denominations of $100, $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1, issued by a Board of Commissioners constituted under the Government Currency Notes Ordinance, 1937. Issues of these notes in $2 and $1 denominations were first made in January, 1917; $5 notes were introduced in September, 1941; $10 notes in July, 1942; and $20 and $100 notes in February, 1943. The total circulation of all denominations at 31st December, 1949, was $9,166,000 or £1,909,583 6s. 8d.

(b) Bank notes issued by Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), Limited, and the Royal Bank of Canada in denominations of $100, $20 and $5, with a total circulation at 31st December, 1949, of $733,520 or £152,816 13s. 4d. The Governor is empowered by the Bank Notes (Amendment) Ordinance, 1943, to direct, by Order-in-Council, limitations on the amounts of bank notes which may be issued by any banker specified in the Order.

Government currency notes of the colonies of Trinidad and Barbados are legal tender by virtue of reciprocal legislation in 1941, but are not in general circulation.

(2) British silver and bronze coinage.

(3) A local 4d. bit.

Government currency notes are unlimited legal tender; silver and bronze coins are legal tender to amounts not exceeding 40s. and 1s. respectively.

An Ordinance to implement an agreement to provide a unified system of currency notes and coin for the Eastern Group of the British Caribbean Colonies, made between the Governments of Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica comprising the Windward Islands, has been passed by the Legislative Council and shall come into operation on such date as the Governor shall by Proclamation appoint.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), Limited, and the Royal Bank of Canada have branch establishments, with savings bank departments, at Georgetown and New Amsterdam.

In July, 1911, the Government Savings Bank, established in 1836, was amalgamated with the Post Office Savings Bank. At 31st December, 1949, there were 55 Post Office branch banks operating in the colony with a total depositors' liability of $1,3167,628 or £2,743,255 16s. 8d.
The Bank's accounting system was mechanized from 1st August, 1947, by the installation of three National Cash Registers Window Posting machines. This is the first Government Savings Bank in the Caribbean to install this up-to-date system.

**Production and Trade**

The staple products of British Guiana are sugar, rum, molasses, molascuit, concentrated lime juice, rice, coconuts, coconut oil, copra, coffee, balata and rubber. Sugar, rice and bauxite are the chief industries of the colony. Sugar and its by-products furnished 57.3 per cent. in value of the total domestic exports in 1949. Timber—including the famous Demerara greenheart, which is unrivalled for underwater structures, piling etc., and mora, which is becoming increasingly known and valued for railway sleepers—charcoal and hides are also exported. Cattle and pig rearing are carried on extensively.

Within recent years there has been a marked tendency towards the amalgamation of sugar estates and at present 16, run under separate management, are in active operation; the acreage under sugar in 1947 was 69,986 English acres and the area reaped was 57,247 English acres. The rice cultivation in 1949 was returned at 87,600 English acres, and the total acreage reaped in the spring and autumn crops was 102,700 English acres. Other crops grown, such as ground provisions, coffee, coconuts, cocoa, citrus and other fruit, and limes, amounted to 55,417 acres in 1949.

The forests of British Guiana represent one of the Colony's most important natural resources; they extend over approximately 70,000 square miles, representing 84 per cent. of the total land area of the Colony. These forests can be considered as falling within two zones, the near interior or accessible zone (approx. 14,000 square miles) and the far interior or inaccessible zone (approx. 56,000 square miles).

The forests are largely mixed evergreen rain forests with an enormous number of species; over 500 different species of trees growing to timber size are recorded from the near interior alone. In certain areas, however, a certain degree of gregariousness is encountered and there are extensive areas where one species is dominant: the mora forests (*Mora excelsa*), the greenheart forests (*Occotea rodiae*), the Wallaba forests (*Eperua spp.*).

The principal timber production is from greenheart, mora and crabwood (*Carapa guianensis*) and total production in recent years has risen to 3 million cubic feet. Of other products the most important are Balata gum (tapped from trees of *Manilkara bidentata*), firewood and charcoal. There are considerable and growing exports in all these commodities.

Exploitation of the forests has hitherto been carried out by private agency operating under licence on Crown lands, but a large-scale forestry development programme is now being undertaken by the Colonial Development Corporation; this programme includes the establishment of a modern sawmill with a capacity of 40/50,000 tons yearly, the introduction of new and fully mechanised timber extraction facilities, plans for market research and development of subsidiary industries. Extraction by other concerns is based on water transportation though this is limited by the presence of falls and rapids on the upper reaches of the rivers. Generally the use of light railways, tractors, winches and lorries is increasing.

During 1949, 174,236 tons of sugar and 3,126,177 proof gallons of rum were produced. The bulk of the production is high class vacuum pan sugar for refining purposes while certain quantities of the far-famed "Demerara crystals" are still exported.

Coconuts, coffee and cocoa are grown on the alluvial soils on the banks of the rivers. Rice is now grown to a considerable extent, chiefly by East Indians, on the lowlands within the empoldered areas. During 1949, 62,000 tons of rice were produced.

**Mining Operations in British Guiana**

Mining operations in the Colony have been confined principally to gold, diamonds and bauxite.

Gold has been produced since 1884, the maximum yearly production being 138,527 ounces obtained in the years 1893–1894. Production for the year 1949 was 21,098 ounces of bullion, representing an increase of 449 ounces on that for 1948.

Main producer was the British Guiana Consolidated Goldfields, Ltd., operating with one dredge in the Mahdia river, a tributary of the Potaro river, from which 9,851 ounces were recovered, being an increase of 2,400 ounces on production in 1948. The assembly of a second dredge is in hand and it is anticipated that this should be ready for test runs by the end of the year.

The Cuyuni Goldfields, Ltd., treated 19,000 tons for a return of 5,127 ounces, which in this case represented a decrease of 3,335 ounces on production for 1948. Underground operations suspended in the late months of 1948 have not been re-opened, all work being concentrated on the re-treatment of tailings left from earlier operations.

The Porthos Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Axel Johnson Co., Ltd., of Sweden, suspended operations just before the close of the year.

The Tikwah Mining Corporation carried out a curtailed prospecting programme throughout the year, including an examination of the gravel terraces on the old Peters Mine, Puruni river. Pilot milling operations on dump material at the old Tikwah Mine were also undertaken with a recovery of 198 ounces.

Messrs. Phang, Dragten and Baird, operating at "Golden City", North West District, produced 2,611 ounces for the year, an increase of 884 ounces on their 1948 output.

Anaconda British Guiana Mines, Ltd., a Company incorporated in Canada, which under Exclusive Permission had been prospecting for gold by modern methods over an area of 5,400 square miles embracing portions of the Demerara, Essequibo, Potaro, Mazarum and Cuyuni Rivres, have now suspended operations, and generally, prospecting operations throughout the Colony have slowed down.

The first discovery of diamonds was probably made in 1892 during working for gold at the Omai Mine, left bank Essequibo river, the present scene of the main prospections of "Anaconda". Output rose spasmodically until the year 1923 when 214,474 carats were obtained. As a result of the depletion of deposits which are workable by small miners production has steadily declined within recent years. Output for 1949 was 34,790 metric carats (valued at $1,174,163), as against 36,563 carats in 1948—a decrease of 1,773 carats.
The decrease was due to a drop in price in the middle of the year from $40.00 to $28.00 (British Guiana currency). Prices, however, soon recovered and had risen to $42.00 at the end of the year.

The Mazaruni district continued to be the main producer with 26,068 metric carats or approximately 75 per cent. of the Colony's production.

Haphazard prospecting was carried out in the Pakaraimas and along the Brazilian frontier. Some good quality stones were recovered in the Kopinang river, a tributary of the upper Potaro river, by 30 small operators, including some Brazilians.

The total tonnage of bauxite exported in 1949 was 1,757,650 long tons as compared with 1,873,166 long tons in the previous year. Despite this decreased export the value increased to $12,009,394 as compared with $8,514,827 for 1948.

The Demerara Bauxite Company, Ltd., continued to be the main producer with 1,649,876 tons. This Company and the Berbice Company, Ltd., carried out extensive prospecting operations throughout the year.

The Berbice Company, Ltd., experienced some difficulty in obtaining supplies for the construction of additional river barges which may have had its effect on their production, which was 107,787 long tons.

The Reynolds Metals Company and the Permanent Metals Company after carrying out geological reconnaissance and preliminary prospections abandoned their holdings during the year.
