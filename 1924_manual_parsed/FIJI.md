FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 176° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,063 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,130 square miles, Tavuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,083 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), tin, antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Dreketi river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the groups has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofiusa and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1921 to number 2,402, of whom two-thirds are Methodists, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra.

The natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity. A resident European commissioner is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates, who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner and any number of natives, not exceeding ten). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darkest of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its
The births among the native population in 1922 totalled 2,863, and the deaths 1,982. The birth rate was 33·39, and the death rate 23·12 per mil.

May to September is usually dry. Between December and April hurricanes occasionally occur.
blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1891, 1901, 1911, and 1921 respectively, is shown in the following table:

| Class of Population | Census of 1891 | Census of 1901 | Census of 1911 | Census of 1921 |

**History.**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the *Bounty*, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1836, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1889 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty’s Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the Chief of Bau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taviuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

**Climate.**

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Malarial fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1922 was 91°0' in January, and the lowest 55°0' in November. The total rainfall during the year was at Suva, 158·10 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to September is usually the driest period. Between December and April hurricanes or heavy gales occasionally occur.
Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 31st January, 1914, as amended by Letters Patent of 20th July, 1916. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer, and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and not more than twelve nominated members (including one Indian member), seven elected members, two native members. The natives retain a large share of self-government. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by a triennial meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," which has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva numbered 1,434 at the census of 1921.

Shipping.

Suva and Levuka are ports of entry, and had, on 31st December, 1922, seven steam and five sailing vessels registered of a total net tonnage of (steam), 3,091 tons, and (sailing), 238 tons.

During the year 1922 sea going certificates were issued by the Fiji Marine Board to 141 vessels, of a total tonnage of 2,960 tons, of which 68 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 2,294), 48 by Natives (tonnage 426), 13 by Chinese (tonnage 133), 6 by Indians (tonnage 54), and 6 by Japanese (tonnage 73).

The number of merchant vessels entered at the three ports of entry in the Colony during 1922, is steam, 123, of 336,399 tons; and 5 sailing, of 1,809 tons; of these vessels, 123 were British,

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1877 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva, on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by the Municipal Institutions Ordinance, 1909. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property.

The revenue and expenditure in 1922 were:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Suva municipal council | £32,735 | £34,959 |
| Levuka | £3,955 | £3,807 |

Total ... ... £36,690 £38,766

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provided for the creation of school boards in constituted districts. Under this Ordinance school boards were created in Suva and Levuka, and in each of these towns a public school for children of European descent was established, the cost of education being borne by a school rate on the town and a Government grant based on the attendance.

The Education Ordinance, 1916, replacing the 1890 Ordinance aims at the establishment of an education system to meet the needs of the Colony as a whole and of the various races. A Board of Education has been created, of which the Governor is Chairman, and a Superintendent of Schools has been appointed. School Committees in education districts are appointed by the Governor. The Ordinance gives power to the Board to establish Government schools both secondary and primary, and to give assistance to denominational schools. Rules and Regulations for Government and assisted primary schools were made by the Board of Education in May, 1917. An Ordinance to make compulsory the Registration of Schools and Teachers was passed in 1918.

The public school for Europeans in Suva has been replaced by two grammar schools, one for boys and one for girls; and the Levuka Public School is now under Government control. The highest enrolment during 1922 at the Boys Grammar School, Suva, was 101; at the Girls Grammar School, Suva (where boys under 8 are taken), 125. The average roll in 1921 for the Levuka Public School was 203 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School at Nassiu, near Suva, is intended to provide for the higher education of natives, and is maintained from public revenue. The number of boys on the roll during 1922 was 84.

Schools for the primary education of Fijians may be conducted by the Methodist and Roman Catholic Missions, by the Provincial Councils, or by Government. Provision has been made for the establishment of 5 Provincial schools, three of which, at Lau, Yavuni and Lodoni are in charge of European headmasters. The Methodist Mission has 866 schools with an attendance of 14,046 pupils; the Roman Catholic Mission has 127 schools with 2,983 pupils.

There are 58 Government and assisted schools, 20 for Indians, 28 for Fijians, 2 receiving both Indians and Fijians, and 5 for Europeans, other races and half-castes. They have 4,039 pupils, of whom 1,490 are Indians, 2,064 are Fijians, and 485 are Europeans, other races and half-castes. They have 53 European, 60 Fijian, and 24 Indian teachers. There are village schools in the great majority of native villages. These are supervised by native teachers and instruction is given in the vernacular.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka, and Lautoka, and the Bank of New Zealand at the two former places. No return of coin in circulation is available.

Under Ordinance IV., of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened during 1908. At end of 1922, there were 2,353 depositors and
70,527l. in deposits. Arrangements were made during 1914 for the issue of Government Currency Notes. At the end of 1922, the circulation of Government Currency Notes was 326,327l.

**Industries.**

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoonut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3‡ tons were exported. In the meantime the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney, Auckland and Melbourne. In the year 1921, however, the Commonwealth Government imposed a prohibitive duty on imported bananas, thus effectively closing Fiji’s principal market.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples and citrus fruits.

The following table will illustrate the course of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruit | Copra |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
|      | tons. | £ . | tons. | £ . |
| 1875 | 96 | 3,417 | 97 | 3,871 |
| 1890 | 16,291 | 244,585 | 57,563 | 4,887 |
| 1900 | 32,981 | 959,967 | 38,113 | 15,806 |
| 1910 | 61,790 | 893,363 | 97,991 | 15,624 |
| 1920 | 72,985 | 2,02,560 | 96,185 | 14,866 |
| 1921 | 71,731 | 1,342,874 | 48,912 | 21,357 |

The other principal exports in 1922 consisted of:—Beche-de-mer, 2,986l.; cocoanuts, 4,928l.; hides, 3,790l.; molasses, 10,136l.; trochus shell, 16,19l.

Considerable quantities of rice are grown and a Government rice mill has been established. The area under sugar was reduced in 1917 owing to labour difficulties.

Dairying and rubber planting may now be regarded as established industries.

Many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted for cattle and sheep raising.

The total trade of the Colony in 1922 was £2,809,23s, made up as follows:

- **With United Kingdom** ... £362,037
- **British Empire** ... 2,093,068
- **Foreign Countries** ... 361,619

**Parcels Post included in above**
**Ships Stores and Bunkers** ... 2,511

There is a direct quarterly cargo service with the United Kingdom by the New Zealand Shipping Company’s Line of steamers.

**Means of Communication.**

There is regular steam communication with Australia and New Zealand, and a monthly service with Canada. Inter-island communication is maintained by regular steamer or cutter services.

Postage to the United Kingdom, India, the Australian States, New Zealand, and British Colonies is 2d. for 1 oz., 1d. for every additional oz. To other countries in the Postal Union 3d. per oz., every succeeding oz. 1½d.

Internal postal rates: letters, 2d. for 1 oz., 1d. for every additional oz.; newspapers not exceeding 4 oz., ½½d., exceeding 4 oz., 1½d.; if registered in Fiji for transmission by post. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is 3 lbs. 2½d., 7 lbs. 4½d., and 11 lbs. 5s. 9½d. There is also a parcel post with the Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, India, Ceylon and the United States of America. The rates of postage are as follows:

- **Australia and New Zealand**—1 lb., 8½d.; every additional lb. up to 11 lbs., 6½d.
- **Canada**—1 lb., 6½d.; ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 6½d.
- **India and Ceylon**—1 lb., 1s. 4½d.; every additional lb. up to 11 lbs., 1s. 2½d.
- **United States of Ameriaca**—1 lb., 6½d.; every additional lb. up to 11 lbs. 6½d.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

The Imperial Postal Order system has been adopted by this Colony.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco, or Vancouver, in about 30 days.

There is a telephone from Suva to Lautoka, a distance of 125 miles, which is maintained by the Colonial Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Union Steamship Company jointly. There is a telegraph line between Suva and Levuka, a distance of 54 miles. A system of wireless telegraphy has been established in the Colony, and there are now stations at Suva in the island of Viti Levu, at Labasa and Savusavu in the island of Vanua Levu, and at Waiyevo, Taviuni. Telephone Exchanges have been established at Suva, Levuka, Nausori, Navua, and Taviuni.

There is no railway in the Colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. own various tramlines connecting their estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands, and more are in process of construction. Suva is connected by cable with Southport (Queensland) and Auckland, via Norfolk Island, and with Vancouver, via Fanning Island.
