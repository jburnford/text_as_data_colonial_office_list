THE GOLD COAST.

THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast Colony, with Ashanti, the Protected Northern Territories, and the British mandated territory of Togoland, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, between 3° 7' W. long. and 1° 14' E. long., and is bounded on the west by the French colony of the Ivory Coast, on the east by the French mandated territory of Togoland, on the north by the French Soudan, and on the south by the sea.

The area of the Colony is 23,490 square miles, of Ashanti, 24,660, of the Northern Territories, 30,600, and of the British mandated territory of Togoland, 13,040.

The Colony is inhabited by a large number of native tribes, whose customs and forms of government are of a more or less similar character. Each tribe has its own head chief and every town or village of the tribe a chief or headman.

The head chiefs and chiefs form the council of the tribe, and assist in dealing with matters affecting its general welfare. The succession to the chiefs' stools is for the most part hereditary by the female side, the heir to the stool being the son of the occupant's eldest sister, or failing male offspring by his sisters, his brothers according to seniority, and back from them to the male offspring of his uncles on the father's side.

The principal sea coast tribes are the following:—Apollonia, Ahanta, Chamah, Commendah, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winnebah, Assin Gomoa, Ga, Adangme, Awuina, Agbosomoe and Aflao. Some of these, on account of tribal differences, are split up into divisions more or less independent of each other, and as education and civilisation spread, a tendency to further disintegration develops itself.

In the interior of the Colony the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wassaw, Sefwi, upper and lower Denkera, Tufel, Assen, Estikuma, Ajumako, Akim Abuakwa, and Akim Kotoku, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Shai and Ningo.

For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into three provinces, each presided over by a Provincial Commissioner. These Provinces are further divided into districts, presided over by District Commissioners. Many of these Officers perform judicial duties as magistrates in addition being in administrative charge of their district. The districts are as follows:—

1. Western province:—Districts—Axim, Ankobra, Tarquah, Secondee-Dixcove, Sefwi and Aowin.
2. Central province:—Districts—Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winnebah, Western Akim.
3. Eastern province:—Districts—Accra, Birrim, Akwapim, Volta River, Addah-Quittah.

History.

It is said that as early as the reign of Edward I. (1272-1307) English navigators made voyages to the Gold Coast, and that a hundred years later French adventurers reached the coast, who, about 1364, built several lodges or forts, one being at Elmina, parts of which are supposed to have been subsequently incorporated in the present castle there. No definite evidence however exists to support these claims, although it is quite possible they are both correct; indeed, the natives until quite recently used to point out a hill near Takoradi as the site of a French fort built there many years ago. For our earliest knowledge of the Gold Coast we are indebted to the Portuguese navigators of the later years of the 14th and first part of the 15th centuries. They had been slowly extending their voyages down the West Coast of Africa, and it is recorded that in 1471 Juan de Santarem and Pedro d'Escoobar traded for gold in the neighbourhood of Elmina or Chama. They made the first European settlement eleven years later, when an expedition under Diego d'Azambuja built and garrisoned the fort San Jorge da Mina (Elmina), the materials for which he brought with him from Portugal. Several other settlements were founded, and the country was claimed for the King of Portugal by virtue of a Papal Bull granted in 1430, which gave to Portugal all the islands already discovered and all future discoveries in Guinea. This Bull was confirmed a few years after the foundation of Elmina by Pope Sextus IV. The Portuguese remained in undisputed possession for over fifty years until British merchant adventurers commenced trading on the coast, the earliest voyages of which records remain being those of Thomas Windham and Antonio Anee Pintado, in 1553, John Lok, in 1554, and William Townson, in 1555, 1556 and 1558. The British made no settlements at this time and their trade soon lapsed altogether until the early years of the 17th century. The Dutch, however, who made their first appearance on the coast in 1598, rapidly became serious rivals of the Portuguese and practically terminated their occupation by capturing Elmina in 1637, and Fort St. Anthony at Azim in 1642. After the activities of the Elizabethan sailors and merchant companies had come to an end, the English connection with the Gold Coast was revived by the efforts of a series of merchant companies, the first of which, called the "Company of Adventurers of London trading into Africa" was founded in 1618, but did not enjoy a successful career. Another company was formed in 1631, which established the first British fort on the coast at Kormantin, and lodges at several other places. This company was engaged in the slave trade, as were also the other European nations. Its charter was renewed in 1661, but in 1682 a new company was incorporated as the "Company of Royal Adventurers of England trading to Africa." Settlements were formed at Anamabu, Accra, and at Cabo Corso (Cape Coast), at which place the castle was built about this time by the English, although the Portuguese probably had a lodge there earlier. Three other European nations succeeded in acquiring territories on the Gold Coast, viz.:—The Swedes, the Brandenburghers, and the Danes. The first-mentioned built the fort of Christiansborg, near Accra about 1645, but were driven out by the Danes in 1667, and retired from the Coast. The Brandenburghers established "Fort Great Fredericksburg" at Princes River in 1682, and "Fort Dorothea" at Akwida in 1685, but their enterprise does not seem to have been prosecuted with much vigour, and was finally abandoned in 1720, their possessions falling into the hands of the Dutch. The Danes, however, after first selling the Fort at Christiansborg to the Portuguese, and re-buying it three years later, rapidly improved their position, building forts at several stations to the East of Accra, as far as Addah and Quittah, and exercising a kind of Protectorate over Akwapim, and the Volta River district.
The third English Company was not successful. The Dutch traders spared no efforts to get rid of their rivals, and in consequence of their aggression, an expedition was sent by Charles II. in 1684, under the command of Captain Holmes, which recaptured Cape Coast, taken the previous year by the Dutch, and all the other Dutch forts, with the exception of Elmina and possibly Axim. In the following year, however, the Dutch Commander de Ruyter recaptured all the lost Dutch forts, with the exception of Cape Coast; and the treaty of Breda, 1667, left affairs in the Gold Coast in this condition. The fourth English Company was incorporated in the year 1672 under the name of the "Royal African Company of England." Under its influence English interests steadily advanced, and forts were established at Dixcove, Secondee, Commendah, Anamabu, Tantumquerry, Winnebah, Acora. The abolition of the exclusive privileges which the Royal African Company enjoyed, led to its decline and eventual dissolution in 1752. By the Acts of Parliament 23 George II., c. 31, and 26 George II., c. 40, a fifth trading Corporation, called the "African Company of Merchants" was formed, the membership of which was open to all British traders on payment of a fee of 40/-, compensation being paid for its charter and property to the Royal African Company. An annual subsidy was granted by Parliament to the newly-formed Company, until 1821, when by the Act 1 & 2 George IV., c. 28, the Company was dissolved and its possessions vested in the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlement, the seat of government being at Sierra Leone.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Issamankow, where, on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Acora, in 1826. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831, between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4,000/- a year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his Government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the slave trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieutenant-Governor appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of native affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

Hitherto the forts of the various nations were intermixed with each other, and there was no defined limit as to where the influence of one or the other began or ended. The imposition of Customs duties was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by the existence of the free ports of a rival nation within a stone's throw, as it were, of the duty-ports. On the 24th of January, 1850, by Letters Patent, the Settlements on the Gold Coast ceased to be dependencies of Sierra Leone, and in the same year, by the purchase of the forts and protectorate of the Danes, the Coast line from Christiansborg to Quittah and the districts of Shai, eastern and western Krobo, Akwapim, Akwamu, and Krepé, were acquired by England. By a Commission dated the 19th February, 1866, the Gold Coast Settlements were reunited to the Colony of Sierra Leone under one Governor-in-Chief. In 1867, a convention was made with the Dutch by which the portion of the Coast lying to the west of the Sweet River, which flows into the sea between Cape Coast and Elmina, was allotted to Holland, England taking all the territory to the east of the river, and a customs union between the two nations was established. The Dutch, however, found many difficulties in the way of their occupation of the forts and possessions received from the English in exchange for those of their own lying to the East of the boundary line. The native tribes refused to recognise their authority, and the prospect before them was that of a long series of petty wars with no reasonable hope of profit to be gained in the future. The result was the convention made between England and Holland in 1871, by which the Dutch transferred all their forts and possessions on the Coast to the English, and Great Britain obtained at last the sole sovereignty and control of the territory from Half-Assinie to Aflao. The forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872. The present extent and limits of the colony are defined in the Order in Council of 1906.

Constitution.

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by Letters Patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Four unofficial members were appointed to the Legislative Council.

By Royal Instructions dated 20th September, 1916, under Letters Patent of the same date, all previous Instructions were revoked and the Executive and Legislative Councils were re-constituted. The Executive Council now consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Treasurer, the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, with the Governor as President. The Legislative Council consists of the members of the Executive Council and, in addition, the Comptroller of Customs, the Director of Public Works, the General Manager of Railways, and the Commissioners of the Eastern, Central and Western Provinces, as ex officio members, and such unofficial members as may be appointed by the Crown. At present
there are nine unofficial members, viz., three European, three Paramount Chiefs, and three other members of the native community.

Law and Justice.

The Law of the Colony is the Common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England, on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed at various periods since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Ordinance passed in 1876.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court presided over by the Chief Justice, Divisional Courts held in different parts of the colony by four puisne judges, and some twenty-five inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction, of which five are presided over by Police Magistrates and the remainder by District Commissioners. The Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and decides appeals from the inferior courts in civil matters, while the Chief Justice and judges in their respective provinces have powers of revision of the decisions of the Magistrates and Commissioners in criminal cases. Appeals from Divisional Courts are heard by a full court.

Native law is administered in all the Courts, in as far as it is not incompatible with any Statute or Ordinance, and not repugnant to natural justice.

As between natives of the Colony, recognised tribunals have a limited criminal and a limited exclusive civil jurisdiction in cases where all parties are natives of the Gold Coast Colony, Ashanti or the Northern Territories.

There is an appeal from Native Tribunals to the District Commissioner's Court, but where the title to land is in dispute a District Commissioner's Court is presided over by a Provincial Commissioner.

Prisons.

There is a Central Prison at Sekondi, especially constructed for long-sentence convicts; while Usher Fort, Accra, is also adapted for the same purpose. Next in importance are James Fort Prison, Accra, and the prisons at Coomassie and at Cape Coast (a portion of Cape Coast Castle, adapted as a prison). Local prisons also exist at most of the district headquarter stations, some being specially built prisons on a small scale, others being old forts adapted.

At Accra and Sekondi convicts are taught trades, and remunerative industries are carried on. Convicts with sentences of two years or over are placed on the marks system.

Climate.

The climate, though hot and damp, is cooler than that of most tropical countries situated in similar latitudes. It is not in itself unhealthy; but the prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases, demands the taking of all possible precautions. The exact death rate among the non-official European population is difficult to ascertain, but the rate per 1,000 is believed to have been 8·9 in 1921. Among the European officials the death rate per 1,000 was 18·22 in 1921. No data are at hand for estimating the death rate among the natives. Infant mortality is great. The mean temperature in the shade at Accra averages 78·66° F., and was 79·84° F. in 1921. The average annual rainfall at the same place is about 33·06, and was 34·43 inches in 1921. The rainfall varies with the physical configuration of the country, and is very great in Axim and the mining districts of Tarkwa, Upper and Lower Wassaw, etc. The "first rains," or rainy season proper, begin in March and end in July; the "latter rains" are spread over the months of September and October. The rainy season is marked by a considerable fall in temperature, which is found to be refreshing to many Europeans, but proves trying to some. The Harmattan season begins in December and ends in February. It is characterised by a cool wind which is dry and bracing.

Mail and Steamship Services.

The African Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., are under contract with the Postmaster-General for conveyance of His Majesty's mails between Liverpool and the West and South-West coasts of Africa.

Regular sailings are maintained between Liverpool and West African ports for mails, passengers and cargo. There are regular sailings from London.

Local Agents:—The Swiss African Trading Company.

Harbours.

The Gold Coast has always been at a great disadvantage, in that it possesses no deep water harbour. Jetties have been built at Sekondi, but owing to the continuous silting up of the harbour they cannot be used to their full capacity. At Accra a breakwater and jetty have also been constructed, but here again the silting difficulty prevents the use of anything except surf boats.

After very careful enquiries and surveys a site was selected for a Deep Sea Harbour at Takoradi, near Sekondi, and a scheme prepared and submitted. Financial considerations preclude the undertaking of the full scheme at present, but a modified scheme to provide pier and wharfage accommodation and other facilities at an estimated cost of £60,000 was authorised in 1921. Construction commenced in December, 1921.

Internal Communications.

Railway communication now consists of the Sekondi-Coomassie line (167 miles), with branches Tarquah to Preates, Akyem to Insuta and Inohaban Junction to Inohaban (Sekondi) Water Works, and the Accra-Coomassie line (196 miles). All these lines are 3' 6" gauge. There is a branch line Accra to Weshiang (Accra Water Works) which is only 2' 6" gauge.

A line is being constructed starting from Huni Valley on the Sekondi-Coomassie line and running eastward through the Central Province of the Colony to the neighbourhood of Kade, a distance of approximately 120 miles.

In 1921, the railway revenue was £706,107, and the working expenditure £55,249. The total number of miles open for traffic at the end of 1921 was 302, and the capital cost £681,192.

The roads maintained by the Department of Public Works are:

- In the Eastern Province and Togoland, 249½ miles.
- In the Central Province, 257½ miles.
- In the Western Province, 95 miles.

In addition there are a large number of roads which have been constructed and are maintained by the Chiefs, and can be used by motors at any rate during the dry weather. Where rivers and swamps have to be crossed, ferries have been instituted which are controlled for the most part by the Chiefs, who are empowered to levy a small fee. In some cases, where this arrangement has not given satisfaction, ferries are worked under direct Government supervision.

The principal waterway is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and flows into the sea at Addah, after a course of 200 miles. It is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse, and, with the exception of the Krachi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. The Ankobra River has been largely used for transport purposes to the mines in the Prestea and Himan Districts, and is navigable for many months of the year by surf-boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assinie, by the main lagoon, and by a tramway, three miles in length, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tanoso, a distance of about 60 miles. Rapids at Sutri prevent this river being further utilised.

The Government maintains a Motor Transport Service, consisting of 75 cars and lorries, including reserves, capable of instant expansion when necessary. At present it operates only in centres where vehicles provided by private enterprise are unobtainable or more costly than a Government owned fleet. The headquarters is at Accra, with branches at Sekondi, Coomassie, Koforidua and Ho. The department also handles Government cargo arriving by sea and arranges the coastwise shipping of Government personnel and stores between ports within the Colony.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails exchanged fortnightly between the Colony and other British Colonies on the West Coast and the United Kingdom are carried by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and of the African Steamer Ship Company. Mails are exchanged overland with the French mandated area of Togoland and with the French Ivory Coast.

There are 149 post and telegraph offices and postal agencies. The number of articles passed through the post in 1921 was 5,175,000. The number of parcels exported and imported in 1921 was 82,147. The distribution of mails to towns on the coast at which steamers do not call and to towns which are not situated on the railway lines is effected by runner and motor services.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Post Cards | Newspapers per 4 oz. or part thereof | Books, Commercial Papers, Printed matter |
|---------|------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Within the Colony | 1½d. each oz. or part thereof | 1d. | First oz. 1½d., second oz. 1d., every addl. oz. 1½d. |
| To the United Kingdom & certain British Colonies, United States of America and Egypt | do. | 1d. | |
| To other Countries | first oz. 1½d., each additional oz. 1½d. | 1¼d. | |

Parcel post despatches are exchanged direct with the United Kingdom and with the other British Colonies in West Africa. Parcels for other countries are forwarded through the United Kingdom.

British Imperial postal orders are issued and paid in the Colony, and both an Inland and a Foreign Money Order system is in operation.

A telegraph line extends along the Coast from the French mandated territory of Togoland to the Ivory Coast, establishing communication between the eighteen principal towns on the Coast. Inland a line runs north-easterly from Accra to Akuse and another runs along the Accra-Akwapim Railway to Anyinam. From Secondee a line runs to Coomassie, thence to Nkoranza, where it branches, one branch going via Tamale to Gambaga, one via Kintampo to Bole and Wa, and one via Sunyani to Wenehi.

In all there are 2,640 miles of telegraph line, exclusive of the lines used for railway purposes.

The rate charged for inland telegrams is 1s. for 12 words and 1d. per word in excess of 12.

The number of messages dealt with in 1921 was 468,964. Accra and Secondee are in telegraphic communication with Europe via Sierra Leone and Madeira, and to the South with Lagos, Bonny, the Cameroons and the Cape.

A coastal radiotelegraph station was erected at Accra in 1912. The rate for the transmission of radiotelegrams is 9d. per word.

There are telephone exchanges at Accra, Secondee, Tarquah and Koforidua, and trunk telephone lines connect Accra with the Post Offices at Winnebah, Nsawam, Mangoase, Koforidua, Aburi and Dodowa. Somanya is connected with Akuse, Saltpond with Ananabo, and Addah with Akuse, Quittah and Lome in the French mandated area of Togoland.

A considerable extension to the Telephone Trunk system is in progress, together with the provision of additional Telephone Exchanges.

**Education.**

Education in the Colony is chiefly in the hands of the Government and the following Missionary Societies:—The African Methodist Episcopal Zion, the Church of England (S.P.G.), the Roman Catholic, the Wesleyan and Scottish Missions.

The schools of the former Basel Mission which left the Colony in 1918 were under the control of Government until the early part of 1920, when they were taken over by the Scottish Mission; the Bremen Mission was closed down in 1916 and since that date all their schools have been directly under Government control.

There are twelve Government Primary Schools in the Colony, four in Ashanti and four in the Northern Territories making a total of twenty. There is also a military school at Coomassie and a police school at Accra, the former being controlled by the Education Department.

Of the Primary schools, seven are boys, three are girls, and ten are mixed schools. The total enrolment of these twenty schools is 4,510 (3,730 boys and 780 girls).

The staff of the Government Primary schools is entirely African, with the exception of the headmistress of the Government Girls School, Accra. Two African headmasters and one African headmistress have been appointed.

The mission schools are of two kinds, namely, assisted and non-assisted. The former receive grants from the Government, but the latter have not yet qualified for inspection, owing mainly to an insufficient average attendance. These are supported entirely by the missionary and local authorities.

Industrial instruction is given in most schools. This instruction is chiefly of an agricultural character, gardens being attached to most of the Mission Schools in the interior. Prizes are offered annually by the Government for the best school gardens.

Instruction in woodwork is given in the Government schools at Accra, Cape Coast and Coomassie, and, at a few mission schools, instruction is given in bookbinding, woodwork and weaving.

The number of Government and assisted schools inspected during the year 1921 was 234.

In the year 1921 there were in the Government and assisted schools 31,089 children on the roll, with an average attendance of 26,115, the corresponding figures for the previous year being 28,580 and 23,162 respectively. The number of children attending non-assisted schools cannot be given with absolute accuracy.

The following statement shows the number of Government and assisted schools with the numbers on the roll, average attendance, and amount of grant earned for 1921:

Expenses defrayed by Government.

Expenses defrayed by Government.
There are two institutions for the training of teachers, namely, the Scottish Mission Seminary at Akropong and the Government Training College at Accra. At the latter institution students are trained for all Government and assisted schools except those belonging to the Scottish Mission. The staff of the Accra Training College consists of the acting principal, one housemaster, three assistant masters and three African teachers. Accommodation is provided for 120 students and the course is for three years.

The Government Technical School in Accra was established in 1909. The staff consists of the Principal, housemaster, three European masters and four African instructors. This school is equipped for the teaching of:

(a) Metal-work (theoretical and practical), comprising fitting, motor engineering, blacksmith's work, and mechanical drawing;
(b) Wood-work (theoretical and practical), comprising carpentry, joinery, cabinet-making, polishing and mechanical drawing.

A limited number of pupils are taught masonry. The pupils at this school are paid apprentices and are under bond to complete the course of instruction at the school for three years and afterwards to serve in the Public Works Department for a period of two years, if required.

Four junior trade schools have now been established by Government at Kibbi in Eastern Akim, Assuntasi in the Cape Coast District, Mampong in Ashanti and Yendi in the Northern Territories. The staff in these schools consists of European headmasters and African instructors in literary subjects, carpentry, masonry and agriculture and metal work.

The only assisted secondary school in the Colony is the Church of England (S.P.G.) grammar school at Cape Coast. A Government secondary school is to be established at Achimota about six miles distant from Accra which it is hoped will be opened in 1925.

Currency and Banking.

Prior to 1912 and 1913 the currency consisted chiefly of British gold (comparatively rare), silver and copper. In 1912, subsidiary nickel-bronze coins (1d., ½d. and ¼d. pieces) were introduced, and in 1913 a special silver currency common to all the British West African Colonies of the same weight and fineness as the corresponding British coins. The coins so far issued are 2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d. pieces. Owing to the great increase in the demand for currency and the difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies, it was found necessary in 1915 to make British Treasury Notes of the denominations of 20s. and 10s. legal tender, and in 1916 special West African Currency Notes were introduced, the following values being now in circulation, viz.: ½s., 20s., 10s., 2s. and 1s., but the two last-mentioned values are now being withdrawn. In 1920, owing to the rapid disappearance of silver coins, an alloy coinage was introduced of the same denominations as the silver coins and silver is now being gradually withdrawn from circulation. The special West Africa silver and alloy currency and the West African Currency Notes are under the management of the West African Currency Board and are secured by sterling securities held by the Board. Current British gold and silver coins, British 20s. and 10s. Treasury Notes, West Africa Currency silver and alloy coins, West African Currency Notes, and West Africa nickel-bronze coins are all legal tender.

The Bank of British West Africa, Limited, opened at Accra on the 1st January, 1897, and now has branches at all the principal business centres in the Colony.

The Colonial Bank began business at Accra in 1917, and branches have now been opened at other centres. Both Banks have a savings department. In 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established which is now under Post Office management. On 31st March, 1922, the amount to the credit of depositors was 52,986/. Accounts are kept in sterling.

Population.

The first attempt to take a census was made in 1891 which, however, covered the Colony only. Since then a census has been made each decade, viz.:—1901, 1911 and 1921. Except in 1901, the whole of Ashanti and the Northern Territories have been included. In a country such as the Gold Coast, imperfect communications and lack of education make the holding of a complete census a matter of great difficulty and even now the figures cannot be considered absolutely accurate.

The resident population on census day, 1921, was as follows:

| Area               | Population |
|--------------------|------------|
| The Colony         | 1,173,439  |
| Ashanti            | 406,594    |
| Northern Territories| 530,391    |
| **Total**          | **2,110,424** |

Of this total, 1,967 were non-Africans, the majority being British. The population of the British sphere of Togoland was 187,969, of whom 20 were non-Africans. The grand total therefore for the area administered by the Gold Coast Government was 2,298,383. There was also a maritime population of 1,528 in the various harbours on census day.

The African population of the chief towns was as follows:

| Town       | Population |
|------------|------------|
| Accra      | 38,049     |
| Koforidua  | 5,364      |
| Nsawam     | 6,143      |
| Assamankese| 5,413      |
| Quittah    | 9,839      |
| Teshie     | 7,604      |
| Winnebah   | 6,980      |
| Saltpond   | 6,342      |
| Cape Coast | 14,921     |
| Chame      | 2,478      |
| Secondee   | 9,500      |
| Axim       | 3,781      |
| Obuassie   | 3,917      |
| Coomassie  | 20,268     |
| Mampong    | 2,288      |
| Tamale     | 3,901      |
| Gambaga    | 1,027      |

Trade and Industries.

The chief products of the Colony are cocoa and gold. Palm oil, palm kernels, lumber, and kola are also shipped.

The cultivation of cocoa was started in Akwapim in 1879, and exports in 1891 realised £1. Coffee at that time fetched a fair price, and it was not until 1898, when the price for the latter
article fell so low as to make its cultivation at any distance from the coast unremunerative, that attention was paid to cocoa. Since that year the cocoa industry has made rapid strides. In 1900 the value exported was £27,280, in 1918, £796,985, and in 1920, £10,066,298. In 1921, although the value fell considerably to £4,764,067, the quantity of cocoa exported exceeded the 1920 export by 8,422 tons. In 1922 159,306 tons, valued at £5,840,743, were exported.

Gold has been exported from the Gold Coast more or less continuously since the discovery of the country by Europeans in the fifteenth century. Up to 1874, however, the industry was almost entirely in the hands of the natives. The first company for gold mining in West Africa was founded in 1874, but did little beyond exploration. A second company, formed in 1879, engaged in mining operations in the neighbourhood of Tarquah, and from that year the progress of mining enterprise is indicated by the rapid increase in the exports of gold bars, the result of European operations, as compared with those of gold dust, the produce of native mining. In 1899 there was a very remarkable development of the mining industry, which, though checked for a while by the disturbances in Ashanti, received a fresh impetus from the passing of the Concessions Ordinance in 1900, the progress of the railway, and general improvement in means of transport.

Gold is widely diffused throughout the Colony, Ashanti, and some parts of the Northern Territories, in quartz and alluvial deposits, while in Wassaw there is good conglomerate or banket formation which is now reported to extend to the Birrim District in the Eastern Province. The rivers are said to be rich in alluvial deposits. From the year 1903 (the first in which reliable statistics of production were kept) to 1921, the gold produced in the colony and Ashanti amounted to 5,062,267 fine ozs., valued at £21,504,750. The highest annual production was in 1914, viz.:—410,655 fine ozs., valued at £1,744,498. In 1922 the value of gold and gold dust exported was £889,204. Bitumen is found along the banks of the river Bonni, in Apollonia and the stream Akyikyiri, flowing into the Ehi lagoon near Half Assinie. Manganese ore has been found near the railway line, 33 miles from Secondee, and this important ore is now being exported to England and America in considerable quantities. Extensive deposits of Bauxite exist, the most important being situated near Mpralo in the Kwahu district where a large quantity of high grade ore has been located. In the Winnebah district tin ore has been discovered and the deposit is being tested. In the same locality a silver lead vein has been located. In the Eastern Province near Kibbi diamonds have been found, and the alluvial is being worked. Small diamonds have also been found in other localities.

The exports of palm oil, which is used chiefly in the manufacture of soap and candles, has largely decreased of late owing to the competition of cocoa growing. The Volta River District is the most important centre for palm oil, on account of the facilities afforded by the river for transport to the coast. The oil is packed in casks, rolled to the river, towed by canoes to Akuse, and thence by launches to Addah for shipment to Europe. In other parts of the country the casks are rolled along the road to the nearest sea-port. The value of the palm oil exported in 1922 was £20,010, the average value for the previous ten years having been £65,067.

Great Britain now receives most of the palm kernels exported from the Gold Coast, in the stead of Germany, who before the war took about 75 per cent. of the kernels exported. The value of the palm kernels exported in 1922 was £46,449. The trade in kola nuts, which suffered greatly during the Ashanti disturbances, has since showed a steady increase. The tree is found principally in Ashanti and Akim, and the largest markets are at Bontuku (in French Territory), Kintampo, Salaga, and Kpong, whence the kola nut is conveyed by caravans to the Hausa States in the Hinterland. Returns are not available for the amount of kola exported by these routes. Good trees have been planted by the Agricultural Department, and increased attention is paid to its cultivation by the natives. The value of this product, exported by sea, amounted to £262,144 in 1918, £452,245, in 1920, and to £311,026 in 1922.

The export of rubber has decreased greatly during recent years. There are several reasons to account for this—viz., the low prices ruling in the European markets, the destruction of trees by unskilful tapping, rubber from the adjoining French Colonies no longer comes to Gold Coast ports, and a more profitable field for labour is offered by the cultivation of cocoa, and by the numerous mining enterprises, causes which have affected all staple products. In 1910 the value of the rubber exported was £383,876. In 1921 it was £6,742, and in 1922 it fell to £462. 1,500 trees have been planted by the Agricultural Department in forest land acquired by Government, and efforts are being made to instruct the natives in more scientific methods of tapping the trees and preparing the rubber for the market.

The values of the following exports for 1922 were:

| Export       | Value   |
|--------------|---------|
| Cocoa        | £5,840,743 |
| Kola Nuts    | £311,026  |
| Lumber       | £254,384  |
| Palm Kernels | £46,449   |
| Palm Oil     | £20,010   |
| Rubber       | £462      |

On 1st October, 1916, an export duty of one farthing a lb. was levied on cocoa. This was reduced, by an Order in Council of the 20th November, 1917, to one-fifth of a penny per lb. and increased, by an Ordinance passed on 4th July, 1919, to one-halfpenny per lb. In August, 1922, it was again reduced to one farthing per lb., with a view to allowing higher prices to be paid to the farmer for his cocoa.

The first in value of the imports in 1922 was cotton piece goods, followed by Railway Plant and rolling stock, but there is a steady demand for provisions, hardware, machinery, oils, motor spirits, flour, illuminating oils, building materials, cement and lime, soap, spirits and malt liquors. The use of motor transport is rapidly extending in the colony and 1920 showed a large import of motor cars and lorries; in 1921 the number imported was 294 and in 1922, 265.

Native manufactures are insignificant. Cloths are woven in many parts of the country, for the most part of English spun yarn, but in the northern districts occasionally of thread manufactured from the indigenous cotton plant. Narrow strips of four to six inches are woven on a rough hand loom, and stitched together to make...
ASHANTI.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwaias, Adanais, Kokofus, Nkwantas, Coomassies, Agunas, Mampons, Nautas, Kumawus, Bompatas, Juabins and Jiusu. Each tribe has its own Head Chief, but from time immemorial the King of Coomassie was recognised as the King paramount of the Confederation.

In 1873 the King of Ashanti invaded the British Protectorate with a large army, and reached Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the British forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing. Later in the year Captain (afterwards Sir) John Glover was sent to the eastern districts of the Protectorate to organise the tribes in that quarter, for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, (afterwards Viscount) Wolseley was despatched to the Gold Coast, with British and West Indian troops, native levies, and some seamen and marines, to operate against the Ashantis, starting from Cape Coast. On the 31st of January, 1874, he came into general engagement with the enemy at Amofoal, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Coomassie. The King had fled to the bush. A few days later Sir John Glover also reached Coomassie. On the 13th, messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommannah, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fommannah, the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold.

In 1894 Prempeh, who was then King of Coomassie, and had successfully fought against the Nkoranza, who had revolted against his rule, threatened to attack the Atabubus. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Coomassie. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and a military expedition accordingly proceeded to Coomassie, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Coomassie without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmina Castle. A Resident was at the same time installed at Coomassie, and thus commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

In 1900 the Governor visited Coomassie, and was there besieged by the Ashantis, the town being closely invested. Provisions ran short, and a part of the garrison, with the Governor, cut their way out; the rest were relieved by Colonel (afterwards Sir J.) Willcocks, commanding the Ashanti Field Force, on 15th July, after severe fighting. The Ashantis were subsequently thoroughly routed at Obassa.

An Order of the King in Council, dated September 26th, 1901, defined the boundaries of Ashanti, annexed it to His Majesty's Dominions, and provided for its administration under the Governor of the Gold Coast. Ashanti is under a Chief Commissioner, with Commissioners of Provinces and Districts under him. By a subsequent Order in Council of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Colony and Ashanti, and between Ashanti and the Northern Territories, were re-adjusted and defined, with due regard to tribal lands and natural features.

Ashanti is now divided into two provinces, the Eastern with headquarters at Coomassie and the Western with headquarters at Sunyani. Each of these is subdivided into districts under a District Commissioner who exercises limited jurisdiction.

In 1919 a Circuit Judge was appointed for Ashanti. This officer relieves the Chief Commissioner of practically all judicial work except civil cases and matters in which native customary law is applicable.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES.

In 1897 the territories to the north of Ashanti were constituted a separate district with the title of "The Northern Territories," and placed in charge of a Commissioner, and a grant-in-aid of the expenditure in the Northern Territories was voted by Parliament.

Major H. P. Northcott was appointed Commissioner and Commandant of these territories, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The negotiations between the British and French Governments for the settlement of territorial questions in West Africa, which had been suspended in 1896, were resumed in October, 1897; and on 14th June, 1898, after a period of considerable tension in consequence of the proximity of the British and French forces in the disputed territories, a Convention was signed at Paris with a proviso that it should be ratified within six (subsequently extended to twelve) months. By this Convention the boundary between the Gold Coast and the French Colony of the Ivory Coast, which had only been settled in 1889, as far as the 9th parallel of north latitude, was continued northwards along the course of the Black Volta River to the 11th parallel, and it was then drawn along the 11th parallel with a defection to the north in the neighbourhood of Mamprusi, until it met the Franco-German boundary of 1897. The effect of the Anglo-French Convention of 14th June, 1898, was to leave Bona, Lobi, and Moshi to France, while Dagati, Wa, Mamprusi, and the southern portion of Gurunshi were included in the British sphere.

On 14th November, 1899, an agreement was concluded with Germany for the partition of the "neutral zone." This partition assigned Salaga to Great Britain, and Yendi to Germany, and to the north of the zone gave Mamprusi to the former and Chakosi to the latter.
Survey operations were undertaken by Anglo-French and Anglo-German Commissions during 1901-2, for the delimitation of those portions of the boundaries which had not yet been settled.

By the demarcation on the ground of the Anglo-German boundary between the Trans-Volta District and the adjoining Colony of Togo; of the Anglo-German boundary north of the 9th parallel of north latitude; and of the Anglo-French boundary along the 11th parallel of north latitude, all the frontiers of the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories have now been exactly defined.

Provision was made for the administration of the Northern Territories under the Gold Coast Government by an Order of the King in Council of 26th September, 1901, and by an Administrative Ordinance of January 1st, 1902, the Northern Territories were placed under a Chief Commissioner, and divided into the White Volta, Black Volta, Kintampo and Gonja Districts with headquarters at Gambaga, Wa, Kintampo and Salaga. By proclamation of 27th June, 1921, the country was re-divided as follows:

Northern Province consisting of the districts of Northern Mamprussi, Southern Mamprussi, Lorha Tumua and Wa.

Southern Province consisting of the districts of Eastern and Western Dagomba and Eastern and Western Gonja.

The Districts are presided over by Commissioners, who are responsible to the Chief Commissioner and have Courts of Justice, with appeal to the Chief Commissioner at Tamale.

By Order in Council, of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Northern Territories and Ashanti were re-adjusted and defined.

An important step was taken with regard to the Government of this Protectorate by replacing, with effect from the 1st of January, 1907, the former semi-military administration by a staff of Civil District and Assistant District Commissioners, and by establishing new stations. Simultaneously, the 2nd Battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment has been disbanded and a force of armed constabulary substituted therefor.

In 1920 the Circuit Judge, Ashanti, was appointed to exercise in the Northern Territories powers similar to those which he exercises in Ashanti.

TOGOLAND.

The former German colony of Togoland is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, bounded on the east by the Dahomey and on the west by the Gold Coast and its Protectorates. The actual coast-line lies between 1° 45' and 1° 14' W. longitude, the frontiers, however, especially on the west, opening out considerably. The total area is about 36,500 square miles.

Until 1894-86 the majority of the tribes along the littoral and its immediate hinterland, also those adjoining the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast regarded themselves as being under the suzerainty of Great Britain, but by agreements made with the French on the 24th December, 1885, and with the British on the 14th and 28th July, 1886, when provisional frontiers were fixed, German influence was formally recognized by those Powers. Subsequent agreements dated the 23rd July, 1897, and the 14th November, 1899, between Germany and the Governments of France and Great Britain respectively defined the northern frontiers of Togoland.

Immediately upon the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany Togoland was invaded by the Gold Coast forces. On the 6th August, 1914, Captain E. B. Barker entered the capital, Lome, under a flag of truce and on the following day that town and the hinterland for a distance of 120 kilometers from the sea were surrendered. On the 8th August Anecho (Petit Popo) was occupied by the French. Operations on a larger scale commenced on the 11th August when Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel F. C. Bryant landed at Lome. After engagements at Agbelufoe and Chra River on the 16th and 24th August respectively the enemy retired on the great wireless station at Kamina, which they destroyed. On the 26th August the acting-governor surrendered the Colony unconditionally.

Pour parlers then took place between Sir Hugh Clifford, governor of the Gold Coast, and M. Noufflard, governor of Dahomey, as the result of which an agreement, subsequently ratified by the governments concerned was drawn up. Under this agreement Togoland was provisionally divided into British and French spheres. To the British were allotted the western administrative areas of Lome and Lomeland, Misahoe, Kete-Kratchi and Yendi, and to the French Anecho, Atakpame, Sokode and Sansamme Mangu.

By proclamation dated the 30th September, 1914, civil courts were established under the presidency of political officers seconded from the Gold Coast, appeal lying from the district courts to that of a senior political officer. In the absence of a local criminal code, that of the Gold Coast was introduced as a basis of procedure.

In June, 1915, the office of senior political officer was merged in that of the senior military commander, without prejudice, however, to the civil nature of the court concerned.

Boundary adjustments with the French took place in 1920 in accordance with an agreement signed by Lord Milner and M. Simon on 10th July, 1919. Lome and the whole of the coast were given over to the French, and the British received additional territory in the interior. The area of the British sphere is 13,040 square miles.

In October, 1921, the Council of the League of Nations approved in principle the arrangements made between the British and French Governments for the division Togoland in accordance with the agreement of 10th July, 1919, and the application to the territories of the Mandate system; and on 20th July, 1922, after a delay due to negotiations between the United States Government and the Mandatory Powers, the Council confirmed the mandates and defined their terms.* The British sphere is divided into three districts with headquarters at Ho, Kete Kratchi and Yendi, administered by District Political Officers under the direction of the Governments of the Gold Coast Colony, and the Northern Territories respectively.

The road system of the Germans which was based on their railway system (now entirely confined within the limits of the French sphere) is not of direct commercial value. It is hoped to remedy this state of affairs by the construction of a main trade route from the river Volta near Kpong to Ho in Togoland, the western boundary of British Togoland being regarded as the Gold Coast frontier for the purpose of collection of Customs duties.
