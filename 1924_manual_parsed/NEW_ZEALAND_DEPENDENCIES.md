DEPENDENCIES OF NEW ZEALAND.*

COOK ISLANDS.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Dominion. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Ariakis, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of

these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

The islands became part of the Dominion of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The administration and laws were continued in force subject to the provisions of the Cook Islands Government Act, passed in that year.

In 1915 an Act was passed by the New Zealand Parliament consolidating the laws relating to the Cook Islands and Niue Island, and providing for the appointment of a member of the Executive Council of New Zealand as the Minister for the Cook Islands, who is charged with the administration of the government of the Islands.

The Act also makes provision for the constitution of Island Councils; for the establishment of public schools, Courts of Justice, Native Land Court, etc.

The population of the Cook Islands on 30th June, 1923, was estimated at 9,695.

Minister for the Cook Islands, Hon. Sir Maui Pomare, K.B.E., C.M.G.

Secretary, Cook Islands Department, Wellington, J. D. Gray.

Resident Commissioner at Rarotonga, H. F. Ayson.

**RAROTONGA.**

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 26 square miles; population, 3,503, census, 1921.

Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with a remarkably rich and productive soil.

The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner is situated here.

The total value of exports from the Cook islands for 1922 was £135,802l., of which £102,906l. represented trade with New Zealand. The principal items were: fresh fruit, £83,159l.; tomatoes, £17,417l.; copra and coconuts, £33,982l.

Revenue and expenditure of the Cook and Northern Islands for the year 1922-23; Revenue, £21,923l.; expenditure, £19,119l.

**MANGAIA.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 110 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,230.

Physical Features.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga.

Coconuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully.

Resident Agent, T. Duncan.

**ATIU.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 22 square miles; population, 837.

Resident Agent, J. Dyer.

The Island.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge coconuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumera, one of the most valuable of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The coconut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation.

**MAUKE.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 151 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 678.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and produce of considerable value and quantity is exported.

Resident Agent, J. C. Cameron.

**MITIABO.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 142 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 6 square miles; population, 207.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Resident Agent, Tou Ariki.

**TAKUTEA.**

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area, ¾ square mile.

This island was presented to the Crown by the Ariki of Atiu to whom it belonged. It is a coral island, moderately fertile.

**AITUTAKI.**

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 460 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 1,373.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Ara-ura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 460 feet high.

Copra is the chief production, and some of the best oranges and pineapples on the market are grown here.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious when away from their own homes. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group, and their services are much in demand for working the cargo on vessels at Tahiti. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

Resident Agent, A. A. Luckham.
MANUAU AND TE AU-O-TU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 128 miles; area of Manuae, 24 square miles.

These two small islands are better known as the Hervey Group. They are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

The islands have been leased to Messrs. Bates and Gruning.

NIUE.

Distant from Auckland, 1,343 miles, and from Rarotonga, 590 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 3,750; census, 1921. The only regular communication with Niue is by steamer connection from Auckland—about six trips each year being made.

Niue, or Savage Island, was placed under a separate administration by an Amending Act of 1903. It is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coastline is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the coconut, the banana, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores. Recent experiments in cotton growing have been most successful and the product highly reported upon by the British Cotton Growing Association.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are much averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1922 amounted to 15,122£., and the imports to 15,418£. The revenue for 1922-23 was 7,428£., and the expenditure 6,453£. The principal exports were copra, 1,134£.; hats, 3,088£.; fungus, 93£.; basketware, 143£.

Resident Commissioner, G. N. Morris.

PALMERSTON ATOLL.

Distant from Rarotonga, 277 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 83; census, 1921.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with coconut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Marsters.

PENRHYN.

Distant 740 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 376.

This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Tongareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling pearlshell diving have been made.

The coconut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce, and large concrete tanks have been built by the Administration in the various villages for storage of rain water.

Resident Agent, W. Wilson.

SUWARROW.

Distant from Rarotonga, 526 miles; area, ½ square mile.

Suwarrow is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell. Part of the anchorage has been gazetted as a naval reserve. The remainder of the Island is leased to Capt. Harries, of Rarotonga.

MANIHIKI AND RAKAHANGA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 432; Rakahanga, 310.

Manihiki, or Humphrey, is nearly circular. Béche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought and similar tanks to those at Penrhyn have been erected.

Rakahanga, or Rierson, is also an atoll.

The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by over-fishing. The Manihiki lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling diving made as in the case at Penrhyn.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

PUKAPUKA, OR DANGER ISLAND.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is 720 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 530 persons.

NASSAU.

This small island has an area of about 360 acres, of which 300 acres are under cultivation with coconuts. It lies a few miles distant from Pukapuka. The plantation belongs to the Samoa Shipping and Trading Co., Ltd., of Sydney. There is no indigenous population. The present residents consist of labourers, introduced by the Company to work the plantation.

Education.

The control of education in the Cook Islands has, by the Cook Islands Act, 1915, been placed under the Minister for the Cook Islands. Four schools have been established in Rarotonga. Schools have also been established at Aitutaki, Mauke, Palmerston, Mangaia, and Atiu. The instruction given is similar to that of the New Zealand State Schools. Technical instruction is being made a special feature.

At Niue Island there are two schools conducted on the same lines.

Trade of Cook Islands.

Oranges, bananas and copra are the chief exports and trade is developing satisfactorily. Tomatoes are being grown with success and being sent to New Zealand in Winter and Spring.

The Wellington-San Francisco mail steamer makes 4 weekly calls (North and South Bound) at Rarotonga, and during the fruit season (April to September) regular monthly visits are paid by cargo steamer from Auckland to Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mangaia and Mauke.

There is a radio station at Rarotonga and arrangements are being made for the erection of a radio station at Aitutaki.

THE ROSS DEPENDENCY.

By order in Council of 30th July, 1923, the government of the coasts of the Ross Sea and of adjacent islands and territories was transferred to the Governor-General of New Zealand. There are no permanent inhabitants of the territory, but whaling is carried on by a Norwegian firm under licence.

WESTERN SAMOA.

The Territory of Western Samoa, formerly in the possession of Germany, was seized and occupied by New Zealand Troops on behalf of the Imperial Government on the 29th August, 1914. It remained in military occupation during the war, and was surrendered by Germany under the Treaty of Peace to the Allied and Associated Powers, by whom the mandate to govern the ex-German territory was assigned to the Dominion of New Zealand. The mandate was issued by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920.

On the 1st May, 1920, by Orders passed by the Governor-General of New Zealand in Council, provision was made for the Civil Administration of the Territory; and by the Samoa Act, 1921, of New Zealand, the constitution and legal system of the territory were settled.

Western Samoa is administered by an Administrator appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand and responsible to the Minister of External Affairs (a member of the N.Z. Executive Council who is charged with the Government of the territory). There is a Legislative Council consisting of not less than four official members appointed by the Governor-General and of three elected members, chosen by the votes of European population. The Administrator, acting with the advice and consent of this Council, is empowered to make Ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, subject to disallowance by the Governor-General. A High Court is established, and the Supreme Court of New Zealand is given jurisdiction over Western Samoa.

The Samoan natives are to a large extent granted domestic self-government.

The Faipule (Native Parliament, leading chiefs representing every district) who are appointed by the Administrator, meet twice yearly and draft native orders for submission to the Government.

Minister for External Affairs at Wellington, Hon. Sir Francis Bell, G.C.M.G., K.C.

Secretary for External Affairs at Wellington, J. D. Gray.

Administrator of Samoa, Major-General G. S. Richardson, C.B., C.M.C., C.B.E.

Secretary Samoa Administration, Colonel J. W. Hutchen, C.M.G.

The Territory consists of the Islands of Upolu, Savaii, Apolima and Manono, together with several small islets lying between the 13th and 15th degree S. Lat., and 171st and 173rd degrees West Long., situated some 130 miles North of Tonga and 450 miles N.E. of Fiji. The sailing distance from Auckland (N.Z.) is 1,560 miles, from Sydney 2,570 miles, and from San Francisco 4,400 miles.

The total area of Western Samoa is 725,000 acres. 138,500 acres are alienated, of which (apart from native cultivation) 18,400 acres are under cultivation. The main products for 1922 were copra, 16,956 tons (of which three quarters was produced by the Natives), and cocoa, 765 tons, all European produced.

There is a four-weekly steamer between Auckland and Apia, which connects en route with the Sydney service at Suva (Fiji), and also a four-weekly connection at Pago Pago (American Samoa), with the San Francisco-Sydney mail steamer.

A radio station situated at Apia works directly with New Zealand and Honolulu, and is also the transmitting station for the stations at Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga, Tahiti and Pago Pago.

Postal and Banking.—New Zealand postage rates apply in the Territory. A Government Money Order and Savings Bank Office and a Branch of the Bank of New Zealand are in operation at Apia. British currency is in circulation.

Population.—For 16 years prior to 30th September, 1918, the Native births exceeded the deaths by 5,487. In October, 1918, influenza in a virulent
form visited the Islands and carried off 20 per cent. of the native population, but since then the native births have exceeded the deaths by 2,657.

Census of 17th April, 1921.

Total: 37,157

The estimated population of Western Samoa at the 30th June, 1923, was 38,100.

Education.—As a result of Missionary effort practically every Samoan can read and write his own language. Government Schools are maintained at Apia (Upolu) and Vaipouli (Savaii).

Medical Services.—A Government Hospital is maintained at Apia, with a staff of European doctors and nurses, and a district hospital has been established at Tuasiwi (Savaii). Dangerous fevers and reptiles are unknown.

Roads and Locomotion.—Roads radiate from Apia chiefly following the coast line. Motor traffic is rapidly developing both on land and on water. The coral lagoons form natural highways around many parts of the Islands.

Climate.—The climate is tropical and very equable. The wet season extends from December to March, the remainder of the year being pleasant with trade winds blowing.
