PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the French sphere of Syria and Lebanon, on the west by the Mediterranean, and on the south by Egyptian and Hejaz territory, the boundary running from just west of Rafa on the Mediterranean to just east of Taba at the end of the Gulf of Akaba, and then north-east. On the east, the boundary is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of the town of Akaba in the Gulf of Akaba up the centre of the Wady Araba, the Dead Sea and the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmuk, thence up the centre of the River Yarmuk to the Syrian frontier.

The boundary on the north was settled by the Anglo-French Convention of 23rd December, 1920. From the Mediterranean Sea, just south of Ras-el-Nakura, and about half way between Tyre and Acre, it runs eastwards and northwards to Metulla (British), and across the Upper Jordan Valley to Banias (French). It then runs south-eastwards to Skek, and thence down the rivers Jeraba and Massadiye to the north-eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias and across the Lake to Samakh at its southern extremity.

The detailed delimitation is set out in a Parliamentary Paper (Cmd. 1910), published in 1923.

Palestine comprises four zones of country. On the west, along the shores of the Mediterranean, which are desolate here in good natural harbours, is a low plain, which varies from 15 to 20 miles in width at Gaza to about two miles at Acre, but which, at one place, the plain of Esdraelon, stretches for a considerable distance into the interior, and separates the high lands of Galilee from those of Samaria and Judea. From the coastal plain, the country rises into a plateau, intersected by deep valleys, which drops steeply to the east to the third zone, which is formed by the great depression down which the River Jordan runs to the Dead Sea, and which is prolonged for another 100 miles to the Red Sea as the Wadi Araba. This depression reaches a depth below sea level of 2,600 feet in the deepest portion of the Dead Sea, the surface of which is about 1,300 feet below sea level, and which is 46 miles long with an average breadth of 8½ miles. East of the Jordan valley the country rises again, and merges into the Syrian desert.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude; the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated hilly zone is drier and more temperate; the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight; while, further east still, the neighbourhood of the desert makes its effect marked on both the temperature and the rainfall. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are the wettest months, and the main rainfall occurs between November and April.

Water for domestic use is obtained in towns mostly from rock-cut cisterns in which rain water is collected, and in rural districts also from wells. Jerusalem has a piped water supply, pumped from a spring about 10 miles south of the town by an installation made by the Military Authorities soon after its occupation, and from Solomon's Pools, near Bethlehem, by an installation made by the Civil Administration.

Considerable progress has been made towards the eradication of malaria, formerly so prevalent, by Government distribution of quinine in villages, oiling of wells and cisterns, and drainage of swamps. The Government is assisted in anti-malarial work by research and survey units attached to the Department of Health by the Joint Distribution Committee of America and the Rockefeller Institute of America.

The country is relatively free from epidemic disease.

Government.

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet of Beirut and part in the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British Forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July 1st, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

By the Treaty of Peace, concluded at Lausanne in 1923, Turkey renounced her sovereignty over Palestine. The administration of the country was entrusted to a Mandatory to be selected by the Principal Allied Powers. The Supreme Council had already selected His Britannic Majesty as Mandatory at San Remo on 25th April, 1920. The Mandatory is responsible for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, viz.: "His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

The terms of the Mandate for Palestine were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th July, 1922, and the Mandate came into force on September 29th, 1923.

Constitution.

On 1st September, 1922, a new constitution was promulgated to replace the existing arrangements. It provides for the appointment of a High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief and an Executive Council.

Under this constitution a Legislative Council will have authority to pass such Ordinances as may be necessary for the peace, order and good government of Palestine, provided (1) that no Ordinance shall restrict complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship, save in so far as is required for the maintenance of public order and morals, or shall tend to discriminate in any way between the inhabitants of Palestine on the ground of race, religion or language; (2) that no Ordinance shall take effect until either the High Commissioner or His Majesty has assented thereto; (3) that the High Commissioner may reserve any Ordinance for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure, and shall so reserve any Ordinance which concerns matters dealt with specifically by the provisions of the Mandate, and (4) that His Majesty may disallow any Ordinance to which the High Commissioner may have assented within one year of the date of the High Commissioner's assent.

The Legislative Council will consist, in addition to the High Commissioner, of 22 members, of whom 10 will be official members and 12 unofficial members. All the unofficial members will be elected, not less than two of them being Christians and two Jews, and the rest Moslems.

The elected members are to be chosen by primary and secondary elections. Every male Palestinian citizen over 25 years of age is entitled to vote.
at the primary election, unless he has lost his civil rights or claims to be a foreign subject, or under foreign protection, or is otherwise disqualified. The number of secondary electors to be elected in each electoral area is determined on the basis that every 200 primary electors elect one secondary elector. If any village or quarter has between 150 and 200 primary electors, it is entitled to vote for one secondary elector; if it has between 350 and 400 primary electors it is entitled to vote for two secondary electors, and so on.

Any person may be elected as a secondary elector provided he is on the register of primary electors for the district.

The secondary electors are then formed into twelve electoral colleges according to the religious community to which they belong; the number of colleges to be allotted to each religious community being proportioned to the number of secondary electors belonging to the several communities; and each electoral college elects one member of the Council.

No Legislative Council has yet been elected; and, in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as the Legislative Council can be elected according to the provisions of the Constitution, the High Commissioner has formed an official Advisory Council. Its members are the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Inspector-General of Police and Prisons, District Governor Jerusalem-Jaffa District, Director of Agriculture, Director of Customs and Trade, Director of Education, Director of Health, and Director of Public Works.

Power to constitute this Council is given to the High Commissioner under the Palestine (Amendment) Order in Council, 1923.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

The Jewish population of Palestine have perfected their internal organisation by convening an elected Assembly, which elected a National Committee, to represent the Jewish population of Palestine in its dealings with the Administration.

The British Government and Palestine Administration recognise the World Zionist Organisation, which in Palestine is represented by the Palestine Zionist Executive, as the Agency of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home.

The Supreme Moslem Sharia Council was constituted by order of the High Commissioner in December, 1921, to control and manage Moslem Awqaf and affairs in Palestine; it consists of a President (Rais-ul-Ulema), and four members elected by secondary electors, who again are elected by the inhabitants of the Liwa of Jerusalem (two members) and the Liwas of Nablus and Acre. It nominates, for approval by Government, the officers of the Sharia Courts, and controls the appointments and dismissals of Sharia and Waqf officers. It has established an orphanage in Jerusalem and a technical office to deal with the repair of sacred buildings, and has carried out extensive tree planting on Waqf land and in Moslem cemeteries.

Palestine, east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea, known as Transjordan, is controlled by a separate administration under the supervision of the High Commissioner for Palestine.

Special provision is made for the government of this territory, to which certain Articles of the Mandate have been declared by the Council of the League of Nations to be inapplicable. A local Arab Administration has been formed under His Highness the Emir Abdullah ibn Husain, G.B.E. (son of King Husain of the Hejaz and brother of King Faisal of Iraq) assisted by a staff of Arab Advisers. The High Commissioner for Palestine is represented in Transjordan by the Chief British Representative. The official language is Arabic.

The eastern and southern boundaries of Transjordan are yet to be defined.

Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into four districts, administered by District Governors: Jerusalem-Jaffa, Northern, Samaria and Southern District.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is about 9,000 square miles in extent, and includes only that part of historic Palestine which lies to the west of the Jordan. The population of this territory taken by census on October 23rd, 1922, was 757,182, of which number one-third is located in 22 small towns and large villages.

There were then 590,890 Moslems, 83,794 Jews, 73,024 Christians, some 7,028 Druzes, and 163 Samaritans, 265 Bahais, and the remainder Sikhs, Hindus and Metawileh.

The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population at the date of the 1922 census was 62,678. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham.

Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The census population figures for the other principal towns are: Jaffa, 47,709; Haifa, 24,634; Gaza, 17,480; Nazareth, 7,424; Nablus, 15,947; Safad, 8,761; Tiberias, 6,960; Hebron, 16,577; Ramleh, 7,312; Bethlehem, 6,658; Lydda, 8,103; Acre, 6,420.

The Jewish Colonies are grouped in four districts as follows: in Jerusalem-Jaffa District, 26; in Samaria, 17; in Lower Galilee, 27; in Upper Galilee, 10.

The total population of these settlements is now about 18,000. More than twenty of them belong to the Jewish National Fund, which was established by the Zionist Organization for the purpose of acquiring land to remain the national property of the Jewish people. The Palestine Land Development Company, also organised by the Zionist Organization, owns Kalandia, and some lands on the Carmel, on the Kishon, at Jaffa, Jerusalem, etc. The other colonies were founded mostly by Baron Edmond de Rothschild. The total area of the Jewish Settlements is 652,663 dunoms (43 dunoms equals 1 acre).

The local affairs of the smaller Jewish Colonies are controlled by Vaads or Councils elected by the male and female residents who own registered holdings or pay taxes.

The larger villages, Arab and Jewish, are, for internal order and rates, administered by Local Councils, constituted under Ordinance, which exercise modified municipal powers.
Instruction.

The approximate number of children between the ages of 5 and 16 years in Palestine is as follows:—Moslem, 120,000; Jews, 17,000; Christian, 15,000. The schools maintained by the Government number 314, and contain 19,331 scholars; the great majority of the pupils are Moslems. The extension of village education undertaken by the Government is being carried out, and 193 new schools have been opened since October, 1920. The Training Colleges for Teachers have been extended and the number of men students increased to 80 and of women to 56. Technical education is being carried out systematically in the villages and in some of the towns. A Law School exists in Jerusalem, in which lectures are given in the three official languages by Judges and Government officers learned in law and by practising advocates.

The Christian and Jewish Communities provide, the former to a very large extent, and the latter almost entirely, for the education of their own children.

The Zionist Organization, through the Department of Education attached to the Palestine Zionist Executive, controls 118 educational institutions in Palestine, with a staff of 497 teachers, and attended by about 12,000 pupils. These institutions include Gymnasia at Jerusalem and Jaffa, Teachers' Training Colleges (General, Orthodox, Women's and Kindergarten), Schools of Music in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, an Agricultural School, an Arts and Crafts Institute (Bezalel), Commercial Evening Classes, and a Technical College. The Christian schools maintained by various religious bodies number about 168, including one secondary school and one higher college; some 13,500 pupils are on their rolls.

There are also about 33 private Moslem elementary schools, mainly maintained by local committees; these provide for about 2,400 children, and in three there are secondary sections. Most non-government schools receive a capitation grant-in-aid from the Department of Education, conditional on the acceptance of a certain measure of Government supervision and inspection; in 1923 the grant amounted to £E.20 per pupil.

Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are either civil or religious courts. The former have jurisdiction over local subjects in all matters save those of personal status and charitable endowments, and over foreign subjects in all matters, subject to the provisions mentioned below.

Civil Courts.

There is a Magistrate's Court in every sub-district and, in the three larger towns, Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, two such courts. The Magistrate is in every case a Palestinian and has jurisdiction in first instance in minor criminal offences for which the punishment is not more than one year's imprisonment, and in civil cases where the value of the subject matter does not exceed £E. 100. He has also jurisdiction in actions for the recovery of the possession of land.

There are four District Courts, each composed of a British President and two Palestinian members. They serve respectively the Jerusalem division and the sub-districts of Hebron and Beersheba, the sub-districts of Jaffa and Gaza, the Northern District and Samaria; and go on circuit within the area of their jurisdiction. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance in all crimes other than those punishable with death and civil cases not within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate, and also hears appeals from the decisions of Magistrates both in civil and in criminal cases, except in cases for the recovery of the possession of land. Crimes punishable with death are tried by a Court of Criminal Assize composed of the Chief Justice or a British Judge of the Supreme Court sitting with the District Court.

The Constitution provides for the establishment of a Supreme Court which will sit either in the form of a Court of Appeal or as a High Court. The Courts Ordinance to give effect to this provision has been approved by the Advisory Council and promulgated.

The Court of Appeal is composed of a British Chief Justice, a British Senior Member and four Palestinian members. A division of this court normally consists of the Chief Justice or the British Senior Member and two Palestinian members. It has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided in first instance by the District Courts, and in actions for the recovery of the possession of land decided by Magistrates. It also hears appeals from the Land Courts.

The High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine such matters as are not causes or trials, but petitions or applications not within the jurisdiction of any other Court and necessary to be decided for the administration of justice.

A bench of honorary magistrates has been established in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Acre and Gaza, who try contraventions for which the maximum penalty does not exceed £E. 5 fine and 15 days' imprisonment.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba sub-district, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs. A British Judge visits Beersheba to hear appeals from the local courts and to try more serious criminal cases.

Two special Land Courts have been established to deal with suits in which the ownership of land is in issue. The courts are composed of a British President and a Palestinian Judge. In the Samaria and Northern Districts, the District Court deals with land cases as well as with other civil actions.

The Palestine Order-in-Council contains special rules for the trial of foreigners who are defined as "any person who is a national or subject of a European or American State or Japan," excluding Ottoman subjects, and inhabitants of a territory protected by, or administered under a Mandate granted to, a European State.

The rules provide that a foreigner accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding 15 days may claim to be tried by a British Magistrate, and a foreigner accused of an offence not triable by a Magistrate may claim that the investigation shall be undertaken by a British Magistrate and that at the trial the Court shall contain a majority of British judges. In civil cases tried by the District Court a foreigner may claim that at least one member of the Court shall be a British judge, and in appeals heard by the Supreme Court, that the Court shall contain a majority of British judges.

Matters of personal status affecting foreigners, other than Moslems, are decided by the District Courts which apply the Personal Law of the parties concerned, that is the law of the nationality of the foreigner unless that law imports the law of his domicile. The District Court, in trying
such matters, is constituted by the British President sitting alone, who may, however, call in a Consul or representative of the Consulate to sit as an assessor for the purpose of advising him upon the Personal Law.

The official languages of the Courts are English, Arabic and Hebrew.

Religious Courts.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Kadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moslem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish Religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Jews, and jurisdiction by consent in other matters. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish Religious Courts lies to the Rabbinical Council.

The Christian religious communities (such as the Latin and Orthodox) retain the courts which they possessed in the Turkish regime; the jurisdiction of these courts is similar to that of the Jewish Religious Courts.

Production and Industry.

Although economic conditions are still primitive, modern methods are making headway and hold out hopes of development and progress. The country is generally fertile, and cereals, wine, olives and various fruits are produced, while sheep and goats thrive both in the lowlands and in the mountains.

For the most part the crops are raised without irrigation, except where springs exist, and on the banks of the Auja, in the district of Jaffa. There are generally two cereal crops each year, harvested in May and September.

For the area under British Administration, exclusive of Transjordan, the following are the figures of cereal and fruit production, 1922-23:

| Crop       | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Wheat      | 79,798 Tons |
| Barley     | 32,079    |
| Millet (Durrah) | 21,566   |
| Olives     | 14,000    |
| Lentils    | 3,908     |
| Grapes     | 6,556     |
| Melons     | 16,730    |
| Oranges    | 757,746 Boxes |

Limestone is found all over the country; sandstone abounds on the coast; gypsum of good quality is found at Mount Gipsia near Menahemia (Galilee). Rock salt abounds in the Jordan Valley and on the shores of the Dead Sea, where sulphur is also obtainable. Mineral oil is said to be found, but work has not yet commenced. The Dead Sea contains cooking salt, carnallite, and bromide. There are medicinal hot springs in the Jordan Valley, the most important being at Tiberias.

The only industries of export importance are those of wine-making, especially in the Jewish Colonies, Zichron-Jacob, Rishon-le-Zion, and Petah-Tikva; soap-boiling in Nablus and Haifa; olive oil in Nablus, Acre, and the district round Jaffa.

Oranges, grown chiefly in the Jaffa District, are exported to Egypt and Europe, the total quantity exported during the 1922-23 season being valued at £E. 374,798.

A Woods and Forests Ordinance has been promulgated and also various Forestry Regulations, supplementary to the Ordinance, for the protection, management and control of existing forests. The country had been terribly deforested during the Ottoman regime.

Eight Government nurseries are conducted for the raising of forest trees and fruit stock. Planting, commenced in 1920 at each centre where nurseries exist, is being considerably extended. Special attention is being given to the reclamation of sand dunes and the planting of roadsides.

Manufactures.

There are a considerable number of small factories and industries, including flour mills, soap, brick and tile, and cigarette factories, oil mills and distilleries. One flour mill produces 1,500 tons of flour monthly. There is a brick factory with an annual output of 15,000,000 bricks and tiles, a cigarette factory producing annually one hundred million cigarettes, and an oil factory with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons of refined oil. A cement factory capable of producing 30,000 tons annually is now under construction.

An important recent construction is that of an electric power plant which supplies light and power in the Jaffa district.

Shipping and Communications.

The chief ports of Palestine are Jaffa and Haifa. There is a small haven at Acre, and coasting vessels touch at Gaza and Caesarea.

In the year ending March 31st, 1923, 405 steamers of 998,043 tons (including men-of-war), and 1,227 sailing vessels of 26,489 tons arrived at Palestinian Ports; and for the half-year ending September 30th, 1923, 294 steamers of 553,949 tons and 1,484 sailing vessels of 24,102 tons.

Eighteen Shipping Lines call, of which the following run regular services: Khedivial, Lloyd Triestino, Servizi Maritimi, and Affréters Réunis, weekly; Messageries Maritimes, Fabre Line, Dutch Oriental, Dutch Levant, and Maritimi Italiani, twice monthly; and the Prince Line, monthly.

Calls are made at irregular intervals by the Compagnie Russe de Navigation, Moss & Ellerman Line, Greek Line, Dutch Lines & Co., Kerr Line.

The total length of the Palestine Railways, which are State-owned, is approximately 1,000 kilometres, including branch lines and sidings, subdivided in the following sections:

| Kilometres |
|-----------|
| Stand. Gauge (4' 8½") Section, Kantara-Haifa | 412¾ |
| Ludd Section, Jaffa-Jerusalem | 86.5 |
| Rafa-Beersheba | 59.5 |
| Ludd-Sarafand Military Siding | 7.3 |
| Kafr Jinis-Bet Nabala Quarry | 3.8 |
| Sidings | 6.1 |
| Ras El Ain-Petah Tikva Line | 6.1 |

Narrow Gauge (3' 6") Section, Haifa-Acre | 17.7 |
| Haifa-El Hamme | 92.3 |
| Nassib South | 332.2 |
| Ma'an | 332.2 |
| Afula-Nablus-Tulkarem | 80.9 |

The Kantara-Rafa Section, known as the "Sinai Military Railway" (approximately 200 kilometres), is operated by the Palestine Railways on behalf of the Air Ministry.

There is through communication with Egypt, and trains connect at Kantara West daily with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez and other parts of Egypt, railway vehicles being sent across the canal by means of a truck transporter.

East of Haifa the Palestine Railways system terminates at El Hamme, and the Section El Hamme-Deraa (Junction of the Hejaz Railway to Medina) is operated by the Hejaz Railway, which in turn is controlled by the French Government.
There are 550 kilometres of metalled roads in Palestine extensively used by motor transport, and in addition, many hundreds of kilometres of tracks passable for wheeled traffic of all kinds during dry weather.

Banking and Currency.

The most important Bank in Palestine is the Anglo-Egyptian, with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Gaza. The Anglo-Palestine Company has its head office in Jaffa, with branches in Jerusalem, Haifa, Tiberias and Safad. In addition, there are branches in Jerusalem of the Crédit Lyonnais, the Imperial Ottoman Bank (of the latter also in Haifa, Jaffa and Nablus, and sub-offices at Bethlehem and Ramallah), and the Banco di Roma. There is a Workers' Bank at Jaffa, and banks have been established for granting building loans to co-operative societies.

There is as yet no Palestinian currency. Egyptian Bank and Currency Notes, gold, silver and nickel coins, and British gold sovereigns at the rate of 97½ piastres Egyptian, are legal tender.

Other foreign coins, previously legal tender, were demonetised on 22nd January, 1921, by a Public Notice. Trade with Transjordan is carried on in gold and Turkish silver mejidis.

The metric system is followed by the Government, but the local weights and measures are still commonly employed.

For further information on all the above subjects, see the "Handbook of Palestine," (Luke, H. C. and Keith-Roach, E.), published in 1922 by Macmillan & Co., and issued under the authority of the Government of Palestine.

SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 600,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 500 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a secondcession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a thirdcession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1884 anothercession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1904. The present Rajah, H.H. Charles Vyner Brooke (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses a hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 300 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Mission have stations at various other places all over the Country.

Sibu, on the Rajang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut out in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baram, Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang, Lawas, Matu, Sarebas, Kalaka, Lundu, Miri.

Communications.

Vessels of the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited provide a service every 10 days between Kuching and Singapore; and a coasting service is maintained by that Company and by the Government.

There are roads only around the capital and thence to Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles). To open up country in the vicinity of the capital where communication by water is not available about 10 miles of railway has been constructed and is open for traffic, and a further 10 miles is in course of construction to be increased gradually hereafter; otherwise, internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.
