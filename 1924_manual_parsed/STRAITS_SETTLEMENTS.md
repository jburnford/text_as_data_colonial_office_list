STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, comprising Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 217 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 108 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 46 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 280 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 720 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 183 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 36' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed, by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by 4 mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers about 795.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and
placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 62 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number about 1,100, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employes of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17th March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 280 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end in 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bencoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca, under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 12 official members and 12 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Climate.

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1921 was 84°5°F.; in Penang, 81°8°F.; in Province Wellesley, 83°7°F.; and in Malacca, 80° F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between
There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1911 to 1920, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 171 wet days; the average monthly rainfall for the same period being 212 millimetres. In 1922 the total rainfall in Singapore was 2,587.25 millimetres; in Penang 3,192 millimetres; in Province Wellesley 2,837 millimetres; in Malacca 2,168.50 millimetre; and in the Dinding 1,804.5 millimetres. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoons blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have south-east, south or south-west winds for portions of the days as early as March or April.

The population as ascertained at the 1921 census was:

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe fortnightly by British India steamers, via Negapatam and Bombay, and fortnightly services by the Peninsular and Oriental and Messageries Maritimes vessels, via Ceylon; in addition there are fortnightly services by the Steamship Co. "Nederland" and the Rotterdam Lloyd; and at frequent intervals by the Holt's, Chargeurs Réunis, Glen, Shire, Japanese and other lines; with China and Japan once a fortnight by the P. and O. and M.M. lines, and by other lines frequently; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong Holt's Ellerman Line, and Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok by Straits steamship and other steamers and by train; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by various steamers; with Australian ports frequently by British India, Burns Philp, Ocean Steamship Co., Western Australia Steam Navigation Co., Commonwealth Government Line, K.P.M.; and other lines direct, and occasionally via Colombo, with the sailings thence of Orient Packets and P. and O.

Ten sub-marine cables radiate from Singapore: 5 to Penang, thence to Madras (3), Colombo (2), Deli (1); 1 to Batavia, thence to Cocos (1); 1 to Banjoewangie, thence to Darwin (2); 1 direct to Hong Kong; 1 to Cochin-China, thence to Hong Kong(1), and 1 to Labuan, thence to Hong Kong (1). There are also Government telegraph lines from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Pérak, Selangor, Pahang, Trengganu, Negri Sembilan, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Siam, Johore, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur (603 miles) was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 636 miles of telegraph line, 36 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley and 2 miles between Singapore and Johore and there are 41,261 miles of telephone line. The telephone exchange in Singapore, is worked by the Oriental Telephone Co. and the exchanges in Penang, Province Wellesley and Malacca, are worked by the Post Office. A section of the Federated Malay States Railway system connects Singapore and Bangkok, Province Wellesley from South to North with a section from Bukit Mertajam to Prai. Another section of the system runs from the docks of Singapore to Kranji, and a third section connects Malacca with the main line at Tampin, in Negri Sembilan.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided in Government or grant-in-aid schools and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are secular. There is a reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1922 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 11 | 5,079 | 4,854 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 31 | 14,078 | 13,285 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 198 | 14,943 | 13,600 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 10 | 558 | 470 |
| Total. | 250 | 34,658 | 32,209 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners

† The extensive docks owned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company were acquired by the Government in 1906, and are now controlled by a Board, composed of members appointed by the Governor under "the Straits Settlements Ports Ordinance."
were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece has been reduced.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of denominations 25 cents and ten cents have been issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver. These notes are only legal tender to the extent of $2.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, Chinese Commercial Bank, Communication Bank, The Yokohama Specie Bank, The Ho Hong Bank, The Oversea Chinese Bank and The China Southern Bank the Banque Industrielle de Chine, Lee Wah Bank.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1922 was $145,082 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the under-mentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec., 1899 — $3,920,000
" " 31st August, 1909—$27,569,475
" " 31st Dec., 1910—$101,587,186
" " 1921—$84,596,807
" " 1922—$72,944,004

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1922, the deposits amounted to $1,863,061.

The native Weights are:—

1 kati = 16 tahil = 1½ lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 533¾ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipalities at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, administered by Boards of Commissioners, appointed by the Governor. Their revenue and expenditure in 1922 were as follows:

LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 28·6 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam. The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty, by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1889 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and, as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1905, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore. On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was constituted a separate settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded great hopes of the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success. In 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited. The mines have been closed since the beginning of 1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty (not at present in use), and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the coaling jetties.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton and H.M. ships with coal, at 2l. 2s. 4d. per ton.
It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and béche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office Savings Bank in Labuan, but no other bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins. Straits notes are also available in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other natives from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

There are two schools, viz.:—The Government English School, and the Vernacular School which are maintained by the Government.

A reservoir owned by the Government supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking water.

The Eastern Extension, Australasian and China Telegraph Company has a station on the island connected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong and North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

A weekly service of steamers plying between Singapore, North Borneo Ports and the Philippines provides Labuan with regular communication with these places; there are, in addition, local coasting steamers. A number of larger seagoing vessels call at the Port for bunker and cargo coal and water.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are supplied by a Navy contractor.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues, land rents and licences.

BRUNEI.

H.H. Mohamed Jamalulalam, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 114° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. It is 770 nautical miles distant from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafatta, of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 4,000 square miles, containing a population of about 25,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait and Temburong.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei, and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000.

Besides the old Malay town which is built over the water on the Brunei River there is a new township on the mainland which has steadily developed since 1910. There are vernacular schools at Brunei and in some of the out-districts. The climate resembles that of the Federated Malay States. The average annual rainfall at Brunei is a little over 100 inches.

Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 600 in the capital. Native industries include fishing, cloth weaving, brass foundries and the manufacture of silversmiths' ware. The principal imports are rice, cloth, tobacco, sugar and petroleum, and the principal exports coal, cutch (mangrove extract), wild and plantation rubber, sago and dried prawns. The trade, to which an impetus was given by the inauguration of the new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber, while oil prospecting is being vigorously developed.

A cutch factory, established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muars (Brooketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882. The output of cutch in 1922 was 1,726 tons, valued at $172,600. The output of coal in 1922, was 18,683 tons, value $280,000.

The Sultan would derive a considerable income from yearly cession payments made by the State of British North Borneo and Sarawak Governments were they not mortgaged for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amount recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from land and mining rents, from an opium
monopoly under Government control, from the collection of customs duties, and from purchased Cession moneys. About half of the original Cession moneys have now been purchased by the Government.

Communications.

There is regular communication with Labuan by steam launch and so with Singapore by the Straits Steamship Company, which maintains a weekly service.

A Central Wireless Telegraph Station was opened in 1921 at Brunei with a subsidiary station at Labuan which enables telegraphic communication to be maintained with Labuan and thence by cable with Singapore and Europe. There is another Wireless Station in the Temburong District.

The Currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

The Federated Malay States comprise four States: Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang.

Perak.

Perak is ruled by a dynasty that claims descent from the last Malay Sultan of Malacca. In the 17th century it was overrun by the Acheenes, and at some time after 1636 a Johore prince, the husband of a Perak princess, was sent by Aceh to rule it under the title of Sultan Mudzaffar Shah. From 1650 onwards, the Dutch endeavoured to get a monopoly of the tin exported from Perak, establishing near the mouth of the Perak river several factories, which the Malays, from time to time, cut off and destroyed. In 1765 the Sultan made a treaty with the Dutch.

British influence began early in the 19th century. A treaty with Penang in 1818 secured to British subjects the right to free trade in Perak. In 1826 a British arbitrator settled the boundary between Perak and Selangor. By the Burney Treaty with Siam, in 1826, the independence of Perak and Selangor was recognised, though the Sultan of Perak was permitted to send tribute to Siam if he desired. In the same year the Sultan ceded to the British the Dindings and the island of Pangkor as posts for the suppression of piracy, and agreed to rely solely on the protection of Great Britain. From 1872 to 1874 there was almost continuous fighting of more or less severity between rival factions of Chinese in the Larut district where valuable tin deposits had been found.

Having regard to the anarchy which prevailed, Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874, induced the Perak chiefs to sign the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874), and to accept thereby a Resident whose advice should be "asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and customs." The murder of the first British Resident (Mr. J. W. Biroh) in 1875 led to a military expedition and the banishment of the Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair. The country soon settled; and the Malay constitution was restored under a Sultan protected by the British Government.

Selangor.

In the 14th century, Klang, which is now a district of Selangor, is said to have been subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the next century it was given a Penghulu of the family of the Bendaharas of old Malacca, and a son of Sultan Mansur Shah (1468-1477 A.D.) of Malacca was made ruler of Jeram, near Langat. During the period of Portuguese ascendancy, little is known of the Selangor coast. The Dutch opened factories for the purchase of tin at Kuala Selangor and at Kuala Linggi. In 1718 Daeng Chelak, a Bugis chief, who had married a Johore princess, settled at Kuala Selangor, and about 1780 their descendant was recognised as Sultan Salehuddin by the Sultan of Perak. The throne has remained in the same family ever since. In 1783, the Dutch blockaded Kuala Selangor and forced the Sultan to acknowledge the suzerainty of Holland.

In 1818 the Sultan of Selangor made a commercial treaty with the East India Company at Penang. In 1874 anarchy prevailed amongst the Malay chiefs at Selangor, and pirates ravaged the coastal trade. The Sultan's difficulties were such that he was glad to accept a British Resident, and to come under the protection of Great Britain.

Negri Sembilan.

This federation of "Nine States" consists of the four major States of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol and Rembau, and the five minor States of Ulu Muar, Jempul, Terachi, Gunong Pasir and Inas. Sungai Ujong is mentioned in a Javanese poem in 1385 as being subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the 16th century it was ruled by Chiefs of the old kingdom of Malacca. Nearly all the Malay inhabitants of the "Nine States" are descendants from immigrants from Menangkabau in Sumatra. Portuguese accounts prove that this immigration had begun in the 16th century. The original Malay federation consisted of Sungai Ujong, Klang (now a district of Selangor), Jelebu, Rembau, Naning (now part of Malacca), Segamat (now in Johore), Pasir Besar (also in Johore, its place having been taken by Johol), Jelai (now Inas) and Ulu Pahang, the region between the Ulu Serting and Temerloh. After the wresting of Malacca from the Portuguese by the Dutch and the Johore Malays in 1641, Johore took a leading part in Negri Sembilan politics until 1773, when the chiefs of the four major States brought from Sumatra a Yam Tuan named Raja Melewar, ancestor of the present Yang di-pertuan Besar.
In 1874, the Dato' Kiana, Chief of Sungai Ujong, the most important of the "Nine States," invited and obtained the assistance of the British Government to maintain his rule and the appointment of a British Resident. In 1883, Jelebu applied for a British Officer; and Rembau agreed to refer all its disputes to the British Government, and in 1887 accepted a British adviser. In 1889, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and the Rulers of Tampin and Rembau asked for a Resident, and agreed to a confederation known as "The Old Negri Sembilan." In 1895, the Resident of this confederation took charge of Sungai Ujong and of Jelebu, and the modern Negri Sembilan was constituted. Finally, in 1898, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti was elected titular Ruler of the whole State.

Pahang.

Chao Ju Kua, a Chinese, writing about 1225, mentions Pahang as being subject to the old Sumatran Buddhist Kingdom of Sri Vijaya. Later, Pahang and Tioman are claimed as conquests of Majapahit. In the 15th century, Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca captured the Ruler of Pahang, and married his daughter. Before the Malacca royal house died out, in 1699, its Pahang branch provided several Rulers for the senior throne of Johore, which directly represented the Malacca dynasty. Later, Pahang fell under the suzerainty of the new Sultans of Johore, who, when they removed to Lingga, left a Dato' Bendahara in charge of Pahang.

In 1887 Sir Frederick Weld negotiated a treaty with the Bendahara of Pahang, promising British help in the event of external attack, and arranging for a British agent to be stationed at his capital. At the same time, the title of Sultan was substituted for that of Dato' Bendahara. In 1888, the Sultan applied for and obtained British protection, and the appointment of a Resident.

Constitution of the States.

The supreme authority in each State is vested in the Sultan, or the ruler, in State Council. His Highness the Sultan or the ruler presides over the State Council. The British Resident is a member, and, in Perak and in Selangor, the Secretary to Resident is also a member. The other members consist of members of the royal family, the leading chiefs and some Chinese. Since the creation of a Federal Council, the State Councils legislate only on matters affecting the State.

The Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Chief Secretary and to the High Commissioner for the Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. They are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

The Federation.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States,* to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. They agreed to follow the Resident-General's advice in all matters of administration other than those touching Islam. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. At this meeting many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and at it the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

No further meetings of this nature have been held since 1903, as the necessity for them has been removed by an important development of the principle of Federation, which was introduced in 1909. In that year a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." The Federal Council consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Chief Secretary to Government, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British Residents, the Legal Adviser, the Financial Advisor, and six unofficial members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision is made in the agreement for the addition, if desired, of the heads of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficials. The Federal Council generally meets three times a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

Climate.

The temperature of the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula has but a small daily range and little appreciable variation. On the East Coast, however, the North-East Monsoon, lasting from November to March, causes a distinct meteorological contrast with the rest of the year as regards wind and rainfall. At Jelebu in Negri

* The title of this post has now been altered to Chief Secretary to Government.
Sembilan, the driest station where records were kept, the average for 1905-1919 was 60 inches, but in the mountains the average yearly rainfall is very high (258 inches near Taiping). The heat, owing to the moisture of the atmosphere, is at times oppressive, although 100° has never been recorded in the shade. The nights are cool. On the highest mountains, the temperature has been known to fall at night to 46° Fahrenheit. In the daytime, there is almost always a breeze to modify the heat. The Peninsula lies within the region of the South-West and the North-East Monsoons, but owing to the barrier provided by Sumatra, the only really strong wind is the North-East Monsoon, which strikes the East Coast from across the China Sea. Violent squalls, known as "Sumatras," are not infrequent on the West Coast of the Peninsula between April and September. Generally, they are of short duration and occur during the night.

**Population.**

At the 1921 census, the population of the Federated Malay States was 1,324,890. Of this population 853,628 were males and 471,362 females.

The Malay population rose from 420,840 in 1911 to 510,821 in 1921, an increase of 21·3 per cent. The very high rate of increase in Selangor (41·3 per cent) was due to the influx of foreign Malays, who have settled in the Coast Districts to plant rubber.

The Chinese population of the Federated Malay States was 494,648 or only 61,504 more than in 1911. Practically the whole of this increase was in Chinese females, who now number 351 to 1,000 males as compared with 118 in 1911, and the lessening disparity between the sexes among the Chinese indicates a general tendency towards their permanent settlement in the Federated Malay States.

The Indian population rose from 68,386 in 1901 to 173,465 in 1911, the increase synchronising with the early development of the rubber planting industry, and to 305,219 in 1921. The percentages of increase since 1911 were 77·2 in Perak, 78·9 in Selangor, 84·4 in Negri Sembilan, and 31·4 in Pahang. More than four-fifths of the Indians in the Federated Malay States are Tamils.

The European population of the Federated Malay States rose from 3,284 in 1911 to 5,686 in 1921, of whom 93·2 per cent. were of British nationality.

**Railways.**

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also in the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (120 miles), extending from Johore Bahru at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore Island, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas, the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Selangor, and Perak, then enters Province Wellesley, passing Prai — the port opposite Penang Harbour—about 472 miles from Johore Bahru, and thence proceeds through the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar, 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Siamese State Railways was opened on July 1st, 1918, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,188 miles.

The East Coast Line proceeds Northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan and Pahang towards Tumpat. It is completed and opened for traffic as far as Padang Tungku, 6 miles beyond Kuala Lipis, the capital of Pahang, and 147 miles from Gemas, whilst at the end of 1922 the permanent way had been laid as far as the 168th mile. The distance from railhead in Kelantan to railhead in Pahang is 80 miles. Work on this part has been temporarily stopped.

A section of 33½ miles in Kelantan, between Riverside, near Tanah Merah and Tumpat on the East Coast, is open for traffic, and this line when extended southward will meet the East Coast line from Gemas and provide through direct communication with Singapore and Kelantan. An extension has been made from Pasir Mas in Kelantan and runs in a westerly direction for 12 miles to the Golok River at the Siamese Boundary, where it joins with the Siamese line running to Haad Yai Junction, 145 miles distant, where a junction is made with the main Bangkok Penang Singapore Line.

Through working between the Federated Malay States and Kelantan via the Siamese State Railways commenced on November 1st, 1921.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson Wharf and Port Weld. At Prai, on the mainland opposite Penang, considerable progress has been made with the construction of deep water wharves, and it is hoped to open the wharves for ocean steamers by the end of 1923.

A causeway carrying two lines of rails and a roadway has been built across the Johore Strait to connect the island of Singapore with the peninsula, and was opened for passenger and goods traffic on 1st October, 1923.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States railway administration is 1,022 miles.

The line is of metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant cars. The expenditure on capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was £186,791,872 up to 31st December, 1922, and this has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

**Posts, Savings Bank, Telegraphs and Telephones.**

A well organised system of Posts extends throughout the Federated Malay States by rail, motor car, cycle, runner, sea and river. All towns and villages of any size have their regular deliveries and collections of mail matter and these facilities are being extended rapidly. The external mail services are frequent to all other ports of the world through Port Swettenham and through the Straits Settlements ports Singapore and Penang. The postal services include Parcel Post, Cash on Delivery (or Value Payable Post), Insurance, Money Orders, British Postal Orders, all these services extend to a great many different countries. They are operated at some 98 Post Offices by officers of the Posts and Telegraphs Department and at 38 other places by stationmasters and others. Savings Bank business is transacted at all Post Offices at all hours at which they are open, the Bank being controlled by the Department. The interest payable on deposits is 3 per cent.

Telegraph lines connect all the Post Offices and most of the "Allowance Offices" (i.e. offices operated by Station Masters and others) with a
main trunk system throughout the Peninsula, and through Singapore and Penang with the rest of the world by submarine cable and by wireless. The Department has its own telegraph lines through the State of Johore connecting the Federated Malay States with Singapore. Local lines connect offices in Johore, Kedah and Trengganu with offices in the Federated Malay States. During 1922 a line connecting Betong in Siam with Kroh in the Federated Malay States was constructed.

The Telephone system extends throughout the Federated Malay States. There are 22 public exchanges maintaining a continuous night and day service and 38 other places at which Call Offices are maintained giving a service restricted to the hours during which the local Post Office is open for the transaction of public business. Of the 98 Post Offices in the Federated Malay States, 60, therefore, are provided with public telephone facilities. At most of the remaining places calls including trunk calls can, in case of emergency, be made from the local Police Stations.

The public exchanges are situated at Batu Gajah, Gopeng, Ipoh, Kampar, Kuala Kangsar, Sungkai, Taiping, Tanjong Malim, Tapah and Telok Anson in Perak, at Banting, Kajang, Klang, Kuala Kubu, Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Selangor, Port Swettenham, and Rawang in Selangor, and Kuala Pilah, Port Dickson, Seremban and Tampin in Negeri Sembilan.

All the exchanges are connected by means of trunk lines and trunk calls can be made by subscribers to all exchanges and from all Call Offices and in case of emergency from the local Police Stations when the Call Offices are closed.

The Federated Malay States telephone system is connected to the telephone system in Malacca and through Malacca with North Johore.

In the near future trunk communication will also be possible between the Federated Malay States and Penang—two trunk lines being under construction.

Several new exchanges are projected and will be constructed when the circumstances render this possible.

The State of Pahang on the east side has no public telephones but a Police system connects all the police stations. The police telephone system is erected and maintained by the Posts and Telegraphs Department.

There are 2,550 miles of telegraph and telephone lines in the Federated Malay States with a wire mileage of 15,062 miles. In addition there are 53 miles of underground cables with a wire mileage of 5,196 miles. The Department also has 122 miles of telegraph line with a wire mileage of 367 miles in the State of Johore.

Péraí.

H.H. Paduka Sri Sultan Iskandar Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni Idris, Sultan.

Péraí is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress.

The State, is well watered, the Péraí (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Para, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 74,102 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Péraí is (a) 876 of metalled and (b) 58 of unmetalled cart roads, 1,101 miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residencies at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Péraí for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Péraí, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory, which was taken over on the 16th July, 1909, and incorporated in the Upper Péraí District, exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Logeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasek on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Selangor.

H.H. Ala'idin Sulaiman Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni Al-Marham Raja Muda Musa, Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Péraí, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

Its coast line extends for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Péraí and Selangor, the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The natives are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor, each under a British District Officer.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 80,356 (1921 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 59 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden.
covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence.

There are 176 schools in the State, comprising two Government English Schools, 72 Government Vernacular Schools, 92 Grant-in-aid Vernacular Schools and 10 Grant-in-aid English Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, which called at the port in 1922 was 1,317,721.

The total revenue of the State in 1922, was $20,873,174, and the expenditure, $19,247,359.

There is no public debt except such as is included in the public debt of the Federation.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. The only import duties are those charged on spirituous liquors, beers, petroleum, and tobacco. In 1922 the gross total value of imports was $39,055,945, and exports $49,374,195.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1922 was 191,734 pikuls, valued at $15,693,296. The area alienated for mining is 55,790 acres. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned owing to the fall in price. There are 78,080 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides. Most of the large estates have been converted into or sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1922 the area under rubber cultivation was approximately 417,737 acres. The value of cultivated rubber exported during 1922 was $27,220,170.

The road mileage is: metalled cart roads, 775; gravelled cart roads, 76; natural cart roads, 46; and bridle paths, 146 miles.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Muhammad, K.C.M.G., ibni Al-Marhum Antah, Yang di Pertuan Besar.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan lies on the Western side of the Peninsula and is bounded on the North-west by Selangor, on the North-east by Pahang, on the East by Johore, on the South by Malacca, and on the South-west by the sea.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and at Tampin.

The value of imports amounted to $5,861,099 in 1922, and that of exports to $15,575,355. The revenue of the State, which in 1922 amounted to $5,219,944, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1922, 12,844 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 458,843 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemeneh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative.

The Malay population, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coco-nuts.

During 1922 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:—Rubber 279,660 acres, rice 30,691 acres, and coco-nuts 10,468 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses 71 Malay vernacular schools, seven English schools and 11 Tamil schools.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 447 miles of metalled and 9 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 245 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Al-Mu'tasim Bi'llah Al-Sultan Abdullah, K.C.M.G., ibni Al-Marhum Al-Sultan Ahmad Al-Maazam Shah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang
River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming part of the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Bentong, Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital, which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast line of the Federated Malay States Railways was opened for traffic as far as Padang Tungku, 5 miles north of Kuala Lipis on 16th March, 1921.

There is a motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles; also twice weekly from Jerantut Station on the Railway to Kuantan, a distance of 109 miles.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, and from Benta to Kuantan (147½ miles), have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungei Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

The total revenue of the State during 1922 amounted to $2,201,738, and the expenditure to $2,606,736.
