ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. The Settlement (the total area of which, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas:—Aden proper (area 21 square miles) on the south, and Little Aden (area 15 square miles) on the west—and a flat strip of coast, about three miles broad and known as Shaikh Othman (area 39 square miles). The peninsulas form the horns of a bay called Aden Baok Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. The native town of Aden is situated on the east of the Aden peninsula, opposite a gap in the crater walls. On the west side of the peninsula, some four miles from the town, is Steamer Point, off which the large steamers lie. The highest point of the peninsula is 1,776 feet above sea level. The average annual rainfall is about 3 inches, and the maximum is about 8 inches. The climate is very hot, especially during the summer months. Aden is an important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc. The population
is about 45,000, of whom about 35,000 live in Aden peninsula. The settlement has hitherto been subject to the Government of Bombay, being presided over by a Resident, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison.

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians and Persians. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1651 and held it until they were expelled from the Yemen in 1630. The Aden peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchases in 1882 and 1888.

The Aden Protectorate, to the north and northeast of Aden, has an area of about 9,000 square miles and a population of over 100,000.

Perim, a bare rocky island, five square miles in area, with a population of about 1,200, lies in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, about 1½ miles from the south-west corner of Arabia. It possesses a good harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth. It was occupied by the British in 1799, but subsequently abandoned, and was only re-occupied in 1867, when the overland route to India made the position important. It is a coaling and cable station, and forms part of the Settlement of Aden.

Socotra, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 13'—12° 42' N. lat., and 53° 21'—53° 30' E. long, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the Government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 12,000. It is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.

TRISTAN DA CUNHA.

Tristan da Cunha is the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. long., 12° 2' W. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. Upon his death the garrison was withdrawn, with the exception of three men, who, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement. For a long time only one of the settlers had a wife, but subsequently the others contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. The population is about 100. The inhabitants practically enjoy their possessions in common, and there is no strong drink on the island, and no crime. It was at one time proposed to give them laws and a regular government, but this was found unnecessary for the above reasons, and they remain under the moral rule of their oldest inhabitant.

The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885.

In the way of live stock, the inhabitants have between them about 400 head of cattle, about 700 sheep, about 50 pigs, and an abundance of poultry. Potatoes do well, and a good crop is got annually. Apple trees and peach trees are in fair number, and bear well; there are also a few fig trees, but they do not fruit. The tree of the island, which apparently is a juniper, and upon which the islanders are dependent for their wood for fuel, is getting scarce in the neighbourhood of settlement, but is abundant further off, and there is no fear of supply failing.

In January, 1904, the island was visited by H.M.S. "Odin" in order to ascertain whether the islanders would accept the offer of the Cape Government to settle them in the Cape Colony, but out of eleven families only three families elected to go. The islanders are liable from time to time to privations. In March, 1907, owing to information indicating probability of failure of supplies, relief was sent by His Majesty's Government by the "Greyhound," chartered at Cape Town. On this occasion also the inhabitants were unwilling to leave the island, and the Rev. J. G. Barrow, a clergyman who had gone to the island in April, 1906, reported that though there is sure to be privation from time to time, it does not cause absolute distress. (See correspondence presented to Parliament in Cd. 3098 and Cd. 3764.)

January, February, and March are the best months for visiting the island. It is in these months that weather at times becomes so settled that the islanders are able to make visits to Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands, which are some 25 miles off. They also are often able to visit these islands in November.

MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for coconut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island and Cato Island (in the Norfolk Island Group), Sombrero (West Indies, with a Board of Trade Lighthouse costing £20 annually) Raine Island, Bell Cay and Bramble Cay (near British New Guinea), Caroline Island, Flint Island and Vostok Island (Pacific Ocean, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat., and 151° 48' W. long.), Malden Island (4° 1' S. lat., 155° 57' W. long.), leased to Messrs. Grice, Sumner, and Co., and Starbuck Island; also Gough, Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands (in the S. Atlantic), and there are many others.

The Great and Little Basses and Minicoy are small islets in the Indian Ocean, with lighthouses maintained by the Board of Trade out of shipping dues levied on vessels passing, and collected at Ceylon, Mauritius, Straits, and Indian ports.

The Kuria-Muria Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable.

Amboyna Cay and Sprattley Island (lat. 8° 38' N., 111° 54' E. long.; lat. 7° 52' N., 112° 58' E. long.), two uninhabited sandbanks in the middle of the China Sea, lying about 240 miles N.W. of Borneo and 100 miles N. of Labuan, were annexed in 1877, and leased for guano collection. They are annually visited by Chinese junks for the purpose of collecting turtle.
