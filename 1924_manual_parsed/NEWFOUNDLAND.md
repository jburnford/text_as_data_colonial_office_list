NEWFOUNDLAND.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 42,000 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom. Population, 259,308.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Hudson's Strait to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound, the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,300 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, amongst the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Hebron, Ramah, and Killinek. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norseman Lief, son of Eric the Red, in A.D. 1,000, and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1769). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863 and again in 1909. During the summer months several Justices of the Peace are upon the coast.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise this island, but were not successful. In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert formerly took possession of the Island in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and it was incorporated into the realm of England. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the southeast part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieuc, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they were allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right was an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it did not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1888 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (see Cd. 1952). The arrangement has been of great benefit to the Colony, since it removed an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Dried cod is the largest export (1,363,792 qts. in 1921); other large exports are herrings, lobsters, salmon, iron, fish oils, seal skins, and timber. Copper is worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The establishment of large and well-equipped paper mills at Grand Falls, in the interior, by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, has opened up a very large industry. The paper and paper pulp is shipped to the United Kingdom and used in the principal London printing offices, while, during 1917, some of the publishing houses in the United States have been supplied. A model town has been laid out which is well lighted, watered, and drained. It is very pictur-esque situated, and is on the line of the Reid

Newfoundland Company's railway through the interior, while a private line of rail connects the works with Botwood, the principal port on the Exploits for summer shipments.

The Albert Reed Company, of London, have completed a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about nine miles from Grand Falls, where pulp is being manufactured for English mills. This company have also installed machinery for the manufacture of paper. At Lomond, in Bonne Bay, on the West Coast, the St. Lawrence Lumber and Pulp Co. are erecting large mills for the manufacture of lumber and pulp, and propose to erect mills for the making of paper. At Glevortown, on the Terra Nova River, Bonavista Bay, a company is now installing a plant for the manufacture of sulphite pulp. Both these companies will operate on a large scale.

The Humber development scheme, which has recently been launched by the Newfoundland Power and Paper Co., Ltd., with the full sanction of the Newfoundland Government, will utilize water power capable of developing hydro-electric energy of 250,000 horse power, and will involve the employment of more than 1,500 people, and the making of a new town at Comer Brook of about 7,000 people in the western portion of the Island. The mills will have a producing capacity of 400 tons of finished paper daily. Apart from the power required for the mills, there will be a surplus sufficient for all local or domestic purposes on the whole of the west coast, and also for the large mining areas in that part.

The scheme has received support from both the British and Newfoundland Governments, the British Government guaranteeing £2,000,000 under the Trade Facilities Act.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1920-21 was 1,363,792 quintals, value $13,334,954; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 126. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Bank of Commerce have been opened in St. John's, branches of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace and in twenty-two other towns; branches of the Bank of Montreal at Carbonear, Bay of Islands, Grand Falls, and four other places; and seven branches of the Royal Bank of Canada at various points.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1896) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4.863 to the pound sterling.

In the Government Savings Bank deposits in 1921 were $2,172,659.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $525,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance from Whitbourne of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, via Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,446,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, Carbonear, and Burnt Bay are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. Other branch lines have been constructed to Bonavista, Hearts' Content, Grate's Cove and Trepassey, in all about 189 miles. By the transinsular railway regular connection is made with the continent thrice weekly, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamer "Kyle" which makes the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 4,591 miles of telegraph lines and 965 miles of telephones. The Government cable, laid in 1906 between Port-aux-Basques and Canso in Nova Scotia, gives quick communication with both America and Europe. This cable was sold to the Commercial Cable Company in 1922. The Anglo-American cables start for Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable landed at St. John's, the Direct (now "Imperial") cable at Harbor Grace, and the Western Union at Bay Roberts, and all connect with both Europe and America. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The Furness-Withy Line of steamers runs between Liverpool and St. John's, and between St. John's and Halifax, making about sixteen trips each way annually, monthly in winter, and at intervals of about three weeks in summer. The south and west coast has a weekly steamer service from Placentia, and also a fortnightly service per steamer from St. John's. Two steamers make trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer at intervals of eight to ten days, and another makes fortnightly trips between St. John's and Griguet in the north of the island, calling at all the important intermediate settlements. Smaller steamers ply on the five great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

- Letters,
  - 1st 1 oz. Newspapers.
  - In St. John's . . . 2 cents under 4 oz.
  - Within Colony . . . 3 cents 1 cent.
  - To United Kingdom and Colonies 4 , 1 cent for 2 oz.
  - Europe and St. Pierre, for 1st oz. 6 cents
    - Miguelon 3 cents per succeeding oz.
    - South America, etc. 1 ,, ditto.
  - To United States . . 4 cents. 1 ,, ditto.

* Plus one cent. War Tax on all letters.
Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's is about 42°, the extreme range being from 0° to 81°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1918 was 49 inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Beothuks tribe.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1916 and its Amendment Act of 1920. By the new Act the Central Administration is vested in the Department of Education, presided over by the Minister of Education who is a member of the Executive Council. The education policy of the new Government provides for the establishment of an up-to-date Normal School and the appointment of 11 District School Supervisors. There are three Superintendents of Education belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican and the Methodist Denominations. There were in 1921, 1,107 schools with 55,599 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and a small vote of $4,767 was passed for technical education. In 1910 a special grant of $100,000 was made for the erection, re-modelling and equipment of school buildings in places outside the city of St. John's.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature $14,425

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 36,444 inhabitants. Other towns of importance are Harbour Grace, with a population of 3,825; Bonavista 4,052; Carbonear 3,320; Twillingate 3,217; and Grand Falls, 3,769. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1923—65,224 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500l. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $250 each (President $500) per session. Members of the Assembly receive $1,000 each per session. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a Mayor and 6 Councillors elected under the provisions of the Municipal Act, 1921.

NEWFOUNDLAND—NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the South, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Dominion: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°-45° S. lat., 176°-177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island and adjacent islets is 44,130 square miles, of the South Island 58,120 square miles, of Stewart Island 662 square miles, of Chatham Islands 372 square miles, and other islands, including the Cook Islands, 577 square miles, a total area of 103,861 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. long., and 33° and 53° S. lat., were annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, was annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macaulay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Dominion to include the group as well as Savage (Niue) Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of New Zealand are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Rarotonga, Mangaia, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mitiaro, Mauka, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avarau), Savage (Niue), Pukapuka (Danger), Rakanga, Manahiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suwarrow.

An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

The principal Allied and Associated Powers, assembled at Versailles, decided that the islands of Western Samos should be assigned under mandate to New Zealand; and a mandate was issued by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920, in favour of New Zealand. The group which lies about 400 miles N.E. from Fiji contains several islands, of which Savaii and Upolu are the largest. The total area is some 1,250 square miles.

It was also decided that the phosphate island of Nauru (Pleasant Island), lying in 0°33' south latitude, and 166°55' east longitude, should be administered by New Zealand conjointly with the United Kingdom and Australia.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the average death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at
Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (55°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (50°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington in 1922 was 57°, from 82° in summer to 26° in winter. The rainfall varied from a mean for the year 1922 of 21 inches on the east coast, to 119 inches on the west coast of the South Island, and from 22 inches on the east coast, to 52 inches on the west coast and 41 inches in the interior of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 10 years 1913–1922 was 24·56 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·90. The birth rate in 1922 was 23·17 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 8·77.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 800 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1921, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 52,751, almost all of whom dwelt in the North Island.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely affected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and a constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act New Zealand was divided into six provinces, afterwards increased to ten, but subsequently reduced to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers were now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Dominion into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1882, consisting of the Governor (now Governor-General), a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor-General is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Dominion for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor-General, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments were made tenable for seven years only. Provision has now been made for an elective Legislative Council to consist of 40 European members and not more than 3 Maori members, the latter to be appointed by the Governor-General. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector, male or female, is qualified to become a member (the Women's Parliamentary Rights Act, passed in 1919, gives women the right to be elected to either house).

The House of Representatives now consists of 80, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 31½N. a year, payable monthly.

Members of the House of Representatives receive 450L. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Dominion and one month in an electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote and are eligible for election as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the New Zealand Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Dominion is divided into 118 municipalities and 129 counties; the latter being subdivided into 68 road districts and 74 town districts, besides River, Drainage, Water Supply, Tramway, Local Railway, Harbour, and Electric Power Districts. For the year ended 31st March, 1922, the total receipts of the above local authorities amounted to 15,341,589£, and their expenditure to 15,091,875£.
Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to £30,266,204., exclusive of £4,567,545. outstanding in loans from the New Zealand Government State Advances Office, and also of £2,381,790. inscribed by the Treasury under the now-repealed Local Bodies' Loans Acts and outstanding at 1st Feb., 1922. The net indebtedness on these various classes of loans was at the same dates £27,018,370., £4,097,095. and £1,328,174. respectively.

Education.

A Government system of primary education was established in 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of nine Education Boards, and of School Committees with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of primary schools (called "public schools"), 2,550; scholars on roll, 213,097. Primary education is free, secular, and compulsory. In addition for native (Maori) education there are 127 village schools maintained by the Government and under the control of the Minister, nine Native mission schools, and ten denominational boarding schools. Scholars on roll of village schools, 6,161 (including 814 Europeans); on the roll of mission schools, 363; and on roll of boarding schools, 413 of whom 106 hold Government free places. Net cost of native school education in 1922-23 was £69,631. In the Chatham Islands four schools are maintained, and there are three schools, under the control of the Cook Islands Administration, in the Cook Islands. During the year 1922, 263 private primary schools with a roll number of 24,861 were registered under the Education Act. A School Journal providing suitable reading matter is provided by the Department and issued free to all children in Government schools. A comprehensive system of physical education and schemes of dental and medical inspection are in operation in the primary schools, the latter now being under the control of the Department of Health. Four training colleges make provision for the training of teachers, the roll number for the last quarter of 1922 being 1,151. There is also provision for training classes at smaller centres. The number of adult primary school teachers in 1922 was 5,465, pupil teachers 587, and the number of probationers 767. The total expenditure by the Government under the head of primary education was for 1922-23, £2,165,200. There is a system of superannuation for teachers giving an annuity of one-sixtieth of the average of the final three years' salary for each year of service.

Secondary education is provided at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools, the numbers of operative schools under each heading in 1922 being 36, 61, and 13 respectively, with a total roll number as follows: Secondary schools, 10,738; district high schools (secondary departments), 2,600; technical high schools, 4,202. In addition 27 private secondary schools were registered under the Education Act, the roll number being 1,998. In scholarships and free places at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools, 16,025 pupils received free secondary education. Provision is made for manual instruction in both primary and secondary schools, cookery, dressmaking, woodwork, elementary agriculture, dairywork, and the various branches of elementary science being included in the subjects taken. Instruction of a technical or vocational character is provided at a large number of technical schools and classes, besides the technical high schools mentioned above, the courses of instruction followed being commercial and general, industrial, domestic, agriculture, and art. The total number of students attending such classes in 1922 was 12,262, of whom 4,406 received free education.

For higher education there are four endowed colleges affiliated to the University of New Zealand, and each specializes in one or more directions. At Dunedin the special subjects are mining, medicine, dental, veterinary, and domestic science; at Christchurch, engineering and technical science; at Wellington, law and science; at Auckland, commerce and mining. There is an agricultural college at Lincoln possessing a large endowment and an experimental farm of a very complete character. The number of students on the books of the University Colleges was, in 1922, 3,968, of which number 1,578 or 40 per cent. were receiving free education. The total expenditure by the Government on university education in 1922-23 was £28,974.

The care of neglected and delinquent children and of orphans is undertaken by the Education Department, which adopts the boarding-out system, combined with various residential institutions serving for the classification of those that have to be kept under discipline. Of the 3,798 children on the rolls of industrial schools and receiving homes only 906 were in residence in Government or private industrial schools and reformatories, and 1,969 were boarded out with foster parents. The rest were at service, with friends, on probation, etc. 277 children admitted to probation were also under the Department's supervision. On the grounds of moral degeneracy or unfitness in the public interest to be free from oversight detention beyond the age of 21 may be extended by a magistrate from time to time, thus securing life-long control where necessary. Expenditure for 1922-23, £93,914.

Maintained by the Government are special schools for the deaf and the feeble-minded. Deaf: 135 pupils cost the Government £6,423.; feeble-minded: 230 pupils cost £8,261. net. The education of blind, deaf, feeble-minded and epileptic children is compulsory from six to twenty-one years of age, subject to exemption by the Minister. The feeble-minded can be kept permanently under restraint, each case being judicially reviewed at intervals of not more than four years. A School for the Blind at Auckland is subsidized by the Government.

The infant life protection system which provides for the supervision of infants under six years who are maintained apart from their parents for monetary consideration is also administered by the Education Department. There are 742 infants under supervision in 601 licensed homes. The death rate is under 1 per cent.

For the financial year 1922-23 the total cost to the Education Department of the services mentioned above was £3,187,292.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 17th April, 1921, was found by the census to be 1,218,913 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 52,751, and Cook and other Pacific Islands (13,269). The estimated population of New Zealand (excluding Maoris and residents of Cook and other Pacific Islands), on 30th June, 1923, was 1,272,999.

The population of the chief towns on the 29th April, 1906; 2nd April, 1911; 15th October, 1916, and 17th April, 1921, was as follows:—
Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Dominion up to 31st December, 1922, was valued at 90,164,457L. The wool exported in 1922 amounted to 321,533,215 lbs., valued at 11,882,483L. In 1886 it amounted to 2,559,618 lbs., valued at 146,070L. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at 19,339L, had developed an export for 1889 of 656,822 cwt., valued at 783,374L, in 1893 to 903,836 cwt., valued at 1,085,167L, in 1898, 1,551,773 cwt., valued at 1,698,750L, in 1903, 2,378,650 cwt., valued at 3,197,043L, in 1908, 2,120,303 cwt., valued at 3,188,515L, in 1913, 2,578,693 cwt., valued at 4,449,933L, in 1918, 2,036,904 cwt., valued at 4,957,576L, and in 1922, 3,518,004 cwt., valued at 8,387,461L. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1923, was: horses, 330,818 against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 3,480,694 against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 23,081,439 against 11,704,853 in 1874. The total area of occupied holdings over one acre in extent in 1923 was 43,663,163 acres; 275,776 acres were in wheat (for threshing only), having a total yield of 8,396,023 bushels. The area under oats for all purposes was 445,306 acres, of which 143,090 acres were threshed, giving a total yield of 5,688,157 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton, Napier, Nelson, Wellington and Timaru are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1922, 556 vessels registered, of 92,344 (net) tons in the aggregate. Many of the larger vessels formerly on the register were transferred to the London register to take advantage of the Imperial War rates.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware and machinery, sugar, tea, tobacco, alcohol, books, stationery, motor vehicles, drugs and chemicals, and oils; and they are obtained almost entirely from the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, Canada, Ceylon, Japan and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches, two are New Zealand Institutions, in the Dominion:- Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, Bank of Australasia, and Commercial Bank of Australia (Limited). The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand for the year 1922 (average of four quarters), was 45,913,394L, and of their note circulation 7,019,220L. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Dominion, having on 31st March, 1923, 840 branches; the amount deposited therein at that date was 44,360,333L. The private savings banks number five, and the total amount to credit of depositors at March 31st, 1923, was 4,663,702L.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling, but the issues of the six banks carrying on in the Dominion have been declared legal tender until 10th January, 1926.

Government Insurance Department.

Life Branch.

This department commenced to transact business in March, 1870. By an Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land was constituted. This board consists of the Minister of Finance, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Superintendent N.Z. State Advances Office, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. Loans on mortgage not exceeding 10,000L to any one person or company are empowered. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first-class lives to the amount of 10,000L, and in the case of the Accident Branch to the amount of 2,000L. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves. In general the office is conducted very much after the style of a mutual insurance company.

Accident Branch.

The Accident Branch of the Government Insurance Department was opened in 1901, for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance. General accident business is undertaken, but the branch was opened more especially with a view to relieve employers of labour of the liability imposed upon them by "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900." This Act greatly extended the liability of employers, and gave to a workman the right of compensation for all injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, not attributable to his own serious and willful misconduct.

This liability has been extended by subsequent Acts, the principal amendments being in 1908, 1920 and 1922. Under the Workers' Compensation Act, 1922 (mainly a consolidating enactment) which came into force on the 1st April, 1923, the scale of compensation is as follows:—

(a.) Where death results from the injury and the workman leaves dependants wholly dependent upon his earnings, the compensation is one hundred and fifty-six times his average weekly earnings, but not to be less than 200L nor to exceed 750L.

(b.) If the dependants are only partially dependent upon the workman's earnings, the compensation is to be such sum as is reasonable and proportionate to the injury to such dependants, but not exceeding the amount payable under paragraph (a).

(c) In either of the above cases the employer is also liable for medical and burial expenses not exceeding 50L, and an amount not exceeding this sum can be claimed where there are no dependants.
(d) Where a workman is totally incapacitated for work, he is entitled to a weekly payment of 58½% of his average weekly earnings, but the weekly compensation is not to be less than £1, in cases where the worker's earnings at the time of the accident are not less than 30s. per week. Persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour, whose earnings exceed 400L a year, are excluded from the benefits of the Act and the maximum weekly payment is limited to 3L 15s.

(e) Where the workman is partially incapacitated only, the compensation is 58½% of the loss of wages.

(f) In addition to the compensation for incapacity medical or surgical expenses are allowed, not exceeding £1.

Weekly payments are not to extend over a longer period than six years, and the aggregate amount is not to exceed 750L.

The Department's policies cover the full liability of an employer to his workmen under the Workers' Compensation Act, and also suitably protect him against liability under the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act, and the Common Law.

Policies protecting mortgagees from loss through the charge of an injured workman taking precedence of a mortgage are issued at premiums varying from 1s. per cent. of the mortgage for small mortgages to 6d. per cent. for large mortgages.

Personal accident policies are also issued securing amounts for accidental death and permanent total or partial disablement, and weekly allowances during temporary disablement whether caused by accident or sickness.

The premium income and claims of the Accident Branch during the last ten years have been as follows:

| Year | Premium Income | Claims |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Year ending 31st December, 1913 | 23,277 | 11,492 |
| "    | 1914           | 22,090 | 9,633 |

State Fire Insurance.

In the year 1903 was passed an Act "to establish a State Fire Insurance Office and to make other provisions for the insurance and protection of insurable property in New Zealand against loss or damage by fire."

The statute provided for the establishment of an office to be administered by a General Manager appointed by the Governor-General, and for the necessary staff.

Provision is made for the constitution of a Board, to consist of the General Manager, the Minister of Finance, the Government Insurance Commissioner, and two other persons (not being in the Civil Service) appointed by the Governor-General. The latter hold office for two years, with eligibility for re-appointment.

The Department opened for business with branches and agencies throughout the Dominion in January, 1906. The opening of the office resulted in a reduction in the rates then current of 3¾ per cent. on dwellings and the less hazardous risks, and of 10 per cent. on all others. A rebate of 15% in all cases is being given for the year 1923-24. The total accumulated profit made to the end of December, 1922, was 342,970L., and the net income and net losses for each of the ten years to that date have been as follows:

| Year | Net Income, less Re-insurances | Net Losses |
|------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1913 | 61,281                        | 27,975     |
| 1914 | 67,693                        | 28,110     |

Public Works.

All the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under road boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1923, there were 3,039 miles of Government and 135 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 330 miles of Government under construction. The construction of new lines and the extension of existing ones has proceeded steadily in recent years but has necessarily been held up during the last year or so on account of the war.

The expenditure on the 3,039 miles of opened Government railways has been 39,946,413L., or an average of 13,144L. a mile. This includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1922-1923 was 6,727,802L., and the working expenses 5,502,497L. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraph and inter-urban telephone circuits there are 11,912 miles of line and 48,616 miles of wire. There are 337 Morse telegraph offices, 1,966 telephone offices, and 323 telephone exchanges, the latter having 102,261 connections with 6,873 miles of line and 229,882 miles of wire. 363 coin-in-the-slot telephones are in use.

The underground duct system of telephone cable distribution, and the automatic telephone switching system are being extended to the principal exchanges. There are seven submarine cables, connecting the two islands of New Zealand; two Wellington-Sydney, one Auckland-Sydney, and...
one Auckland-Brisbane, via Norfolk Island, connecting the Dominion with Australia, and one connecting Auckland with Suva.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December, 1902. The laying of the Auckland-Suva cable was completed on the 25th August, 1923.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was 3s. a word, Government messages 1s. 6½d., and Press 1s. a word. These rates have since been reduced by 4d. per word for ordinary messages, and 2½d. per word for Government messages. The charge for press messages has also been reduced to 7½d. per word and a deferred rate for press instituted at 4½d. per word.

An ordinary deferred telegram system has been instituted with a maximum delay of 24 hours at half the charge for ordinary cable messages. Two other classes of cheap cable messages known respectively as Daily Letter Telegrams (which are subject to 48 hours delay during transmission) and Week-End Letter Telegrams are exchanged with the United Kingdom and Canada. The rates are as follows:

**Daily Letter Telegrams.**

| Per Word | Min. Charge |
|----------|-------------|
| United Kingdom | 8½d. | 13s. 4½d. |
| Canada | 6½d. | 10s. 0½d. |

**Week-End Telegrams.**

| Per Word | Min. Charge |
|----------|-------------|
| United Kingdom | 7½d. | 11s. 8½d. |
| Canada | 5½d. | 8s. 9½d. |

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is about 1,550 a day by both routes.

In the year ending 31st March, 1923, excluding the value of Government messages, the telegraph revenue was £1,309,347L (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 13,513,208 (of which number 13,342,823 were private or press messages). The minimum rate on ordinary telegrams is 9½d. for 12 words; additional words 1½d. each.

There are seven wireless telegraph coast stations in and around New Zealand, which are under the control of the New Zealand Government, namely: Awanui, Auckland, Wellington, Awana, on the mainland and in addition Chatham Islands, Rarotonga and Apia. Of these, all but Awanui, Awana and Apia are low power stations.

In addition there are 21 wireless ship-stations registered in New Zealand.

Tramways have been established in most of the principal towns in New Zealand.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, New Plymouth, Invercargill, Napier and Wanganui have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle, while a system in Gisborne is worked with storage battery cars. In Wellington and Dunedin there are cable tramways connecting with the higher levels. In Wanganui the higher levels of Campbelltown are reached by means of an elevator. In Christchurch, in addition to electricity, some casual traffic is operated by means of steam tramway locomotives.

The total expenditure by the General Government on the construction of roads and bridges from the inauguration of the Public Works policy in 1870, till the end of March, 1923, amounted to £13,759,722L.

The Government has also expended on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels, and in aiding works on mineral lands, etc., £83,929L.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations.

All the principal towns in the Dominion have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In many of the towns of New Zealand, both large and small, electric generating stations have been established, operated by steam, water, and internal combustion engines for the supply of electrical energy for street lighting, domestic lighting, heating, cooking, etc., and for power purposes. These installations are generally under the control of the corporations.

The Government has designed and carried out an important scheme for the development of electrical energy from water power at Lake Coleridge in Canterbury. The powerhouse is designed to generate 12,000 K.W., the present plant capacity being 12,000 K.W., and the present maximum load about 9,390 K.W., which is rapidly increasing. Arrangements are now being made to increase the plant capacity to 27,000 K.W. The total number of units generated for year ended 31st March, 1923, was 43,451,660. The current is transmitted at a pressure of 66,000 volts over three separate transmission lines to Christchurch, 63 miles distant, where it is utilised to operate the tramways, and for public and private lighting, manufacturing and general industrial and farming purposes throughout an area of some 300 square miles. The cost of generation at Lake Coleridge amounted to 7½d. per K.W. year, or 0'498d. transmitted and sold in bulk in Christchurch, including operating and capital charges. Extension of the system of transmission and distribution to South Canterbury and other districts is under construction. Future developments will probably include the operation of suitable sections of the Government railways, the manufacture of fertilisers, and possibly of munitions of war. The scheme is under the direct control of the Government, and has been in successful operation since February, 1915. There are many other natural sources of power available in different parts of the Dominion, totalling over 4,886,030 h.p., and the development of one of the most promising in the North Island is in progress. The Lake Coleridge scheme has cost up to year ending 31st March, 1923, £48,033L. In the North Island the only plant at present operated by the Government in connection with the national electric supply system is situated at Hora Hora on the Waikato River. The installed capacity is 6,300 K.W. which will shortly be increased to 10,300 K.W. The output for year ending 31st March, 1923, was 33,732,150 units but with the demand for power in the Waikato District the annual output will rapidly increase. The capital cost up to 31st March, 1923, was £395,022L. A comprehensive scheme for the development, transmission and distribution of power throughout the North Island has been submitted to Parliament and a similar scheme has been developed for the South Island.

In the meanwhile the following authorizations have been passed by Parliament:

Dunedin is lighted by electricity generated by water power from the Waipori River, under the control of the City Corporation, which also supplies electrical energy from the same sources for industrial and manufacturing purposes. The installed capacity of the plant is 6,000 K.W. The output for year ending 31st March, 1923, was 27,273,880 units.

Other towns with electrical installations for street and private lighting are Auckland, Whangarei, Rotorua, Napier, Hastings, New Plymouth, Stratford, Inglewood, Hawera, Patea, Reefton, Ross, Christchurch, Timaru, Gore, Mataura, Hamilton, Te Aroha, Waitara, Eketahuna, Feilding, Tauranga, Gisborne, Winton, Ashburton, Bluff, Ohakune, Taihape, Mangaweka, Oamaru, Te Kuiti, Bulls, Wellington, Huntly, Kaponga, Martinborough, Ngaruawahia Opotiki, Pahiatua, Pukekohe, Raetihi, Thames, Paeroa, Devonport, Kaioura, Fairlie, Motueka, Murdochson, Tamakiwest, Havelock North, Milton, Cambridge, Morrinsville, Te Puke, Richmond, Wakefield, Wairoa, Waiuku, Waverley, Akaroa, Brightwater, Lyttelton, Rangiora, Kaiapoi, Havellock, Invercargill, Hokitika, Picton, Kaikangate, Outram, Mosgiel, Te Awamutu, and Wanganui.

The total installed power in the Dominion, from all sources amounts to 57,589 kilowatt, and involves a total capital outlay of $6,406,482. The number of units sold in the year ended 31st March, 1923, amounted to 163,284,390.

The coasts of the Dominion are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Gisborne, Wairoa, Napier, Wanganui, Patea, New Plymouth, Waitara, Nelson, Westport, Greymouth, Hokitika, Wairau, Lyttelton, Timaru, Oamaru, and Dunedin. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

Road and railway formation works are carried out under small contracts and by the co-operative system, under which the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of labourers and artisans at rates fixed by Government officers on the ground. These rates are calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 16s. to 18s. per day for artisans, and from 13s. to 14s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day. Buildings and large bridges are built by contract, let after inviting tenders through the press.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England and Europe and with Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States and Canada.

Postage Rates.

The postage on letters inland is 1d. for the first ounce or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each additional ounce or fraction thereof, and to such places as accept matter at the reduced rate, 1d. for the first ounce or fraction thereof, and 1d. for each additional ounce or fraction thereof. The reduced rate applies in any case to British possessions, and to a number of foreign countries. The letter postage to other places beyond New Zealand is 2½d. for the first ounce, and 1½d. for each succeeding ounce, or fraction thereof. The inland rate for newspapers is ½d. each. The minimum rate for newspapers printed and published in New Zealand, for the United Kingdom, is 1d. for each newspaper, irrespective of weight, but subject to certain conditions as to despatch. The ordinary rate for Australia and New Guinea (except Dutch New Guinea) and certain other British possessions is 1d. for each newspaper. The rate for newspapers for other places, and for newspapers not printed and published in New Zealand addressed to the United Kingdom, is for each newspaper:—1½d. for the first 4 ounces, and ½d. for each additional 2 ounces or fraction thereof. The inland parcel post rates are:—6½d. for the first lb. and 2½d. for each additional lb. up to 10 lbs., and 1½d. for each additional lb. up to 28 lbs. The postage rates applicable to an 11 lb. parcel are charged on all parcels (except parcels containing fishing rods, golf clubs or similar articles) that weigh less than 11 lb. if such parcels exceed 4 ft. length and girth combined. A fragile fee is charged on all inland parcels which the senders desire forwarded to destination in hampers, the fee being 9d. in cases where length and girth combined exceed 4 ft., and when parcels, not exceeding 1 in. in thickness, exceed 4 ft. in length and width combined. In all other cases the fee is 6d.
