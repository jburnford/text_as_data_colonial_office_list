**THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.**

A British Protectorate was proclaimed over the Gilbert Islands by Commanding Officer H. M. Davis of H.M.S. "Royalist" on behalf of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, at Abemama, on the 27th May, 1892. The Ellice Islands were declared a Protectorate in September of the same year.

The jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Protectorates was extended to Ocean Island by the hoisting of the Flag thereon on the 28th September, 1901.

By the expressed desire of the Native Governments of these islands, the first two groups were annexed to and formed part of His Majesty's Dominions by an Order in Council of the 10th November, 1915, and were known as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony as from the 12th January, 1916. Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands were included within the boundaries of the Colony by an Order of His Majesty in Council of the 27th January, 1916, which came into operation on the 3rd April of that year.

The Union group of Islands was brought in by Order in Council of the 29th February, 1916, operating from the 6th May, 1916.

Christmas Island was also included in the Colony by Order in Council of the 30th July, 1919, taking effect from the 10th November, 1919.

The total population of the Colony at the Census of April, 1921, was 29,897, of whom 264 were Europeans, 348 Asiatics, and 29,285 Pacific Island natives. The first included 74 females, and the last 14,206.

Ocean Island (Paanopa or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 38' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. The total population of Ocean Island in 1921 was 1,785. Of these 115 were Europeans, 80 of whom were men and 65 of this latter number employees of the British Phosphate Commission. The natives totalled 1,356, of these 546 being Banabans and 672 representing the Gilbertese employees of the British Phosphate Commission. Besides this labour force, the Commission recruit men from China, of whom there were 312 at Ocean Island at the 1921 Census.

The Wireless Station at Ocean Island was opened for traffic on the 14th March, 1916. A public service via Suvaradio to all parts of the world was inaugurated on the 16th August, 1922. As a direct result of this a new and cheaper rate to Ocean Island from Australia via Rabaul came into operation on the 1st January, 1923.

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE GROUPS.** — The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:— Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Kuria, Aranuka and Abemama (Northern Gilberts); Nonouti and Tabiteua (Central Gilberts); Onotoa, Beru, Nukunau, Tamana and Aroré (Southern Gilberts). The Ellice Islands are the following nine:— Nanumale, Nanumaga, Nuiatua, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Naurakita.

The two groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 10° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude with an area of 180 square miles. The principal export is copra.

The total population of the Gilbert Group at the 1921 census was 23,318. Of these, 75 were Europeans, 23 Asiatics and 23,220 natives, of whom 11,791 were males.
The population of the Ellice Group was 3,457, 22 of whom were Europeans, 6 Asiatics, 3,429 natives, 1,706 of the last being males.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate. A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials. Revenue is obtained from a land, or copra, tax, trading licences, import duties, non-native capitation tax, etc., which covers the cost of maintaining a regular government. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.

The Union Group.—The three coral atolls of Atafu, Nukunono and Fakaofo, lying about 9° S. latitude and 170° W. longitude, comprise the Union Group, with a population of 989 natives, 498 of whom were males. The language is closely allied to that of the Ellice Group. Nearly all the natives are adherents of the London Missionary Society or of the Roman Catholic Samoan Mission. Copra is the only export. Native Governments have been established as in the Gilbert and Ellice Groups. A District Officer supervises the Ellice and Union Groups, but communication between them is limited to about three calls a year.

Fanning and Washington Islands lie about 3° 51' N. latitude, and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but "Fanning Island Limited" recruit labour from the Gilbert Islands for their copra industry. There were 102 of these at the 1921 Census. A District Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 50. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel of the Fanning Island Company.

Christmas Island (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. Messrs Waltons and Company are their London Agents, and the Rev. E. Rougier, of Papeete, Tahiti, Lessee and Governing Director. The population in 1920, was 37, 15 of whom were Europeans and the remainder Tahitians. In 1922 there were four Europeans and 28 Tahitians. Up to the present time, the port of entry for Christmas Island is Fanning Island, so that all inward entries and outward clearances must be made at the latter port. All taxation imposed in the Colony is applicable to Christmas Island.

The first visit of inspection by a District Officer since its inclusion within the Colony was made in March, 1922, in H.M.S. "Calcutta." There is a road about 60 miles in length, and the Company owns two Ford motor-cars which are in use. There are said to be 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts, with 75 trees to the acre. There are no postal arrangements, the only mails that reach the island being carried by the ships chartered by Mr. Rougier in Tahiti.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital. Communication between the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and Ocean Island previously dependent on the infrequent movements of vessels of Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, Limited, the Samos Shipping and Trading Company, Limited, and On Chong and Company has improved with the acquisition from the Fiji Government of H.M.C.S. "Ranadi."

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ongtong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 160,000, but is decreasing. Large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, but dysentery and fighting among its inhabitants has greatly reduced the numbers. The natives have been described as treacherous; some tribes are still head-hunters and cannibals. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philp and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in December, 1921, amounted to 40,000 acres. The non-native population in 1914 numbered 660 Europeans, in 1919 numbered 675 Europeans and 75 Asiatics, in 1922, 493 Europeans and 90 Foreigners. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The headquarters of the Protectorate is at Tulagi, a small island off Florida. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, Mala, Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal and Ysabel. There regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, with an area of about 250 square miles, are situated between the 20th and 23rd degrees of south latitude. Most of the islands are of coral formation, but some are active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand and Samoa. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. There is regular steam communication with Auckland via Fiji (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles).

Census of Population, April, 1921:

| Category     | Number |
|--------------|--------|
| Tongans      | 22,680 |
| Europeans    | 571    |
| Half-castes  | 235    |
| Others       | 247    |
| **Total**    | **23,733** |

The late king George Tubou I was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga. The queen is assisted by a parliament and a privy council. The Privy Council is composed of four European and five Native Ministers of the Crown who are also heads of the various government departments. The civil service is composed mostly of Pagans, the European officials numbering about 37. The tariff resembles that of Fiji and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades.

The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are five churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents; the "Free Church of England," the number of whose adherents is unknown; and the Church of England. The Free Church of Tonga was established in 1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakaogo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan missionary. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos" or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaogo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufashau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917, to Prince
Uiliami Tugi, the present Premier, and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection, whereupon a protectorate was proclaimed.

In December, 1904, and January, 1905, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard im Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder, and receiving an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him under the Treaty of 1890. The Premier, Jioateki Toga, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jione Mataialona was appointed to the Premiership, which office he held until 30th September, 1912, when he resigned. He was succeeded by Tevita Tuivakano, who retired from office on 30th June, 1922. The present premier, Uliame Tugi, is the Prince Consort, and was formerly Minister for Lands. The progress of Tonga since 1906 has been satisfactory.

Every Tongan is entitled to an allotment of land for cultivation, so that no unemployment exists.

There is a complete and efficient system of elementary and secondary education. Medical work is well organised; and, unlike most native communities in the Pacific, the native population steadily increases in number.

British and foreign subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine, and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 sq. miles.

The population in 1923 was estimated at—

| Natives | 58,700 |
| Europeans | 950 |
| Asiatic, etc. | 360 |
| Total | 60,010 |

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church.

The principal exports are copra, maize, and coffee; timber, cotton and sulphur are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent.

At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914 to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 18th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers have been appointed.

The Islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to the Samoa Shipping and Trading Company for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (26° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1806, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population in 1914 was 140 (35 adult males, 39 adult females, 66 children).

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1896 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, Parkin Christian.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.

NAURU.

Nauru (0° 26' S., 166° 56' E.), or Pleasant Island, an uplifted atoll, was discovered by Captain Fearn in 1798, and was annexed by Germany in 1888. It has an area of about eight square miles, and a native population of 1,400. A number of Chinese are employed in working the great deposits of phosphate-rock, which, under an Agreement dated 2nd July, 1919, will be exploited jointly by the Imperial Government and the Governments of Australia and New Zealand. Coconuts are extensively cultivated. A wireless station is in operation.

Nauru was surrendered to H.M.A.S. "Melbourne" in November, 1914, and, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, was administered under the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific until June 10th, 1921. A mandate conferred by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers on the British Empire to administer Nauru was approved by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920. In accordance with the agreement set forth in the Nauru Island Agreement Act, 1920, the administration is at present entrusted to an administrator appointed by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. Administrator, Brigadier-General Griffiths.
