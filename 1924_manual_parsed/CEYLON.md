CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 50' N. lat. and 79° 42' and 81° 53' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 270 miles; its greatest width 140 miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangamankanda on the east. Its area is 25,332 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldives Archipelago, 400 miles south-west of Ceylon, made up of 18 groups—known as atolls—of islets, which are sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coconut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population enumerated at the census 1921 was 70,413, including 137 Indian Borahs, 22 Malayalees, and 58 Ceylon Moors who were at Malé Island for purposes of trade; the principal occupations are fishing (14,760 males), coir and lace making (10,799 females and 13 males), toddy drawing (1,273 males), carpentry (1,133 males), and cultivation (883 males and 572 females). Malé, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference. It is the residence of the Sultan and the capital of the Islands.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate of Ceylon for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustan.

Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 81° F., and a noteworthy feature is the smallness of the variation both between day and night in the same twenty-four hours, and between the different parts of the year. At Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level the mean temperature is 76° F., and the rule of 1° F. drop in temperature for each 300 feet rise in altitude holds fairly well throughout the island.

At Colombo and Galle the mean monthly temperature in the coldest months (December and January) is less than four degrees below those in the warmest months (April and May), while the mean daily ranges for the year are 12·3° and 7·4° respectively.

At Trincomalee, on the other side of the island, conditions are only slightly more varied. The mean monthly temperature in May (86° F.) is seven degrees above that in December (79° F.), while the mean daily range for the year is 13·7° F.

It must be remembered, however, that the change in the capacity of the air for moisture for each degree of change of temperature in the Ceylon low country is far greater than the corresponding change per degree at the mean temperature of London.

The highest temperatures are experienced in the district to the north of the hills, and to the north-east, but it is only in a very few days in the year that a temperature of 100° Fahr. or over is experienced. Trincomalee holds the record with 103·7° Fahr. In the hills there is of course a great variety of climate, and at Nuwara Eliya, about 6,000 feet above mean sea level, frost is occasionally recorded in the early part of the year.

The annual average rainfall varies from below 40 inches in the dry zones to the north-west and south-east of the Island to above 200 inches at certain places on the south-west slopes of the hills. The chief rainy seasons extend from April to June and from October to January, but as there is a sharp antithesis between the windward and lee side during both monsoons (particularly the S.W.), it is hard to summarise the island as a whole in one sentence. It may fairly be said that there is not a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.

History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.
In the sixteenth century the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1796 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1802, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The present constitution of these Councils was settled by the Ceylon (Legislative Council) Order in Council 1920, and by Letters Patent and Instructions issued in the same year. The Executive Council consists of three ex-officio members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, The Attorney General, and the Government Agent for the Western Province, and four other members, of whom three are unofficials. The Legislative Council consists of 37 members, including five ex-officio members, viz., the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Controller of Revenue and the Treasurer, nine nominated official and three nominated unofficial members, one Mohammedan member, two Kandyan members and one Indian member (these four members are at present nominated, but the Order in Council provides that they may in future be appointed by election) and 16 elected unofficial members.

Of the elected members, five represent special interests and communities, viz., the European Electorate (Urban), the European Electorate (Rural), the Commercial Electorate, the Burgher Electorate, and the Low-country Products Association Electorate, and 11 represent territorial constituencies, viz., the Town of Colombo, the two Divisions of the Western Province, and the eight other Provinces.

The nine Provinces are presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

According to the decennial census, taken on the 18th March, 1921, the population was 4,504,549, an increase of 9½ per cent. on the population enumerated in 1911. The details of the population were as follows (including the military, shipping, estates and miscellaneous):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 1,251,639  |
| Central ditto             | 717,739    |
| Southern ditto            | 671,358    |
| Northern ditto            | 375,462    |
| Eastern ditto             | 192,947    |
| North-Western Province    | 492,287    |
| North-Central ditto       | 96,525     |
| Province of Uva           | 234,027    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa  | 471,814    |
| Miscellaneous             | 751        |

Total 4,504,549

Among these were 8,937 Europeans, 29,532 Burghers and Eurasians, 3,016,659 Sinhalese, 1,121,018 Tamils, 285,876 Moors, 13,461 Malays, and 29,066 persons of other nationalities. The Buddhists (2,770,391) numbered more than half the population, there were 982,733 Hindus, 445,015 Christians (mostly Roman Catholic), 303,863 Mohammedans, and 2,547 other religions. The population of the principal towns was as follows:

- Colombo, 248,824
- Negombo, 21,349
- Moratuwa, 28,608
- Kalutara, 13,596
- Kandy, 32,562
- Jaffna, 42,511
- Galle, 39,157
- Matara, 16,779
- Batticaloa, 10,646
- Trincomalee, 9,442
- Kurunegala, 10,187
- Badulla, 8,126

The number of Indian coolies on the tea estates, etc., was about 500,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, was estimated at 569,000.

The entire area of the Colony is 25,332 square miles. About one quarter of this area, after deducting backwaters, etc., is under cultivation. Some 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,292 feet above the sea level. The approximate acreages under the most important products are:

| Product         | Acres   |
|-----------------|---------|
| Coconuts        | 900,000 |
| Rice            | 820,000 |
| Tea             | 418,000 |
| Grain (other than Rice) | 120,000 |
| Rubber          | 390,000 |
| Cinnamon        | 25,000  |
| Cacao           | 33,200  |
| Tobacco         | 13,000  |

At the end of 1922, the number of plumbago mines reported to be working was 16. The amount of plumbago exported during the year was 217,000 cwts. valued at rs. 1,631,087.

The minimum upset price of Crown land is rs. 16 per acre. 14,977 acres were sold in 1922 at an average price of rs. 51 per acre.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack and Toddy Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt for the financial year 1921-22 was rs. 1,521,635-48. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed on an import duty of rs. 3 per cwt.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement and Urban District Councils which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton, Dickoya, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradapura, Badulla, Bandarawela, Rathnapura, Kegalla, Moratuwa, and Jaffna and by Ganabhwas amounted in 1922 to rs. 9,442,190-77. The revenue collected by the Sanitary Boards amounted to rs. 743,155-46.

The municipal debt on 31st Dec., 1922, was rs. 14,248,762-68. Of this amount rs. 10,960,866-68 were borrowed from the Government for the Colombo Drainage Works, and rs. 2,929,625 for Water Works. Rs. 226,765-64 is the balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle for the construction of waterworks and sanitary improvements, and rs. 91,509-96 is the balance due from the municipality of Kandy for waterworks and drainage.
The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1900, 149,264,602 lbs.; 1922, 171,808,000 lbs.

There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. On the failure of coffee planters preferred to substitute cinchona and tea. Cinchona however did not survive low prices and was replaced by tea. Within recent years great attention has been given to rubber. In 1898 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber, in 1901 there were 2,500 acres, in 1904 11,000 acres, in 1905 40,000 acres, in 1906 100,000 acres, in 1908 180,000 acres, in 1911 about 215,000 acres, in 1920 about 405,000 acres, and in 1922 about 390,000 acres under this product.

The value of the products of the coconut palm exported in 1922 was rs. 86,539,621. During the past few years greater attention has been given to the cultivation of coconuts, and large areas of land formerly occupied with cinnamon are now planted in this crop. The value of cacao exported in 1922 was rs. 3,145,386 and of cinnamon, rs. 1,992,677. Of the total exports that portion going to the United Kingdom was valued at rs. 137,770,062 that to British possessions valued at rs. 48,732,699, and that to foreign countries at rs. 111,280,454.

The chief imports are rice from India, valued at rs. 87,403,142 in 1922, coal from India and textiles from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. Kandyan law and Mohammedan law also prevail among Kandyans and Mohammedians respectively. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of minor criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases. In addition to these there are the Gansabawas, Village Councils, and Village Tribunals, instituted under the Ordinance No. 24 of 1889, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked well and are thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people. Besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, they have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1922 was 152,675 in schools aided by Government 264,466, and in unaided schools 21,322.

The total expenditure on account of the Education Department was rs. 4,156,072'44. In 1868, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure rs. 161,660. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Education and the adoption of a system under which the educational wants of the Island are met partly by Government, partly by schools receiving grants in aid from Government. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; fees are charged for English teaching.

The only Secondary School entirely supported by Government is the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-aid Secondary Schools. Three Government scholarships, each of £350 per annum for two years (extended in certain special cases to three years), to be spent at English universities, are awarded annually, on the results of the B.A. and B.Sc. Examinations of the University of London.

An industrial education is provided at Government and Grant-in-aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are 86. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893; its title has since been changed to "Government Technical Schools."

A University College was opened in Colombo in January, 1921, when lectures were started in the following subjects:—English Language and Literature, Classics and Philosophy, Modern History and Economics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Sanskrit and Pali, Tamil, Sinhalese, Botany, Zoology, Geology, Geography, Education.

The Science Block was opened on 1st October, 1921.

A Government Training College for Masters and Mistresses in English Schools and Government Vernacular Schools was opened in 1903.

Medical Institutions.

Medical College.—The Ceylon Medical College was founded in 1870 to provide a course of Medical training for the natives of Ceylon. The curriculum is a full five years' course, and since 1887 the Licence of the College has been recognised by the General Medical Council as a registrable Colonial qualification. The courses of instruction and examinations are also recognised by many of the British Examining Boards. The licence has been conferred upon 384 candidates since the College was opened; of recent years about 18 qualify annually.

There is a Junior or Apothecary Department in which students go through a two years' course, and after passing the prescribed examinations are qualified to serve as Apothecaries.

The College has a staff of over 30 lecturers and is managed by a Council incorporated by law, which is also the Medical Registration Authority for the Colony.

There are at present about 203 students.

Owing to changes introduced by the Medical Council of Great Britain, the preliminary subjects, Physics, Chemistry and Biology, are now pre-medical subjects, and arrangements have been made for these to be studied at the University College. Students must pass an examination in these subjects before they can be admitted to the Medical College for their purely medical studies.

The Government maintains 87 hospitals, exclusive of 22 infectious disease hospitals, 17 jai
hospitals, and four asylums, two for lunatics of 617 and 150 beds respectively, and the other two for lepers of 570 beds.

There are special institutions for diseases of women and children, and for the eye, ear and throat. There is a Bacteriological and also a Pasteur Institute. There are 485 dispensaries, 80 of which are attached to hospitals, the remaining 405 are institutions independent of hospitals. In addition there are over 500 private estate dispensaries and 68 estate hospitals which receive free drugs from the Government.

The Ceylon Civil Medical Department includes 94 medical officers with licences in medicine and surgery granted by the Ceylon Medical College. There are two institutions where nurses are trained, and the nursing staff consists of 34 European qualified matrons and sisters, 84 European Roman Catholic sisters, 228 matrons and nurses trained locally, and pupils in training.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1921-22 to rs. 5,597,279-68. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 1,044,741-15 for 1921-22. The receipts, which included cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, etc., amounted to rs. 364,566-16 for 1921-22. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estates Branch of the Department yielded rs. 1,016,805-72 for 1921-22.

The Medical College fees amounted to rs. 31,157 in 1922-23.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, sovereigns having ceased to be legal tender in the Colony from the 7th day of August, 1920. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pice. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 30th September, 1923, was rs. 39,704,944. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Imperial Bank of India; National Bank of India, Limited; Eastern Bank, Limited; P. & O. Banking Corporation, Ltd. None of these now issues notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885. On 31st December, 1922, the deposits were: Ceylon Savings Bank, rs. 4,619,561; Post Office Savings Bank, rs. 5,584,403.

The Colombo Harbour.

A body designated the Colombo Port Commission was established on the 1st July, 1913, to administer the affairs of the Port of Colombo. The Commission is responsible for the efficient working of the Port, and has powers of executive action and initiative. It is composed of six official members, six unofficial members, and a secretary. The official members are the Principal Collector of Customs (Chairman), the Principal Civil Medical Officer, the General Manager of the Railway, the Deputy Collector of Customs, the Master Attendant, and the Harbour Engineer. Five of the unofficial members are nominated by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and the sixth (representative of the native interests of the Port) by the Governor. It is proposed to add a sixth unofficial member (to be nominated by the Chamber of Commerce), and also the Chairman of the Municipal Council.

The Harbour Works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, commenced in 1873, and completed in 1886, at a cost of 705,207l., is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction North by East. It is built of concrete blocks weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.

The North-East and North-West breakwaters were commenced in 1894, and completed in 1906, at a total cost of 500,000l. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging.

The North-West breakwater is an island work, 2,667 feet in length, running between the two shore breakwaters, leaving a southern entrance of 800 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 640 acres, or one square mile.

An extension of the S.W. breakwater, starting from a point 3,150 feet from the shore end, was commenced in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1912. The arm is 1,800 feet long, and runs in a direction almost due north, protecting the present main entrance from the S.W. Monsoon seas. The cost of this additional arm was 380,000l.

The Graving Dock. A Graving Dock was commenced in 1899, and was completed in 1906. It is 700 feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost was about 400,000l. There is also a guide pier, 800 feet long, to assist vessels entering the dock.

The Patent Slip was commenced in 1899, and opened on the 1st January, 1903, the cost being 45,000l. It is 800 feet long, the cradle being 220 feet, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

The Coaling Depot consists of 24 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 18 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, stacking, and shipping of coal.

The total cost of the Reclamation and Jetties amounts to about 163,000l.

The Fishery Harbour has been constructed to the northward of Colombo harbour for the use of the fishermen as a beaching ground, the whole of the foreshore inside Colombo harbour having been covered up by reclamation work. The fishery harbour consists of a rubble breakwater running out from the shore in a curve for 800 feet, the sheltered part forming a natural beaching ground for fishing canoes. The cost was approximately 12,000l.

The total expenditure on the Colombo harbour from 1873, when the first breakwater was commenced, to 30th June, 1913, when the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the harbour, was rs. 44,790,267-34, or 2,986,018l., taking the value of the rupee at 1s. 4d.

In the period 1st July, 1913, to 30th September, 1922, a sum of rs. 18,590,971-34 or 1,105,384l., has been spent on various development and maintenance works by the Colombo Port Com-
mission, and a sum of Rs. 1,917,170-67 or 127,811/- by the Public Works Department, making a total of Rs. 18,498,142-51 or 1,233,209/-.

During the past ten years since the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the Port, many improvements have been carried out, and the facilities on shore have much increased; the warehouse accommodation which in 1913 was 291,600 sq. ft. is now 583,633 sq. ft., and the quayage has been increased from 4,645 lineal ft. to 10,336 lineal ft. in the corresponding period. The programme of deepening the harbour to provide for large ships on the Eastern route is being rapidly pursued.

An Oil Installations Depot, 91 acres in extent, about 3½ miles inland from the harbour frontage, has been prepared for the Oil Companies' storage tanks, with pipe line connection from the harbour for fuel oil, kerosine and benzine imported in bulk. There is also a Measuring Tanks Depot (19 acres in extent) at Bloemondahl, about three-quarters of a mile from the Harbour. Three reinforced concrete jetties, two for bunkering vessels and one for discharge of oil tankers, have been provided, the former capable of accommodating vessels up to 500 feet long and 30 feet draught, the latter for vessels of similar length, but of 28 feet draught. The work was commenced in December, 1917, and the expenditure on the scheme up to 30th September, 1922, was Rs. 4,624,673. The oil scheme is now fully working.

A scheme for the development of the Colombo Lake by partially reclaiming it and connecting it to the harbour, estimated to cost about Rs. 8,718,345, is nearing completion. The Lake to Harbour Canal and one-third of the Lakeside Warehouses have been completed and taken over by the Colombo Port Commission.

**Colombo Water Supply.**

The Colombo Water supply is obtained from Labugama Reservoir which is situated in the Western Province, at a distance of 28½ miles from the City.

The Reservoir was formed by impounding the waters of the Wak-Oya, a tributary of the Kelani Ganga.

The Catchment area, which is 2,500 acres in extent, is free from any habitation or cultivation, all the land to the summit of the water shed having been reserved together with a strip two chains in depth along the adjacent water sheds.

The area of the reservoir at present top water level is 176 acres. This lake, the scenery of which is very charming, is 360 feet above sea level and has a maximum depth of 60 feet.

A scheme for raising the height of the reservoir dam by 10 feet is now being carried out at a cost of Rs. 351,000.

This will increase the storage capacity of the reservoir from 1,235 million gallons to 1,745 million gallons, or about 42 per cent more than its present capacity.

Filtration works of the "Jewell Gravity" type are situated immediately below the Reservoir Dam.

Owing to increasing consumption of water in the City, a scheme for extension of the Filtration Plant is under consideration. The water has a very low alkalinity and is remarkably pure.

It is conveyed to the two service Reservoirs in Colombo through three separate pipe lines; two of these are of cast iron each 20 inches in diameter, and the other of steel 30 inches in diameter.

There are some 250 miles of supply and distribution mains, varying in size from 30 to 3 inches in diameter. Water service is available to all premises within the City and also to shipping in Colombo Harbour.

The average daily consumption is estimated at 10 million gallons, and equals about 30 gallons per head of population.

**Railways.**

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:—Broad Gauge (5ft. 6in.), Colombo to Demodera (172¾ miles), Polgahawela to Kankesanturai (212¼ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21¼ miles), Ragama Junction to Mahara Quarry (1¼ miles), Colombo to Matare (98¼ miles), Ragama to Chilaw (41¾ miles), Fort Junction to Wharf (1¼ miles), Madawachi to Talaimannar Pier (66 miles), Kolonnawa Oil Line (1 mile). Narrow Gauge (2ft. 6in.), Colombo Fort to Yatiyantota (49¼ miles), Avisawella to Opanaike (48¼ miles), Nanu Oya to Ragalla (19¼ miles).

Total mileage 732¾ miles. The total cost of construction up to 30th Sept., 1922, charged in account was Rs. 152,750,716. The receipts for the 13 months ended 30th Sept., 1922, were Rs. 21,923,238, and expenditurers, 14,688,972.

The following new lines are under construction viz.:

Broad Gauge, Demodera to Badulla, 9 miles.

Chilaw to Puttalam, 33 miles.

Light Railways, Maho to Batticaloa, 131¼ miles.

Galoya to Trincomalee, 43½ miles.

By the completion of the Talaimannar extension the railway systems of India and Ceylon were brought within 20 miles of one another, the intervening distance being covered by steamers of the South Indian Railway Co., which ply between Dhanuskodi (the Indian Port) and Talaimannar (the Ceylon Port). The other extensions are for the better transport of planting produce (tea, rubber, coconuts, etc.).

**Roads.**

Of metalled roads there are 3,474 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 384 and 236 miles respectively; of canals 143½ miles. The maintenance of 4,094 miles of road cost, in 1922, Rs. 4,160,376, or an average rate of Rs. 1,016 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the towns of Colombo, Kandy, Galle and other principal towns) by way of commutation. The Road Committees collect the commutation. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new waterworks.

**Telephones.**

The Government telephone system comprises an exchange at Colombo (2,238 subscribers), in trunk communication with exchanges at Kandy (154 subscribers), Nuwara Eliya (118 subscribers), Galle (80 subscribers), and smaller exchanges at Avissawella, Beruwela, Bandarawela, Diyatalawa,
Hatton, Gampola, Haputale, Kalutara, Kelaniya, Kegalla, Kochchikade, Kotte, Kurunegala, Nawalapitiya, Negombo, Matale, Matara, Paiyagala, Panadura, Peradeniya, Polgahawela, Moratuwa, Watagoda, Wattala, Wattigama, Ragama and Ratnapura; and also purely local exchanges at Anuradhapura, and Trincomalee. There are, in addition, 80 licensed private systems of various sizes, several of which are connected by means of junction lines and subsidiary trunks with one another and the main trunk lines. The mileage of telephone wire in the Government system is estimated at 2,487 (aerial) and 12,624 (underground).

Telegraphs.

Nearly all parts of the island are served by the Government telegraph system, which has 216 offices working, inclusive of Railway offices open for postal telegrams. The system comprises 2,369 miles of line and 7,123 miles of wire. Ceylon is in direct telegraphic communication with India by a cable which starts from Talaimannar and crosses the Pamban Channel. It is also connected with Europe by a direct cable from Colombo to Aden and with the Far East and Australia by a direct cable to Penang.

There is a Government wireless telegraph station at Colombo having a normal daylight range of about 400 miles, open to traffic of all kinds.

Means of Communication.

In the other weeks mails for Ceylon are brought overland from Bombay. There is also a three-weekly service by the P. & O. line between Bombay and Japan, via Colombo, and a monthly service between London and Calcutta, via Colombo.
