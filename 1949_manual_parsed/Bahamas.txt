BAHAMA ISLANDS

SITUATION AND AREA

The Bahamas are an archipelago of islands, cays and rocks lying between 20° 50' and 27° 25' N. latitude and 72° 37' and 80° 32' W. longitude, and extending from Inagua on the south to Matanilla Reef on the north; from Mayaguana and its adjacent rocks and cays on the east to, and including, the Cay Sal Bank on the west, and separated from Florida, to the west, by the Straits of Florida, and from Cuba, to the south, by the old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

The total area of the colony is 4,403½ square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

CLIMATE

The winter climate is salubrious and most delightful, frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70° F., the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. During the summer months the greatest heat ranges from 80° F. to 90° F., and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating.

The rainfall for the year 1946 amounted to 50-35 inches. Relative humidity for the year was 84%.

The islands are sometimes visited in the autumn months by hurricanes which cause considerable damage to crops and buildings and occasionally loss of life.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The colony consists of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited, and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are, generally, long, narrow and low lying, and the ground is rocky, but the coral rocks contain pockets of rich fertile soil. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, the Biminis, Watling's Island (or San Salvador), Grand Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklins Island, Mayaguana, Andros Island and the Berry Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants is of the negro race, about one-sixth is of European descent. English is universally spoken.

The islands are of coralline formation and contain no mineral wealth. They are sub-tropical and both temperate and tropical trees exist, the pine tree and the palm growing literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.

The soil, except in small pockets, is usually shallow and overlays hard coral rock and is on the whole suitable only for peasant farming.

Nassau, the capital of the colony, is the centre of the tourist traffic, which is of paramount importance in the economic life of the colony. It has a pipe-borne water supply and an up-to-date sewerage system, an ice plant, electric light and automatic telephone systems, a broadcasting station and overseas telephone service.

There are excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists, who visit the colony from the United States and Canada during the winter months. The tourists are attracted by the ideal climate, the clear water and white beaches, the beautiful colouring of the sea and sky, and opportunities afforded for swimming, fishing, boating, etc.

Fish abound in the waters of the colony, and Bimini, which is a centre for sports fishing, is visited by numbers of fishing enthusiasts from the United States.

POPULATION

The estimated population on 31st December, 1947, was 75,018, made up of 35,348 males and 39,670 females.

53,735 (census 1901), 55,944 (census 1911), 55,481 (census 1921), 59,828 (census 1931), 68,846 (census 1943). New Providence contains 29,391 inhabitants according to the 1943 census.

The following table shows the area and population of each of the principal islands of the colony according to the last census taken on 25th April, 1943:

RELIGION

There is no state religion, the Church of England having been disestablished in 1869. The religions with the largest number of followers are the Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists and Roman Catholics.

HISTORY

San Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling’s Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had any settlements on any of the islands of this group at any time. Early in the 17th century the islands were well known to the settlers of Bermuda and the Carolinas. They were included in the Royal Grant of Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney-General of England, of the 30th of October, 1629. By 1640 the islands had become a well-known place of resort by the inhabitants of Bermuda, and on the 9th of July, 1647, The Company of Eleutherian Adventurers was formed in London for the purpose of making an organised attempt at a systematic colonisation and development of the islands. William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, was the moving spirit of this venture, and associated with him were a number of influential city merchants and members of Parliament. On the 31st of August, 1649, Parliament, on the petition of Sayle and others, passed “An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands,” which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding the Royal Grant to Heath in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles the Second, on the 1st of November, 1670, granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, namely, the Duke of Albermarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Berkley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret and Sir Peter Colleton. Before the Royal Grant of 1670 the inhabitants of the islands had organised the settlement and instituted a form of government which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected Captain John Wentworth as their Governor. Wentworth applied to and received commissions from the Governors of Jamaica. The Lords Proprietors appointed Hugh Wentworth as their first Governor on 24th April, 1671, but he did not take up the appointment. They then confirmed in office John Wentworth, the popularly elected Governor, on the 26th of December, 1671. A regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown on the surrender of their rights by the Lords Proprietors on the 28th October, 1717. Thirteen proprietary governors were appointed between 1671 and 1715. The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica, under the leadership of Thomas Bridges. Bridges was recognised as Governor by the Lords Proprietors on the 12th July, 1688, and the settlement had reached some importance when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards in 1703. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned to New Providence and another proprietary governor was appointed in 1707. But the islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place, and thus accede to the numerous petitions which the inhabitants had been making for several years and also carry out the express wishes of Parliament. Since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but they had been retaken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux before the conclusion of the war, which was brought to an end by the Peace of Versailles, 1783, when the British possession was confirmed. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas Group and received substantial assistance from England, and on the 19th of March, 1787, the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

The Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, and which had often in their early history been claimed both by Bermuda and the Bahamas, were separated from the other Bahamas in 1848, and formed into a distinct presidency, under the government-in-chief of Jamaica.

CONSTITUTION

The present constitution of the Bahamas is similar to those of the North American colonies prior to the War of Independence. The government is modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected Houses of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

“The Eleutherian Adventurers,” who came to the Bahamas from Bermuda after the Parliamentary grant of 1647, brought with them a conception of representative government already established in Bermuda, and the affairs of the infant settlement were managed by a Governor, a Council and an elected Senate. The Charter of 1670 to the Lords Proprietors provided for an elected House of Assembly, and the Constitution, much as it exists to-day, was finally settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. The Bahamas enjoy representative, though not responsible, government. The executive government is in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who has the power of veto, and is advised by an Executive Council. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation are vested by law in the Governor in Council.

The Legislative Council, consisting of nine members nominated by the Crown, was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841.

The House of Assembly is composed of 29 members elected for 15 districts. The qualification for members is possession of real or personal property to the value of £200. The Out Islands seldom return a member of their own community, their 21 representatives being generally inhabitants of New Providence. The qualification for electors is ownership of land to the value of £5 or the occupation of houses of annual rental value of £2 8s., in New Providence, or half that amount in the Out Islands. Women have not the vote. The normal life of the House is seven years, but it may be dissolved at any time by the Governor, as occurred in June, 1928, and in May, 1935. No forms of local government exist.
ADMINISTRATION

The executive government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor aided by an Executive Council not exceeding nine members. In the absence of the Governor the senior member of the Executive Council administers the government.

In addition to the usual government departments in New Providence there are public boards dealing with public works, education, health, pilotage, agricultural and marine products, electrical development, telephones, prisons, industrial school, licensing (liquor and shops) and libraries, which are appointed annually by the Governor, consisting of five members, two of whom are required to be members of the House of Assembly. These boards determine the policy and control the expenditure of the departments concerned, but the work is carried out under the supervision and direction of the head of the department.

In the Out Islands the commissioners administer their respective districts; and annual boards of works and health under their chairmanship are appointed by the Governor.

SOCIAL SERVICES*

Education

There is a government system of elementary education, established in 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1885, and Consolidating Act of 1908. Attendance is compulsory from 6 to 14 years of age. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

There are 80 unsectarian government schools and 41 aided schools, with 12,473 scholars. In addition, there are 43 denominational schools with a total roll of over 3,428 pupils and private schools with over 386 pupils.

The government elementary schools were made free in 1885. Higher education is provided at Queen's College, St. Francis Xavier's Academy, the Government High School, and St. Augustine's Boys School, all in Nassau.

Information

Broadcasting

At a Broadcasting Conference in Washington in February the classification of the broadcasting station and the frequency of operation were altered. The frequency of 640 kcs., which had been previously shared with a station at Los Angeles, had to be relinquished in favour of the frequency of 1,540 kcs., in view of the claims to the use of 640 kcs. by a Cuban broadcasting station. At the same time the Nassau broadcasting station, which had previously been recognised as adherent to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, was granted the classification of a Class I-A clear channel dominant station on the new frequency of 1,540 kcs., and in accordance with the engineering limits laid down under the Agreement must receive protection from interference according to the North American Regional Broadcasting standards. The change to the new frequency was carried out in June, and operation has proved to be satisfactory. The Bahamas is now signatory to the North American Regional Agreement, and, as such, is entitled to consideration in any future discussions regarding the use of radio frequencies in the standard broadcast band. This is a considerable improvement over the previous conditions under which the station operated and gives the Colony the recognition which it should have in view of its proximity to the United States and other countries signatory to the North American Regional Agreement.

A further North American Regional Broadcasting Conference is to be held in Canada in 1948, at which the allocation of frequencies in the North American region will again be reviewed.

There is a Bahamas Government Information Bureau in London.

Health

The medical and public health service is administered by a Health Board.

The medical needs of the colony in New Providence are met by the Bahamas General Hospital, which has a full time resident staff of three doctors, a European matron, three European sisters and a number of native nurses.

The service of the hospital is furnished largely free of charge. There is an outpatient department, a general hospital, a lunatic asylum, infirmary, dental clinic, venereal and gynaecological clinic. There are X-ray and bacteriological laboratories.

In addition to the medical service afforded by the Bahamas General Hospital there are eight private medical practitioners in New Providence.

Labour

There is a Labour Officer appointed by the Governor whose chief functions have, up to the present, been the registering of unemployed and the recruitment of agricultural labourers for work in the United States.

There is a standing Labour Board appointed by the Governor for the purpose of advising on any question arising regarding wages.

Legislation affecting trade unions and workers' compensation was passed in 1943. So far the only trade union is the Bahamas Trades and Labour Union.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

During the war many roads in New Providence were reconditioned by the R.A.F. and most important roads in the island have now been treated with asphalt.

Shipping

With the exception of an irregular service between Nassau and Miami by small local motor vessels, and an occasional freighter from England and Canada, all steamship service to the colony was discontinued as a result of the war.

Freight and passenger services between Bahamas and England, Canada and the United States are being re-established.

Air

Pan American World Airways operated a mail, passenger and express service between Miami and Nassau six days a week up to November, 1945, and a daily service from then on with two or more planes per day from 1st December. In February, 1946, they have operated as many as six planes per day.

* Fuller particulars will be found in the Annual Report of the Colony and the Annual Departmental Reports.
Postal

Parcel post with the United Kingdom (9d. per lb. via New York, Is. 3d. per lb. via Miami), the United States (9d. per lb.), *Canada (6d. per lb. to 10 lb., 10 to 15 lb. 6s. per parcel, 15 to 20 lb., 8s. per parcel), *Bermuda (6d. per lb.), and *Jamaica (6d. per lb.), has been established, and money order agreements have been made with the United States, Canada and Jamaica.

Radio Telephone and Telegraph

During 1946 the radio telegraph circuit to Miami was modernised by the introduction of frequency shift radio teletypewriter operation between Nassau and Miami. This system permits high-speed automatic transmission and reception by direct teletypewriter machines with automatic retransmission at Miami into the Western Union System of the United States.

A marine radio telephone service was introduced providing radio telephone communication over a range of 300 miles enabling vessels suitably equipped to communicate directly into the automatic telephone system of Nassau. Other similar installations have been provided on the islands of Cat Cay and Inagua, thus giving coverage to the whole of the area of the Bahama Islands for private vessels, coastal service vessels and ocean-going liners.

With the conversion of Oakes Field from a military to a civil airport, telecommunications facilities have been provided for airline companies and passengers.

The radio telephone system to the Out Islands has been extended and improved, and plans are being prepared for further extension.

Numerous telecommunications facilities have been provided for oil companies in connection with the oil survey developments.

The radio telephone circuit to Miami was extended for operation during the winter season, and plans have been prepared for the introduction of a second circuit.

Public Finance

In December, 1946, the authorised Public Debt was £245,000, made up of locally raised loans. The total held for repayment was £153,057. The chief liquid assets consist of surplus funds investments in England in trustee securities.

There is neither income tax nor excise duty. The main sources of revenue are customs dues and receipts from fees, post office and public utilities. The general customs duty is 20 per cent. ad valorem plus 5 per cent. ad valorem emergency tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no emergency tax, spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general, and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American trade agreements.

Currency and Banking

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States currency is also generally accepted in the colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government through the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. A total amount of £482,800 of these notes was in circulation on 31st December, 1946. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is a branch bank of the Royal Bank of Canada in Nassau (New Providence).

A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1947, deposited £361,140.

Production and Trade

The commercial relations of the Islands are mainly with the U.S. and Canada. The main exports are tomatoes, crawfish, straw and shell work, and salt; the main imports, foodstuffs, spirits, wine and tobacco. Attempts are being made to increase local food production. In 1946, exports totalled £399,319 (excluding specie) and imports £2,840,576.
