ADEN

ADEN COLONY

SITUATION AND AREA

The Colony of Aden is situated in latitude 12° 47' N. and longitude 45° 10' E. about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia.

The island of Perim in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb and the Kuria Muria Islands, five in number, off the Dhufar coast of Oman, also form part of the colony.

The total area of the Colony, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles, that of Aden proper, 21 square miles, and Little Aden 15 square miles. The flat strip of coast joining the peninsulas is about 39 square miles in extent.

CLIMATE

The climate of Aden Colony is not unhealthy though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. During the south-west monsoon, i.e., in July and August, strong winds prevail which give some relief from the damp airless heat of May, June and September. Sandstorms are apt to occur in the months of May, June, July and August. These come from a northerly direction usually a short time before sunset and are often very intense, though of short duration. The weather during July and August is frequently very hazy, and it is not uncommon for ships to pass quite close to Aden without picking up the land. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent; but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Colony of Aden consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas joined by a flat sandy foreshore. Aden proper is on the south and Little Aden on the west. The peninsulas form the horns of Aden Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. On the west side of the Aden Peninsula is Steamer Point the principal military and port area.

The Aden Peninsula is arid, rocky and of volcanic formation and Jabal Shamman, its summit, is 1,808 feet (551 m.) high. Crater, the main Arab town, is situated five miles from the main port and lies in the crater of the extinct volcano forming the peninsula.

The isthmus is a flat sandy plain, barely three-quarters of a mile wide at its narrowest point near the peninsula, joining the latter with the mainland and containing the colony's principal aerodrome.

Some cultivation occurs at Sheikh Othman, at the base of the isthmus, in a garden under the management of the Township Authority, but except during the cold weather months produce is very limited. There are also privately-owned date gardens there. Hiswa, on the shore of Aden Bay, has groves of toddy palms. Salt is manufactured in large quantities on the flat shores of the bay, by the process of open evaporation.

Perim Island, situated in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, is bare, rocky and flat: its highest point, about a mile northward of its southern extremity, is 214 feet (65 m.) high. The surface of the island is grooved with dry water courses and covered with coarse grass and stunted shrubs, the subsoil being sand and conglomerate coral. It possesses a good small harbour on the southwest side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth, and an emergency landing ground on the north side.

POPULATION

The total population at the time of the census taken in October, 1946, was 80,516 (males, 50,589, females, 29,927).

HISTORY

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. The Aden Peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the island in the same year. It was later reoccupied by the British in January, 1857, and placed under the control of an Assistant to the Political Resident at Aden. In 1929, the manager of the Perim Coal Company was appointed Government Agent, but on the closing down of that company in October, 1936, the Commissioner of Police, Aden, was appointed Administrator of the island. A police detachment is maintained at Perim, and the Administrator makes regular visits from Aden, usually by air.

CONSTITUTION

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden as from 1st April, 1937.
Under the Royal Instructions dated 3rd March, 1937, as subsequently amended by Additional Instructions dated 2nd July, 1940, and dated 3rd July, 1948, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the officers lawfully discharging the functions of Chief Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed by His Majesty by any Instructions or Warrants under His Sign Manual and Signet, or as the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony, appoint in pursuance of instructions from His Majesty through one of His Principal Secretaries of State, or as the Governor may provisionally appoint in the manner provided in the Royal Instructions.

Whenever upon any special occasion the Governor desires to obtain the advice of any person within the Colony relating to affairs therein, he may summon such person, for such special occasion, as an Extraordinary Member of the Council.

Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which was brought into force from 24th October, 1946 a Legislative Council was constituted for the Colony of Aden.

The Council was inaugurated in January, 1947, and consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than four official members and not more than eight unofficial members.

The ex officio members are the senior officer for the time being in and stationed in the Colony in command of His Majesty’s Regular Forces therein (excluding the Governor or officer administering the government of the Colony) and the persons for the time being lawfully discharging the functions of the respective offices of Chief Secretary, Attorney General and Financial Secretary of the Colony.

The official members are persons holding office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the above cited Order, are appointed by Instructions or Warrant under His Majesty’s Sign Manual and Signet, or by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in pursuance of His Majesty’s Instructions through the Secretary of State.

The unofficial members are persons not holding office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony, and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the above cited Order, are appointed by Instructions or Warrant under His Majesty’s Sign Manual and Signet, or by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in pursuance of His Majesty’s Instructions through the Secretary of State.

The Governor of the Colony is also Governor of the Aden Protectorate, which is not administered by the Colony Government. The Governor is empowered and commanded to exercise on His Majesty’s behalf all such powers and jurisdiction as His Majesty now has, or may from time to time be enjoined upon him, in accordance with the Aden Protectorate Order dated 18th March, 1937, as amended by Aden Protectorate (Amendment) Order, 1940 and the Aden Protectorate Royal Instructions dated 24th March, 1937.

ADMINISTRATION

The colony is administered by a Governor, who is also Commander-in-Chief, aided by an Executive Council which at present comprises six members.

Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which came into force on 24th October, 1946 a Legislative Council was established in Aden in January, 1947. There is no one Government for the Aden Protectorate. In each of the Western and Eastern protectorates the Governor is represented by a British agent who deals with the various Rulers and Treaty Chiefs on the basis of treaties concluded with them. The Protectorate includes the island of Socotra.

The administration of justice within the Colony is entrusted to the Supreme Court, a Court of Small Causes for certain specified civil cases and Magistrates courts for criminal cases. Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order in Council, 1947, appeals from the Supreme Court now lie to the Court of Appeal of Eastern Africa, and thence to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

The law of the Protectorate is largely tribal custom, but in certain chiefdoms the Shafai Code of Moslem law (Shari’a) is recognised, especially in the Qu’aiti State of Shehr and Mukalla (Ruler, His Highness Sultan Sir Saleh bin Ghalib al Qu’aiti, K.C.M.G.) which State legislates by published decrees.

Aden is a free port and there is no customs tariff. Excise duty is, however, levied on a specific duty basis on spirits, wines and beer, perfumed spirits, intoxicating and dangerous drugs, tobacco and motor spirit.

Under the Townships Ordinance, 1945, Township Authorities for the towns of Aden and for Sheikh Othman were constituted, and the various municipal operations formerly carried out by the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement now devolve on the Township Authorities.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education in Aden Colony is under the control of the Director of Education. In the Eastern and Western Aden Protectorates it is, in common with other services, under the immediate general guidance of the British Agents. But the Aden Government Department of Education inspects schools within the area, gives such advice and assistance as is required and co-ordinates, in so far as possible, educational development throughout the whole territory.

In the Colony, the Government maintains five boys’ and two girls’ primary schools and one boys’ secondary school. There are in addition five aided primary and two aided secondary schools or sections of schools for boys and two aided primary and two aided secondary schools for girls, as well as several unrecognised schools. In all schools in the Colony there are approximately 2,895 pupils in primary or indigenous schools (including 641 girls), and 1,137 pupils in secondary (including 169 girls). There is no post-secondary education given in the Colony. A number of students are sent abroad on scholarships for further education and a Scholarship Committee has been nominated to investigate and advise the Government on scholarships to be awarded.

Classes for adult females are conducted at the Government Girls’ School. Commercial classes are held at the Government Secondary School and at a privately run commercial institution.
Small committees of parents have been formed for each primary school in substitution of the advisory committee. A teacher training section has now been added to the Government secondary school.

A technical instructor has arrived and is planning the opening of a trade school.

The British Council opened an Institute for men in 1940 and an Institute for women in 1942.

**Information Services**

The Aden Information Office services cover the Colony and Protectorate in respect of which a grant is received from His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom.

These services consist of a system of communiques to the local Aden press, and to the general public; mobile film units, which show newsreels and documentary films to public cinemas, and for free exhibition to clubs, hospitals, barracks and public show in market places (this service will shortly be available to Aden Protectorate); distribution of British, Arab and Indian publications to clubs, merchants' associations, and other interested bodies; exhibitions of posters and photographs and such publicity material of interest to the local population; the provision of copy regarding Aden to Britain and other countries for publication.

Tests are being held in December, 1948, with a view to establishing a broadcasting service to cover the Colony and Protectorate, and the installation of a Rediffusion System, for the Colony only, is under investigation.

Information services are under the District Commissioner as Information Officer, assisted by an Advisory Committee on which the local unofficial opinions of the English, Arab, and Indian communities are represented.

**Health**

There is a Government civil hospital (300 beds) in Crater, and a maternity and child welfare clinic (15 maternity beds and two children's wards of five beds each). There is a hospital of the Keith Falconer Mission at Sheikh Othman (60 beds).

There are two dispensaries organised by charity catering especially for sick poor, and a small Government dispensary at Perim Island.

Public health work is supervised by a Medical Officer of Health under the control of the Director of Medical Services. The infectious diseases hospital (100 beds) is also under his care.

The Port Health Officer is responsible for the out-patient treatment of members of the merchant navies on vessels in port. He is also in charge of routine quarantine administration and the maintenance of Flint Island quarantine station.

**Labour**

There are at present no organised labour services in the Colony, but the District Commissioner is in charge of labour matters, and the Assistant Welfare Officer appointed in 1948, assists in providing liaison between the working classes and the Government. The inhabitants of Aden are principally engaged in trading, shop-keeping and domestic employment. The large number of coolies employed by the salt works, shipping concerns and contractors are drawn from the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen. The small harbour craft are mostly manned by Somalis.

**Welfare**

Prior to 1948, no special provision was made for Welfare Services, but in 1948 an Assistant Welfare Officer was appointed and took up duties under the supervision of the District Commissioner.

His work includes investigation into the background of juvenile offenders who are brought before the Court, assisting towards the organisation of Youth Clubs, and he has also been employed ad hoc on labour investigation in the case of strikes.

The expansion of a Social Services Department is provided for, with the appointment of a full-time Welfare Officer, but no candidate has yet been appointed.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Roads**

Communication between the various townships is by road. The main roads are constructed in bituminous macadam, and average 20 ft. in width. Some secondary roads are similarly constructed, 3-4 miles having been laid down in 1947, but the majority are in water-bound macadam. There are, in addition, some 10 miles of streets in the two townships which have not yet been made up. The mileage of roads in the colony is:

| Bituminous Water-bound Unmade macadam macadam roads Total |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| roads                  | roads           | roads           | Total          |
| miles                  | miles           | miles           | miles          |
| 30·80                  | 10·40           | 18·70           | 59·90          |

**Railways**

There are no railways in Aden.

**Shipping**

The Port, which is administered by a Board of Trustees formed in 1888 under the Aden Port Trust Act of 1888, has been considerably improved in recent years.

The harbour now has 19 first-class berths, 5 second-class berths, and 8 third-class berths suitable for vessels ranging from 300 feet to 700 feet in length. Vessels of greater length can be accommodated if necessary. The approach channel and the major portion of the mooring basin is dredged to 36 feet. There are ten oiling berths, seven on the south side operated by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and three on the north side operated by the Caltex (Aden), Ltd. Oil can be delivered to ships at a rate of up to 800 tons an hour.

The Port Trust owns two powerful tugs and the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company have a large tug of their own which is available to the Port Trust for use in berthing and unberthing vessels. The Port Trust tugs are fitted with fire-fighting apparatus. There are four floating docks, the largest of which can lift 2,000 tons. There are approximately fifteen small privately-owned tugs suitable for lighter work and some 150 lighters for handling cargo and coal. Separate jetties have been constructed for the handling of petroleum and ammunition and there are numerous private and public wharves alongside which lighters can discharge. Shed accommodation is available on some of the wharves and the Port Trust owns sheds at Maalla covering an area of 16,300 sq. yards. The Port Trust has a well-equipped workshop and employs three divers for work in the harbour. Repairs to hull and machinery can be carried out in the workshops of local firms.
The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and during the 12 months ending 30th September, 1948, 3,011 ships called, representing a total tonnage of 12,508,095 tons.

**Air**

There are no internal colony air services. Aden Airways, a B.O.A.C. subsidiary, operates five scheduled services as follows:

1. To Cairo and then onwards to United Kingdom via Djibouti, Kamaran, Asmara, Port Sudan and Jeddah.
2. To Cairo and then onwards to United Kingdom via Asmara, Khartoum.
3. To Nairobi via Hargeisa and Mogadishu.
4. To Addis-Ababa via Djibouti.
5. To Addis-Ababa directly.

Messrs. Clairways, Limited, operate a scheduled service to Nairobi via Hargeisa and Mogadishu. Indian Overseas Airlines make frequent charter flights between Bombay and Nairobi, calling at Aden on both inward and outward journeys.

In addition Aden Airways run a fortnightly service to Riyam (Mukalla) during the monsoon season when dhow traffic is impracticable.

The R.A.F. airfield at Mukheiras on the Audhali platform has been extended to take Dakota aircraft and charter flights are made between Aden and Mukheiras every week by Aden Airways.

**Posts and Telegraphs**

**Mails**

Surface mails between Aden and all parts of the world are exchanged as opportunity offers by fairly frequent, but for the time being irregular, steamship services using the port.

Air mails to and from all parts of the world are exchanged several times weekly by the service operated by the B.O.A.C. between Aden and Cairo, which calls at Kamaran, Asmara and Port Sudan. At Cairo this service connects with the main trunk services of the B.O.A.C. operating between London and South Africa, and between London and India, Malaya and the East, and Australia. Additional air mails are exchanged by B.O.A.C. services twice weekly with Hargeisa (Somaliland) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).

The Ethiopian Air Lines operate a bi-weekly service between Aden–Addis Ababa (or Dire Dawa) and Jibuti.

The Clairways Air Service operate a weekly service between Aden–Nairobi via Hargeisa, Mogadiscio and Kismayo.

**Telephones**

An automatic telephone system serves the whole colony. There are about 966 telephones including those in Government and military offices, either connected directly to the main exchange or through private branch exchanges.

**External Telecommunications**

Cable & Wireless (M.E.), Ltd., are responsible for all external civil communications. They own and operate a cable station from which their submarine cables connect with countries all over the world. They also operate wireless telegraph services from Aden to Mukalla in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and between Aden and Addis Ababa in Abyssinia, Djibouti in French Somaliland, Hargeisa in British Somaliland and Kamaran in the Red Sea.

A cable from Aden connects with Perim whence another cable belonging to the Yemen extends to Sheikh Said, thus linking Perim and the Yemen with all parts of the world through the company’s system.

There is no internal telegraph system.

Currency and Banking

Currency
The monetary unit is the Indian rupee (silver) and is legal tender for any amount.

Banking
The National Bank of India, Ltd., is established in the colony with its chief office in the Crater and a branch at Steamer Point. The Exchange Bank of India and Africa, Ltd., has a branch in Crater. The commercial firm of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw & Bros. also carries on the business of banking.

There is one Savings Bank operated by the Post Office.

Production and Trade

Salt
The principal native product of Aden is salt, made from sea-water by solar evaporation in a series of pans acres in extent. The export in 1947 amounted to 320,770 tons.

This industry is in the hands of four manufacturers, one Italian, now under the management of the Custodian of Enemy Property, the other three Indian owned. The year 1947 showed a considerable improvement in business as compared with the previous two years. This was due to improved shipping which enabled more salt to be marketed in India. The tonnage produced during the year 1947 was 194,549 tons.

Fisheries
The present primitive fishery employs numerous canoes and a few small dhows propelled by oars and sails. Nets are small, as only hand-braided net is available; capital is limited and the life of the twine is short, as no preservatives are used. Only single-hook lines are employed.

An extensive survey of the fisheries resources of the colony and protectorate is at present being carried out under the supervision of the Fisheries Officer and other technical experts. Two vessels have been equipped for this experimental fishing.

Industry
The main industry is the bunkering of ships and the handling of cargo. These activities are in the hands of large firms—the labour employed is almost entirely immigrant Yemeni Arabs who come south for a year or two.

The entrepot trade is in the hands of large merchants, European, Indian, and Arab, who are concerned in the export of hides, skins, coffee, gums, incense and grain and in the import and distribution of all kinds of merchandise, particularly cotton piece-goods, hardware, sugar, spices, and kerosene.

There are some small factories (owned by private companies). The chief are soap works, aluminium pressing of domestic utensils, cutting of button blanks from trochas shell, manufacture of cigarettes and dyeing and printing of cloth. These (with the exception of button blanks) supply the local demand and provide for export to adjoining territories.

Of industries organised among small producers, the principal one is the weaving of cloth, by one-man treadle-operated handlooms. This supplies Aden and adjoining territories. Small crushing plants, with one camel turning a mill, extract sesame oil for cooking purposes.

Aden Protectorate

Situation and Area
The Aden Protectorate, which can be more conveniently described administratively and geographically by dividing it into two areas, the Western and Eastern, has a total superficial area of about 112,000 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the western boundary of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen (whose southern boundary was temporarily stabilised by Article III of the Treaty of Sana’a of 11th February, 1934, by which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of the Yemen agreed to maintain the status quo as on the date of the signature of the treaty), and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. The Aden Protectorate seaboard starts at Hush Murad (opposite Perim) on the west and runs for 740 miles eastwards to Ras Dhurbat Ali where it meets the frontier of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.

Climate
The maritime plains are damp and hot in the summer and are subject to sand storms and high winds. In the winter (October to the end of March) it is cool and sometimes cold at night and much less damp.

In the mountains, which vary in height between 1,500 and 8,000 feet, it is drier and cooler during the day and night above 2,500 feet; and above 4,500 feet it can be very cold.

In the Wadi Hadhramaut and the intervening tableland or “Jol” extremes of both heat and cold are encountered. The heat in contrast to that of the coast is dry but more intense. The rainfall is small.

There is little rainfall in the littoral and maritime hills; here cultivation is chiefly dependent on irrigation from water channels and courses. In the highlands well irrigation is common and there is heavier rainfall which is led down ravines and defiles into terraced fields.

General Description
The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Ruba’ Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys. Some of the valleys are very fertile. The plateau itself is broken up by numerous hills and mountains and is intersected with several deep valleys.
The greater part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate consists of desert and barren mountains intersected by wadis, some of which are fertile and cultivated. There are a number of comparatively large towns, notably Mukalla, the capital of the Qu’aiti State and principal seaport, and Sai’un, the capital of the Kathiri State.

The Western Aden Protectorate consists of the following tribal districts, the chiefs of which are in protective treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government:

- Abdali, His Highness Sultan Fadhl Abdul Karim, Sultan of Lahej, who is the premier chief of the western area.
- Amiri, Amir Nasr bin Shaif Seif, C.M.G. Capital, Dhala.
- Fadhli, Sultan Abdullah bin Uthman. Capital, Shuqra.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate comprises the Hadhramaut (consisting of the Qu’aiti State of Shihir and Mukalla and the Kathiri State of Sai’un), the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra, the Wahidi Sultanates of Bir ’Ali, and the Sheikdoms of Irqa and Haura, all of which have been for many years in protective treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. His Highness Sultan Sir Salih bin Ghalib al Qu’aiti, K.C.M.G., Sultan of Shihir and Mukalla, is the premier chief in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and the Hadhramaut is the most important and best organised of these areas. It is bounded on the west by the Wahidi Sultanates and on the east by the Mahri Sultanate.

The Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra is the most easterly area in the Aden Protectorate, being bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. The Sultan of Qishn and Socotra resides on the island of Socotra, which lies off Africa, 150 miles from Cape Guardafui. The island was occupied by the East India Company in 1834, and it came under British protection, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kuri and Brothers Islands, in 1866, when the treaty with the Mahri Sultan was concluded. Socotra produces aloes, dragons’ blood and ghee. The population is probably about 5,000; the island is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous and the Fidahan Hajr rises to nearly 5,000 feet. The capital is Hadibu, known on European maps as Tamrida.

**POPULATION**

The population of the Aden Protectorate is roughly estimated at 630,000.

**RELIGION**

The people are Muslim Arabs of, almost entirely, the Shafa’i persuasion.

**HISTORY**

For a time in the 18th century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a (capital of the Yemen of today) and several of the rulers of the tribal districts such as the ’Abdali, Haushabi, Amiri, Yafa’i and ’Aulaqi sultans, were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence. This occurred in 1728 in the case of the ’Abdali and in 1758 in the case of the Yafa’i.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the ’Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July, 1915, during the first world war, the Turks, who then held the Yemen, occupied the ’Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts until the armistice of 1918.

In February, 1934, as has been stated, a Treaty of Friendship was signed between His Majesty’s Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower ’Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa’i sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with His Majesty’s Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri sultans and the rise of the Qu’aiti—a dynasty with its origins among the Yafa’i tribes and influence arising from military and other services rendered as emigres to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu’aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with His Majesty’s Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with the other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri sultans made an agreement with the Qu’aiti sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu’aiti and Kathiri sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British Resident Adviser in all matters except those concerning Muhammadan religion and custom. Relations with the smaller states are governed by similar Protectorate treaties.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The interests of the Western Aden Protectorate are looked after by a small cadre of British political officers and Arab assistant political officers under a British Agent, whose headquarters are in Aden. The political staff who are posted to administrative districts inland advise the local rulers on the
administration of their areas, since His Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly.

The tribes nominate their own chiefs who have subsequently to be recognised by the Governor of Aden. Not all the chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery. For internal security some of the chiefs have tribal guards (paid for by His Majesty's Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the British Agent and the chief. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate; they are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Government.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal states, Qu'aiti and Kathiri, are administered by their sultans as constitutional rulers. The Qu'aiti sultan has a state council. The Kathiri State is advancing slowly on the same lines, being hampered by the absence of an outlet to the sea and of the customs dues and other benefits which would result from it. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the British Agent and Resident Adviser, E.A.P.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education in the Aden Protectorate is under the immediate general guidance of the British Agents. The Aden Government Education Department has on its staff a Protectorate Education Officer, who inspects schools and gives advice or assistance where required. Thus, although the Education Department does not directly control Education in the Protectorate it co-ordinates development, as far as possible, throughout the whole area.

The Aden Protectorate College for the Sons of Chiefs, a primary boarding school of limited size, which is situated in the colony, is the only exception to this; it is administered directly by the Department of Education.

The policy has been to encourage the Sultanates to develop their own State Education Departments, and there are now two such in existence. The Qu'aiti State, which is the most advanced, has a Department of Education, seconded from the Sudan, and at Gheli ba Wazir there is an intermediate boarding school with about 120 boys.

The other State which has its own department is Lahej, where there is an intermediate school with about 140 boys.

There is no other primary education in the Protectorate, but plans are being made to establish a secondary boarding school in the Colony, which may be available to Protectorate as well as Colony boys.

The number of primary (or lower than primary) schools which are inspected is now about 50.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, in some departments notably in education and customs administration, there has been much progress. An Educational Assistant to the Resident Adviser, seconded from the Sudan, assists the Mukalla Government in educational matters. There are now over 20 primary schools and an intermediate boarding school for about 160 pupils. Several scholarships have been awarded to promising students to complete their education in the Sudan.

The Government of Aden, in co-operation with the Church of Scotland Mission, has introduced a medical scheme in the Western Aden Protectorate which covers 12 tribal areas and employs 25 dispensers who work in 16 separate dispensaries.

COMMUNICATIONS

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic. The chief of these in the Western Aden Protectorate are:

1. Aden (north and north-westwards) through Lahej to Ta'iz (Yemen) and to Dhala and Qataba (Yemen).
2. Aden westwards to Subaihi country.
3. Aden eastwards to—
   (a) Lower Yafa'.
   (b) Ahwar (Lower 'Aulaqi).
   (c) Fadhli country.
   (d) 'Ahdhali country.
   (e) Dathina.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate considerable progress has been made in recent years in road development, and routes run north of Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhranaut, west to Meifa and Bir Ali, and east as far as Recidat Al Abdul Wadud.

Airfields are maintained by the Royal Air Force for communications of a political nature and for security work. Aden Airways operate a fortnightly service between Aden and Riyan (Mukalla), but it is temporarily suspended. In normal times coastal steamers from Aden and a certain number of larger vessels on the India and the Far East routes call at Mukalla. Both Qu'aiti and Kathiri States belong to the Aden Postal Union and have their own issues of stamps. Cable & Wireless, Ltd., maintain a wireless link between Mukalla Seiyun and Aden and there is a network of political wireless stations in the hinterland.

PUBLIC REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE

As local administrations have but recently been set up it is not yet possible to estimate the revenues of the states in the Western Aden Protectorate.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the revenue of the Qu'aiti State may be roughly estimated at 24 lakhs and expenditure at 23 lakhs of rupees. The principal sources of revenue are customs and excise and licence dues. The finances of the other sultanates have not yet been stabilised. In the Qu'aiti State three lakhs are spent on police and armed constabulary, 2½ lakhs on education, 3 lakhs on the army and 2½ lakhs on public works.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

In the Western Aden Protectorate rupees and riyals (or Maria Theresa dollars) are the currency used, the present (1946) rate of exchange being 2½ rupees to the riyal.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, up to 1944, the Maria Theresa dollar was the currency used throughout the interior but in that year the rupee currency was officially adopted. Maria Theresa dollars, however, remain the normal form of currency in the Wahidi country and vicinity.

There are no banking facilities in the Aden Protectorate.

TRADE, INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE

Trade in the Western Aden Protectorate is chiefly confined to transit trade from the Yemen, from which coffee and skins are exported, but no reliable figures are available. The only industries
are weaving, dyeing and charcoal-burning though some silver work is made by the few small village Jewish communities. Some 10,000 camels bring vegetables, eggs, fodder, and cattle for sale in Aden every month.

Imports into the Western Aden Protectorate include kerosene, soap, ginger, tobacco, rice, flour, tea, sugar and assorted cloths, etc.

Agriculture is the chief occupation of the majority of the tribesmen of the Western Aden Protectorate. Every possible use is made of irrigation and water rights are a frequent cause of tribal feuds.

The staple crops are corn (dhurra), bulrush millet (dukhni) and some Indian corn. Wheat and barley are found at the higher altitude; other crops are sesame and lucerne; some cotton and local indigo (hawir) is also grown. Dates are grown in some areas and coffee in Yafa'. Bananas, papayas, apricots and peaches are found in the 'Abdali and 'Audhali sultanates. Honey is found in small quantities in two or three areas.
