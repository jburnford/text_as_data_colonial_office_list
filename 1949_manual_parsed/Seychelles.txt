SEYCHELLES

Situation and Area

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. latitude 4° and 10°. The total area of the colony and its dependencies is 1564 square miles. The number of islands under the Seychelles Government is 92.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to contain 558 square miles. It has about 105 miles of good roads and paths, and communication between all the districts of the island is easy. It is distant from Mauritius 934, from Madagascar 600, and from Zanzibar 970 miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse (900 acres); Félicité (689 acres); North Island (525 acres); St. Anne (500 acres); Providence (500 acres); Frigate (700 acres); Denis (340 acres); Cerf (290 acres); and Bird or Sea Cow Island (160 acres).

The following islands are also dependencies of Seychelles:—The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. François Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island.

The island of Coëtivy, formerly a dependency of Mauritius, was transferred to Seychelles by Letters Patent in 1907, and Farquhar Island in 1922. There are lighthouses on Denis Island and Manuëles Island (nine miles north-east of Mahé in longitude 55° 32' 20" E., and latitude 4° 29' S.) and in Victoria Harbour. The light on the Capuein Point has been transferred to the Police Point.

CLIMATE

Mahé is healthy and entirely free from malaria. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 84, and falls frequently at night to 72. Records taken on the hills are several degrees lower. The rainfall at Victoria was, in 1947, 84-22 inches. The average over the past 30 years is 96-6 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Mahé rises abruptly from the sea, and the highest peak reaches the elevation of 2,993 feet. Victoria, the capital of the island, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a safe and commodious harbour, provided with a lighthouse showing a white flash of 0-7 second duration every 6-7 seconds.

POPULATION

Census 1901, 19,237; census 1911, 22,691; census 1921, 24,523; census 1931, 27,444; census 1947, 34,632.

The death rate in 1947 was 9-95 per 1,000; the birth rate in 1947 being 26-61 per 1,000.

RELIGION

The population is principally Roman Catholic, but there is also a considerable Anglican congregation and a small Seventh Day Adventist Mission. Heads of Churches are the Bishop of Victoria (Roman Catholic) and the Archdeacon of Seychelles (Anglican).

HISTORY

The islands are believed to have been discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro Mascaregnas, in 1505, but the discovery was not apparently followed by any attempt at colonisation.

Previous to the French occupation they were the resort of pirates or corsairs who infested the Indian Ocean, some of whose names are borne by descendants in Mahé at the present time.

Under the government at Mauritius of Labourdonnais, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1743, and M. Picault, who took possession of the islands in the name of the King of France, called the principal island Mahe. In 1756 the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Moreau de Séchéles, who was Controller-General of Finance under Louis XV, from 1754 to 1756.

The natural resources of the islands and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and other inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and refitment, but on 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcome, of His Majesty's ship "Orpheus."

The last French Governor, M. De Quincy, who was born at Paris in November, 1748, became, after Lieutenant Sullivan, R.N., who had been placed in charge, had left, the first Agent Civil under the British Government. M. De Quincy's reign as French Governor lasted 20 years. He remained for 18 years in the service of the British Government, and died on 10th July, 1827.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Captain Ferrier of His Majesty's ship "Albion," but it was not until the capture of Mauritius in
1810, that Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that colony.

**CONSTITUTION**

From 1794 to 1810 Seychelles, though nominally a British colony, seems to have been administered as a French colony, and all Civil Status Acts ran in the name of the French Government. A Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed in 1872, when the finances of the Seychelles were separated from those of Mauritius. The title of the head of the Government was then changed from that of Civil Commissioner to that of Chief Civil Commissioner. The powers of the board were further enlarged in 1874 by another Order-in-Council.

The increasing importance of these islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in the constitution of the Government, and in December, 1888, an Order-in-Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council. In 1897, by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, the Administrator was given full powers as Governor, and Seychelles was practically separated from Mauritius. The separation was completely carried out by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, by which Seychelles was erected into a separate colony under its own Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

By the Legislative Council Order in Council of March, 1948, the elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time. The new Legislative Council, which held its first meeting in November, 1948, consists of the Governor as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. Any British subject of 21 years and upwards, who has been ordinarily resident in the Colony for 12 months, is entitled to be registered as a voter provided (a) he is literate, and (b) he pays either income or property tax.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The administrative functions of Government are carried out by the departments of Agriculture, Education, Health, Police, Port, Post, Public Works and Treasury, under the general direction of the Governor through the Secretary to Government who is the senior administrative officer.

The judiciary is composed of the Chief Justice, a Police Magistrate, and one part-time Justice of the Peace. The Attorney-General is also Crown Prosecutor and the Assistant Attorney-General also supervises the Registry of Deeds.

The Victoria Town Board manages the urban affairs of the capital and local boards have been appointed for North Mahé, South Mahé, Praslin and La Digue.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Education is under the control of a Director who is advised on education policy by an Advisory Council. As a result of a recent reorganisation of the education system all previous legislation has been repealed and replaced by Ordinance No. 15 of 1944. All schools are now inspected by officers of the Education Department, schools and teachers are registered and the salaries of teachers in aided schools are paid from public funds.

There is one Government Primary School, and six Church of England and twenty Roman Catholic aided primary schools, as well as a few small private schools. A Government modern school is being built at Grand’ Anse, Praslin. Secondary Education is provided at Seychelles College, a government school for boys, and for girls at St. Joseph’s Convent which receives a grant from public funds. The Cambridge School Certificate examination is taken in Form V in both schools. The enrolment in all schools in June, 1947, was 2,095 boys and 2,245 girls. Housecraft and technical centres have recently been opened. Bursaries are awarded at secondary schools for intending teachers and frequent refresher courses for teachers are held.

Government expenditure on education in 1947 was Rs. 121,118 from local funds and Rs. 113,927 from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund.

**Information Services**

The Secretary to Government is responsible for the “Government Bulletin”, which is issued daily and contains local announcements, Reuters News and the London Press Service. Broadcasting, visual information and the issue of printed information material are under the control of the Director of Education. Open air cinema shows to audiences averaging 2,000 persons are given on two or three nights a month, and much use is made of visual aids in training teachers and in schools. Programmes of talks, news and music are broadcast on Sundays and Wednesdays from ZCQ, on a frequency of 5,570 Kcs. and wavelength of 52 metres.

**Health**

Medical and health services are under the control of a Senior Medical Officer assisted by six Medical Officers, a Senior Health Inspector, and nursing and sanitary staff.

There are hospitals at Port Victoria, Baie Ste. Anne, Praslin and La Digue, a cottage hospital at Anse Royale, Mahé, and a health centre is in course of construction at Grand’ Anse, Praslin. The quarantine station is placed on Long Island opposite to Victoria.

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1947 was Rs. 335,704.

**Labour and Welfare**

During the year 1947 a sum of Rs. 32,637 was paid by the Poor Relief Department as outdoor relief to paupers. There were at the end of 1947, 1,063 persons receiving allotments from the Poor Relief Fund in the districts of Mahé, Praslin and La Digue.

In January, 1948, a Welfare and Labour Office was opened. There are at present 859 persons receiving allotments from the Poor Relief Fund and a general revision of individual cases is being carried out. The estimated cost for the year 1948 will amount to approximately Rs. 32,000.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Roads**

There are 120 miles of earth roads to a general minimum of 16 feet in width on the island, of which 84 miles are suitable for motor vehicles. The tar-macadamising of town roads is in hand.

**Railways**

There is no railway in the Colony.

**Shipping**

British India Steam Navigation Company passenger vessels on the Bombay-Mombasa service call at Port Victoria on the average once monthly in each direction.
Air

The Air Service provided by the Royal Air Force with flying boats between Seychelles and East Africa, Ceylon and Mauritius came to an end with the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force during 1946.

Posts and Telegraphs

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. Direct cables to Aden and Colombo were completed in 1922. Cable communication with every part of the world is now provided by Cable and Wireless, Ltd.

Cable and Wireless, Ltd., also maintains a coast station at Victoria for communication with ships at sea.

Shipping and air restrictions have adversely affected the postal services. Air mails come from abroad as far as Mombasa and Bombay and there have to await a ship.

The surplus of assets over liabilities on 31st December, 1947, was Rs. 2,901,237, including Rs. 400,000 interest-free loan to His Majesty's Government—and the market value of surplus funds invested was, on the same date, Rs. 1,986,324.

The Colony's Public Debt consists of a loan of Rs. 390,215 from the Imperial Government to finance the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. The loan is repayable in 30 years from 1938 by a sinking fund at Rs. 9,782 payable half yearly.

The main sources of revenue in the colony are taxation, including import and export duties, crown lands and investments. The import duties are specific and ad valorem, preferential rates being granted in respect of Empire imports. The duty on all primary foods is specific:—rice and flour 10 cents per kilo, barley and beans 1½ cents, maize and bran 1 cent, sugar 3 cents, coffee 9 cents and tea 6 cents per kilo. On other foodstuffs ad valorem duties are charged.

The ad valorem rates are 33⅓ per cent. and 17 per cent.—general and preferential. Free admissions are allowed in the case of condensed milk, cement, gunny bags, paints, enamels and tools of trade. There is an export duty on copra, essential oils and cinnamon bark at a flat rate of 10 per cent. and on vanilla at 17½ per cent. There is also a duty of R. 1 and 75 cents on guano depending on whether the total of phosphoric anhydride is more or less than 27-484.

Income tax on individuals is not chargeable on incomes of less than Rs. 500, and on chargeable incomes less than Rs. 1,000 the rate is 1 per cent. When the chargeable income amounts to Rs. 1,000 or more the rate is 2 per cent. on the first Rs. 1,000, increasing by 1 per cent. per 1,000 to Rs. 4,000. Over Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 17,000 the rate increases by 2½ per cent. per Rs. 1,000. On any excess over Rs. 17,000 the rate is 40 per cent.

Currency and Banking

A Government Savings Bank was established in March, 1897, and at the close of the year 1947, the amount standing to the credit of depositors was Rs. 3,320,532. Seventy-five per cent. of the Savings Bank funds are invested.

The legal tender currency is Seychelles notes and coins and Mauritius subsidiary coinage. Accounts are kept in rupees and cents.

Product and Trade

In 1947 the chief exports were copra, 4,862½ tons; guano, 14,287 tons; essential oils, 66,398 kilos; tortoise shell, 587 kilos; vanilla, 516½ kilos; and calipee, 4,287 kilos.

In Victoria there is a botanic garden containing many interesting tropical plants.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated coco-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelles administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are, however, to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands.

The percentage of trade in 1938, 1945, 1946 and 1947 was as follows:
