GIBRALTAR

SITUATION AND AREA

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long, high mountain called "The Rock," and a flat sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the "North Front." Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile. Its area is 1¾ square miles.

CLIMATE

The general climate of Gibraltar is mild and temperate, though somewhat hot and oppressive during the months of July and August. The rainy season lasts from September to May; the annual average rainfall is 35 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called "The Bay of Gibraltar," which is about 4 or 5 miles across and affords good anchorage for shipping. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock form an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea. At the northern end, between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea, lies the North Front, on which a landing ground was completed during the course of the war. From the northern end, the Rock runs southward to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the Fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lines lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only ¾ by ¼ mile. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden called "The Alameda." The civil population of the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south sides of the South mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being taken up with barracks, hospitals, etc., for the Military and the Navy. The Naval harbour is part of the west side of the Rock. It is formed by three separate moles known as the "North," "Detached," and "South" moles. The North Mole runs westward from Devil's Tongue for about 2,900 feet and then southwards, giving a total length of over a mile. The South Mole projects into the sea for a distance of 3,660 feet in a north-west direction. The Detached Mole, 2,717 feet long, is so situated between these two moles as to form a breakwater and leave two means of exit and entrance. The harbour contains a water area of 440 acres. There are three large graving docks for Naval purposes and a small dock which is available for merchant vessels of light draught.

POPULATION (CIVILIAN)

| Census, 1921 | 18,540 |
| Census, 1931 | 17,613 |
| Estimated, 1947 | 22,332 |

RELIGION

The large majority of the civilian population are Roman Catholics.
**History**

Gibraltar was known to the ancients as Mons Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules, the other being Mount Abyla, or Apes Hill, on the opposite coast of Africa. It was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain.

In 711 the Moorish Chief Tarik-Ibn-Zeyad landed on the Rock, and gave it the name of Gibel-Tarik, or Mountain of Tarik, of which the name of Gibraltar is a corruption. It remained in Moorish hands until 1309, when it was seized by the Spaniards. In 1333 it was again taken by the Moors, but was wrested from the Moslem dynasty in 1462 and reverted to the dominion of Spain.

In 1704, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 12th September, 1922, by a Governor aided by an Executive Council composed of four official and three unofficial members. The power of legislation is vested in the Governor who is also the General Officer Commanding the Garrison. It was announced on 24th November, 1948, that a Legislative Council would be established, as soon as the necessary instruments could be prepared, to consist of the Governor and three ex-officio members, two nominated members, and five elected members.

**Administration**

The revenue of the colony is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, licence duties and fees and import duties.

The present Customs Tariff includes import duties on wines, liquors, spirits, including perfumed spirits, and tobacco with Empire preferential rates, and on motor spirit.

The management of the drainage, water supply, etc., is in the hands of the City Council, a body which, by legislation enacted in 1945, now contains for the first time in its history a popularly elected majority. The Council's receipts for 1947 were £294,501, its expenditure £285,829 and its debt on 31st December, 1947, £141,794.

**Social Services**

**Education**

Education has been compulsory since 1917. Government assumed full responsibility for education in the Colony in 1944 on the repatriation of the civil population. A Director of Education has been appointed and fully qualified teachers, both religious and lay, have been recruited from the United Kingdom on Government contracts. There are at present four secondary and ten primary and infants schools in operation with a total number of pupils at 31st December, 1947, of 2,504. Government expenditure on education in 1947 amounted to £43,778 whilst estimated expenditure in 1948 is £50,510.

**Information and Public Relations**

The duties of Public Relations Officer are discharged by the Chief Assistant Secretary.

**Health**

The medical and health services of the Colony include:

(a) The Colonial Hospital, containing 153 beds, for the reception of British and other residents, merchant seamen and all civil emergencies.

(b) The King George V Hospital for diseases of the chest, containing 50 beds.

(c) The Infectious Diseases Hospital for the treatment of small-pox, cholera, plague, and yellow fever, with accommodation for 40 beds.

(d) The Mental Hospital. This hospital is only partially renovated and has accommodation for only 12 patients.

Other services provided by the Colonial Government are:

- Child welfare service.
- Port health service.
- School medical service.
- School dental service.
- Medical service to the Police and Prison Department.

A General out-patients department at the Colonial Hospital.

Free domiciliary treatment of the poor, by two part-time district medical officers.

Domiciliary treatment of Government servants.

Public vaccination.

Physiotherapy and radiography.

The following special clinics are held at the Colonial Hospital:

- Antenatal clinic.
- Clinic for diseases of the eye.
- Clinic for diseases of the ear, nose and throat.
- Orthopaedic and fractures clinic.
- Dental clinic.
- Gynaecological and post natal clinic.
- Diabetic clinic.

**Labour and Welfare**

The staffs dealing with the repatriation and resettlement of Gibraltarians evacuated to the United Kingdom during the War and of the Social Welfare Office have been amalgamated with the Labour Department under a Director of Labour and Welfare.

Following enactment of the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance in July, 1947, eleven trades unions have been registered with an approximate aggregate membership of 4,500.

A Shop Hours Amendment Ordinance, enacted in October, 1947, reduced the maximum permissible weekly hours of employment of shop assistants from 66 to 48.

An Ordinance to amend the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Ordinance was enacted in March, 1948, to give the force of law to the following conventions of the International Labour Organisation: Minimum Age (Trimmers and Stokers) Convention, 1921; Medical Examination of Young Persons (Sea) Convention, 1921; Underground Work (Women) Convention, 1935.

A draft Workmen’s Compensation Ordinance, based substantially on the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1946, has been prepared, but completion depends upon the acquisition of statistics.
Conditions of employment of workers employed by the three Service Departments, the Colonial Government and the City Council are co-ordinated by the Standing Wages Committee presided over by the Head of the Labour and Welfare Department. Consultations are proceeding with a view to the establishment of a Labour Advisory Board consisting of representatives of official and commercial employers and trade unions.

The policy of full employment for British subjects initiated in 1946 has been maintained and developed by giving preference in the filling of notified vacancies to British subjects. By this means the percentage of unemployment amongst male British subjects has been maintained at a level of less than \( \frac{1}{2} \) per cent.

During 1947, the continued increase in demand for labour and shortage of skilled labour in building trades made it necessary to import carpenters and masons from Tangier and Italy. The total registered labour force rose to 18,700 in December, 1947—an increase of 7 per cent. during the year.

Trade unions were active but there were no strikes during 1947 and industrial relations were generally good.

Several collective agreements covering dock labour were made during the year between trade unions and private employers. The determination of fair wages, where this has been the matter under dispute, has been facilitated by the adoption by Government of model rules relating to Fair Wages Clauses.

A 44-hour, five-day week is in force in the Service Departments, Colonial Government and City Council, and there has been little systematic working of overtime recorded.

Monthly computations of the cost of living index are made, and the average working class index for 1947 was 177 compared with 100 in July, 1939. During the latter half of 1947 the index rose due to increases in the controlled price of imported food stuffs, but during the first half of 1948 remained stable at approximately 187.

The Public Assistance Scheme introduced in 1946 providing for the grant of financial aid to indigent persons has been expanded to provide assistance to unemployed persons; and the scales of payment have been increased. The maximum assistance payable to any one family is now equal to six-sevenths of the minimum industrial worker's wage.

Unemployment and Old Age Pensions legislation is contemplated.

**Communications**

**Roads**

The Colony's roads are vested by law in the City Council, which is responsible for their upkeep. There are no railways or tramways in Gibraltar.

**Shipping**

Owing to its geographical position, Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and a coaling station by vessels of every nationality. The voyage between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom takes about four and a half days.

There is a daily steamer service between Gibraltar and the town of Algeciras on the opposite side of the Bay as well as a weekly service with Tangier.

**Air**

British European Airways operate a twice-weekly service between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom via Madrid and Bordeaux.

**Postal**

Air mail correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom twice a week. Transmission time is two days.

Ordinary correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom by sea. Time in transit averages 14 days.

Air mail services exist to most countries and facilities are being extended as world conditions improve.

A daily service is maintained with the continent of Europe and North Africa.

**Telegraphs**

The Government land lines connecting Gibraltar with Spain are worked by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., who have a station at Gibraltar. Telegrams are accepted for all parts of the world.

**Telephones**

The telephone system is under the control of the City Council. Telephone communication is at present restricted to the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Spanish Morocco and Tangier.

The local Naval and Military departments have their own lines which are connected with the City Council scheme.
