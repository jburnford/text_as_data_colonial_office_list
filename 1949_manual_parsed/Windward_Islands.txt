THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

SITUATION AND AREA

The Windward Islands consist of the four islands of Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically—Tobago from 1764 to 1784, and all three in 1838. The three last named islands and, as from 1st January, 1940, Dominica, which on that date was separated from the Leeward Islands, are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the four colonies is 829 square miles, and their estimated population at the census of 1946, 250,418.

HISTORY

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here.

As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white, and there are some Indian coolies. A few Caribs still
remain in St. Vincent and Dominica. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia and Dominica the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois.

**CONSTITUTION**

Each island retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary for the Windward Islands. The colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica are presided over by resident administrators. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. A Windward Islands Court of Appeal was set up in 1850 (13 & 14 Vict. c. 15) and abolished in 1920 by an Act (9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 47) which set up a Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 16 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line. The passenger and cargo steamers of the Canadian National Line call at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. Government-owned telephone systems exist throughout the islands. All four islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with the West Indies and Canada through the system of Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Ltd., and thence with Great Britain and all parts of the world through the system of Cable & Wireless, Ltd. A coast station is also maintained at St. Lucia for communication with ships at sea.

Airfields have been constructed at Grenada and St. Lucia, and it is proposed that an airfield should be constructed at Dominica and St. Vincent. Grenada and St. Lucia are at present served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule.

A wireless installation has been erected at Carricou by the local Government. It communicates with Grenada and through that island to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, etc., the ordinary tariff being 2d. per word more than from Grenada.

**DOMINICA**

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 158° 40' N. latitude, and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. longitude; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about 30 miles and has an area of 304½ square miles.

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Imray’s View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet.

Dominica was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to
the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £312,092 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and Tobago.

In 1771 the island was constituted a separate government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On 21st June, 1775, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on 7th September after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchil-leau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading general), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000 to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts, near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a governor-in-chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and bluejackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H.L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of £15,000 by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the island. Owing to the economic depression of the island, which started from about 1928, and the reduction of the imports and exports, it has been necessary to appeal to the Imperial Government for several grants and loans-in-aid. These have assisted conditions greatly and as a result there are already signs that the productivity of the island is on the increase.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was separated from the colony of the Leeward Islands and grouped with the Windward Islands.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but blight and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is good and the climate healthy. Limes and cocoa flourish throughout the coastal zone. The former were almost wiped out by root disease a few years ago, but trees, budded on resistant stocks, have since been extensively planted, and exports of lime products are now increasing. The higher slopes in the centre of the island are well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, oranges, nutmegs, spices and such tropical fruits as require humid conditions.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Lime juice, cocoa, coconuts, copra, rum, tobacco, vanilla and fruit (including green limes, grape fruit, oranges, mangoes, bananas and avocado pears), are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, has now ceased to be made. Trade is carried on also in spices, oils and timber.

The chief town, Roseau, is a port of registry. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1915.

There is a Government telephone system with five exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The local government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an act abrogating itself and substituting the crown colony system. A Legislative Council was created, consisting of 12 members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. Ordinance
No. 21 of 1924 provided for the election of four of the unofficial members of the Council with the Administrator presiding in the absence of the Governor from the presidency. As a result of the report of the Closer Union Commission which visited Dominica among other West Indian islands in 1932, the Secretary of State approved of a further change in the constitution of the island to provide for the creation of a new Legislative Council with an unofficial majority, subject to certain safeguards, being left in the hands of the Governor. This change was effected under Ordinance No. 8 of 1936, which was brought into force by proclamation on 15th December, 1936, and provides for a Legislative Council consisting of the Administrator as president, with a casting vote only, two official members, three nominated members and five elected members. The first meeting of the Council under the new constitution was held on 10th May, 1937.

A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1298, 1902 and Cd. 3990, 1932).

**Population**

1946 (estimated) ... 47,700

**Customs Tariff**

The rates of duty under the customs tariff are mainly specific. A preferential reduction varying in amount, but in most cases amounting to one-third of the general rate, is accorded to Empire products.

The ad valorem duty on most articles is 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. That on perfumery, jewellery and plate and plated ware is 20 per cent. and 30 per cent.

**Grenada**

**Situation and Area**

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. latitude, and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. longitude; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 24th April, 1921) of 7,104.

**Climate**

The climate is good and during the months from December to the end of April, when the trade winds prevail, it is delightful. From July to October there is greater humidity and higher temperature with little variation between night and day. The climate may be regarded as hot during this period but it is not unhealthy at any time during the year. There is an appreciable variation of rainfall.

**General Description**

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and seven miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former there is a Government rest house. The island is well equipped with roads. All the first-class roads and practically all the second and third-class roads are suitable for motor traffic. Bitumen-surfaced first-class roads run completely round the island and across it in two directions. A large proportion of the second-class roads are also surface treated and all roads leading to places of interest are all-weather roads. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark and St. John—while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a Commissioner. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping. Its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call for steamers.

The other towns in the colony are Gouyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Pauve), Sauteurs, Grenville (or La Baye), and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken. French patois used to be spoken by the peasantry but the practice is declining rapidly. About 2 per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race.

**Population**

1946 (estimated) . . . . 72,650

**History**

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims. In 1762 it was surrendered to the British under Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on 10th February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1795–6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated by the French Republic. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred by
the rebels and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established in regard to the African slaves, and this was followed in 1838 by their unconditional emancipation.

CONSTITUTION

There was from 1766 a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 21 elected members.

Under an Act of 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of 7th October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 members, eight elected by the people, and nine nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of five members, three being nominated and the other two elected Members of Assembly. These members received each a salary of £100 a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on 9th February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and crown colony government was established in December, 1877.

On 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

Until 1st December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

By an Order-in-Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, seven ex officio members, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members. The island was divided into five electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

By an Order-in-Council dated 27th October 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted; and now consists of the Governor, three ex officio members (the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Treasurer), four nominated members and seven elected members (one for each of seven electoral districts). At the same time, the Governor is given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government. By an Order-in-Council dated 11th May, 1945, the title of Colonial Secretary was altered to that of Administrator.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards.

EDUCATION

There are 52 elementary schools, 10 Government and 42 aided. These schools are Senior, Combined and Junior. Head teachers are paid from £90 to £268 per annum, according to their certificates of proficiency and to the class of school. Bonuses are given them for extra duties. Grants are also given by Government in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. There are in addition a handicraft centre for boys and a housecraft centre for girls, both of which are situated in St. George's. A Board of Education nominated by the Governor gives advice to Government in educational matters. There is a Government secondary school for boys. There are three private secondary schools for girls, which receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue.

INDUSTRY, TRADE AND CUSTOMS

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. The chief produce of Grenada is cocoa. The modern sugar factory which was erected in 1936 in the southern part of the island manufactures sufficient sugar to meet local demands. No sugar is exported as yet. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such, for instance, as limes, coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, etc. Nutmeg cultivation occupies a prominent position. The export of bananas to Canada has been discontinued owing to shipping difficulties during the war, and shipments are now confined to relatively small consignments to Trinidad. In Carriacou cotton is the staple product. The cultivation of limes has now been successfully established in Carriacou. Tropical fruits of almost every description and of the finest quality are fairly plentiful and are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, tanias, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, bananas, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, etc. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The commercial value of the forests is now being explored. Rum is manufactured for local consumption.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware. The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit and poultry.
The tariff of import duties is partly on an ad valorem and partly on a specific basis. The rates in the case of the former are mainly 15 per cent. on Empire goods and 22½ per cent. on foreign goods. The preference on Empire goods is generally 33½ per cent.

The total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, was 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,467.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889.

A co-operative bank was established in 1932, but there is no agricultural bank in the colony.

ST. LUCIA
Situation and Area
The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus during his fourth voyage, on 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 54' N. latitude and 60° 59' W. longitude, at a distance of 24 miles to the south of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 27 miles in length, and 14 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is 150 miles, and its area 233 square miles—about the size of Middlesex. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

General Description
On its final acquisition by the English, the island of St. Lucia had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by internecine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things was slow, being retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect. Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is gradually becoming more general. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, or of East Indian origin.

The danger from venomous reptiles is much exaggerated. Owing to the introduction and spread of the mongoose, snakes are now but rarely met with. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are almost unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° F., even at midday, in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera.

Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour. Dredging operations are carried out annually. There is a substantial concrete wharf, 650 feet in length, with a depth alongside of 27 feet at low water. There is another wharf, 540 feet in length, originally constructed in wood, which is gradually being reconstructed in concrete, and is kept dredged to a depth of 14 feet at low water. The facilities offered by the port as a port of call and coaling station are widely recognised. It is a port of registry.

POPULATION
1946 (estimated) ... 70,000

HISTORY
At the period of its discovery St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for £1,600 to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.
In 1744 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Islet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of 12th April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June, 1803, and has since continued under British rule.

SAVINGS BANKS

A Government Savings Bank was established in 1871.

Branch savings banks exist at Soufrière, Vieux-Fort, Denney, Gros Islet and Anse-la-Raye.

CONSTITUTION AND LAW

Up to the period of the French Revolution and after the restoration of order in 1800 the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy.

The government is conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council.

By an Order-in-Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted, and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Administrator, Crown Attorney and Treasurer), three nominated members and five elected members (one for each of three electoral districts and two members for a fourth district).

At the same time the Governor was given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government. Other changes made were the fixing of a common age qualification, 21 years, for male and female voters, and a widening of the qualifications of electors.

Under the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands (Courts) Order-in-Council, 1939, were established one Supreme Court of Judicature for the colonies of Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Dominica and the Leeward Islands in place of the superior courts then existing, and also a court for the hearing and determination of appeals in criminal cases and in such other matters as may be prescribed by law. The judges of this Supreme Court are (1) the Chief Justice who resides in Grenada and performs work in Grenada and St. Vincent; and (2) two puisne judges, one of whom residing in St. Lucia performs work in St. Lucia and Dominica, whereas the other residing in St. Kitts performs work in St. Kitts-Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat and Virgin Islands.

A code of civil law, the authors of which were Sir G. W. Des Voeux, G.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code was framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances. The statute law of the colony was consolidated to 1916 by Mr. F. H. Coller, Chief Justice, who also edited the Commercial Code, 1916.

The revising and editing of the criminal law and procedure of the colony by Mr. J. E. M. Salmon was completed during 1920 and proclaimed as the Criminal Code, 1920. It came into force on 1st January, 1921.

EDUCATION

In 1828 the first public school in St. Lucia was established by the Anglican body but lasted only two years. In 1836 there were four schools in existence with an enrolment of less than 100. The first serious attempt to establish schools on a proper footing was made in 1838, the prime mover being Bishop Smith (Vicar Apostolic of the West Indies). During the same year the Lady Mico Charity accepted educational responsibilities in the colony.

The first Government grant towards education, a sum of £450, was paid to the Mico Charity in 1845, and in 1852 the first Government schools were opened. The charity discontinued its work during 1891 and its seven schools were distributed between Government and the religious denominations; at the end of that year there were four Government schools and 22 denominational assisted schools, of which the Roman Catholic body conducted 16.

In 1898 Government handed over its three remaining schools to the Roman Catholic body and thus all schools became denominational assisted schools, and have remained so up to the present. A Board of Education, an advisory body, was constituted in 1936.

From October, 1943, an Education Officer paid from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, became head of the Education Department.

Government grants £450 per annum to St. Mary's College, a Roman Catholic Secondary School for boys, and £175 per annum to St. Joseph's Convent, a similar school for girls conducted by the Sisters of St. Joseph.

INDUSTRY, TRADE AND CUSTOMS

Limes and lime products, sugar, rum, cocoa, coconuts, bananas, bay oil, bay rum, spices and sea island cotton are produced. There are three sugar factories, 16 lime factories (for the production of lime oils and juices), three rum distilleries, and one bay oil distillery.
A fair amount of land in certain districts is in the possession of the Crown, and, under certain conditions, is available for sale for development purposes; the soil will grow any kind of tropical fruit trees or economic plants. Attention is now being paid to the establishment of land settlement schemes with a view to utilising the latent resources of the colony.

The customs import tariff is mainly on a specific duty basis, with a preference in favour of Empire products which in most cases amounts to one-third of the general tariff rate.

ST. VINCENT

Situation and Area

The island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on 22nd January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 96,000 acres of land—about two-thirds the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of nine miles from Kingstown.

General Description

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the southwestern extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach. It is a port of registry.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Barrouallie on the west.

The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufrière," or volcano, situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rising to about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea. After a violent eruption in 1812 it remained dormant for a period of ninety years, and then broke into violent eruption again on 7th May, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont Pelée in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 feet), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates. The next highest point after the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. In September, 1921, the island was again struck by a hurricane which although not as violent as its predecessor, did considerable damage to property and crops, entailing considerable hardship on the populace and necessitating the expenditure by Government of £3,288 on relief measures.

The prevailing wind is south-east.

History

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George I made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £63,625.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1795 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly on 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports...
having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first East Indian coolie labourers in 1861. Most of them returned to India, but some made their home in the colony.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council and Assembly.

The Council consisted of 12 members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of 19 members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of 10 members, five from the Legislative Council and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the colony, and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated and, instead, a single Legislative Assembly was created. This assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex-officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an act of the local legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. Until 1st December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

By an Order-in-Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, four ex-officio members, one nominated unofficial member and three elected members. By the St. Vincent (Legislative Council) Amendment Order-in-Council, 1931, the Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, three ex-officio members, one nominated official member, one nominated unofficial member, and three elected members. The island was divided into three electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

By an Order-in-Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted, and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Administrator, Crown Attorney and Treasurer), three nominated members and five elected members (one for each of five electoral districts).

At the same time, the Governor was given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation, which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government.

By the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands (Courts) Order-in-Council, 1939, which came into operation on 1st January, 1940, the Supreme Court of Judicature ceased to exist; and in its place was established the Supreme Court of the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands, which is divided into circuits. There is a Chief Justice of the said court, together with two puisne judges.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

There are 38 primary schools, and two Government secondary schools, one for boys and the other for girls.

An Island Scholarship is awarded triennially, tenable for periods from three to five years at an approved university: annual value £250, and cost of passage. An agricultural scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture is awarded triennially: annual value £200.

**Information Services**

The post of Information Officer was abolished at the end of the war, and such duties of the office which still remained were taken over by the Social Welfare Department. These duties consist of the distribution of literature, posters and films which are received from the Colonial Office.

**Health**

St. Vincent is a very healthy island, particularly because malaria is almost unknown. In fact, no tropical diseases are common in this island with the exception of yaws, which flourishes in the more remote parts of the territory.

**Labour**

A separate Department of Labour was established in this colony on 20th September, 1937, and a Labour Commissioner was appointed to be responsible for the administration of the Department, whose chief functions are to supervise and review the conditions of the various forms of employment of workers which exist in the colony, to ensure the due enforcement of all labour legislation and to use his utmost efforts to promote harmonious relations between employees and their employers.

**Welfare**

Government Welfare Activities are directed by a Social Welfare Department consisting of a Social Welfare Officer and three Senior Assistants. The main activities dealt with by this Department are the administration of Poor Relief, Club Work, Handicrafts, Probation, Physical Recreation and the publication of the Social Welfare News. The formation and supervision of Village Councils will shortly be added to the duties of the Department.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Roads**

The Colony of St. Vincent possesses about 400 miles of roads of which about 100 miles are motorable all the year through. A well-defined highway runs close to the coast from the town of Georgetown on the eastern coast, through the capital—Kingstown—in the south to the town of Chateaubelair on the western coast. The total length of this highway is about 50 miles, of which about 30 miles are oiled. Here and there along its route the highway is joined by lateral roads debouching from the valleys, or running along the slopes of spurs or on the crests of ridges out of the hinterland. There is no cross-country road.
Shipping

A limited service is maintained with Europe, Canada, the United States of America and certain West Indian Islands by the Harrison Line of Steamers, the Canadian National Steamship Company and the Alcoa Steamship Company, Inc.

A number of sailing vessels assist with the communication with the other West Indian Islands.

Airfields

There is one small airfield in the Colony of St. Vincent situate at Diamond, 7 miles north-east of the capital, Kingstown. It is S. 61° 42' E. along its length and S. 28° 18'E. along its width. Its position is Longitude 61° 09' 20" W., Latitude 13° 08' 20" N. The runway is turfed with longitudinal slopes in excess of 1 per cent. and is 3,000 feet long and 200 feet wide. The approach is difficult, over and between hills. There are no night-landing facilities.

Posts and Telegraphs

In addition to the General Post Office, Kingstown, there are 21 district Post Offices in St. Vincent, four of which are situated in the Islands of the St. Vincent Grenadines. A daily mail service is operated by omnibus, motor launch or vessel to 17 district Post Offices on the mainland, and to one district Post Office in the Grenadines. A weekly service by auxiliary vessel is operated to the remaining three district Post Offices in the Grenadines.

St. Vincent is a member of the Universal Postal Union. Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Ltd. own and operate the only telegraph station, St. Vincent, which maintains communications from Kingstown with all parts of the world.
