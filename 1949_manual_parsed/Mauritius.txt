MAURITIUS

Situation and Area

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 48' E. longitude and 19° 50' and 20° 31' S. latitude, distant 115 miles from Reunion, 934 from Seychelles, 1,300 from Natal, 2,000 from Cape Comorin, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 550 from Madagascar. By the Cape route the island is approximately 10,000 miles from the United Kingdom. It comprises an area of about 720 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), with an extreme length of 39 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 29 miles from east to west.

The island is chiefly of volcanic formation but is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains but none of great height. The principal peaks are the Piton de la Riviere Noire (2,711 feet), Pieter Both (2,690 feet), and the Pouce (2,661 feet). There are numerous rivers and streams; they flow generally through deep ravines and their course is broken by many small waterfalls and rapids. None of them is navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. The land rises gradually from the coasts, and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile and picturesque plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 to 1,800 feet. On this high and healthy tableland the temperature and climate are excellent.

Climate and Rainfall

Mauritius, lying in the tropics, but situated as it is in the midst of the extensive belt of south-east trade current of the Indian Ocean, has a climate which is subject to tropical and sub-tropical maritime influences and to which its natural topography adds a great diversity of features. Intense tropical conditions exist in the lowlands, especially in the north, north-west and western parts; while on the central high tableland and in the elevated east and south-eastern districts, which are almost constantly swept by the normal trade wind, a milder and more equable climate prevails.

Two quite marked seasons are experienced during the year: a hot season which occurs from December to April, and a cool or mild season from June to September. The hottest time of the year is usually the second half of January, and the coldest the second half of July or first days of August. In the lowlands, at the height of summer, shade temperatures have been known occasionally to attain 35° C. (95° F.) while an average daily maximum temperature of 30° C. (86° F.) is observed from December to March inclusive. In the milder parts of the island, over the central tableland, at an altitude of 1,800 feet above sea level, the corresponding extremes of shade temperature are about 5° to 7° C. (11° F.) lower. The lowest temperature experienced in the highlands of Mauritius is probably near 7° C. (45° F.) whilst in the lowlands it has been only very rarely known to fall to 10° C. (50° F.). The average variation of temperature in a day is between 6° C. and 8° C. (12° F.), and this range is nearly the same in summer and in winter. The mean day and mean night temperatures differ by about 3° C. (6° F.) in summer and in winter, but during the exceptionally dry weather and clear sky of September and October, this difference attains nearly 5° C. (9° F.).

Probably the most unhealthy feature of the climate is the high humidity which exists by reason of the maritime conditions prevailing. In the lowlands of the north-west, humidity averages between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent., according to the time of year. On the central plateau this value is still greater by 10 per cent. in summer and 13 per cent. in winter. Humidity, in general, increases at night time by about 20 per cent. of the saturation as compared with its daytime value.

The island has an abundant rainfall which is by reason of the natural contour very unevenly distributed. The east and south-east districts, which are swept by the south-east trade wind during the greater part of the year, are very well watered, receiving from 75 to 100 inches of rainfall annually; on the eastern slope of the central tableland the annual rainfall increases from 125 to 175 inches. The west and north-west coastal regions are the driest of the island; less than 40 inches of rainfall are normally recorded in these parts annually.

Mauritius is situated in the most disturbed region of the south Indian Ocean as regards the hurricanes which occur in this part of the world. These cyclones, numbering about eight annually, are more frequently encountered during the period from December to April. Such disturbances as a rule supply the best part of the summer rainfall, which is so important for the agricultural pursuits of the island; the absence of cyclones has, only too often for its counterpart, prolonged droughts, which are disastrous economically. Droughts in Mauritius seem to occur almost periodically, and have been known to last from 6 months to 14 months on occasions.

General Description

The permanent settled population of the European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony of its size. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French noblesse. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture.

Nine daily newspapers (of which three combined during the war) and 20 other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language and a creole patois are spoken all over the island. English is used in the Supreme Court of Justice and by the administration. Debates in the Council of Government may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Riviere du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems and Black River.

The city of Port Louis is the capital and seat of government, and contained, with its suburbs, an estimated population of 65,962 at the census enumeration of 11th June, 1944. The harbour is a good one and able to receive a number of vessels. A scheme for widening to 800 feet the channel along both sides of which vessels are made fast to buoys, is under consideration. Fort George to the north defends the port.

There are large police barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal corporation, and raised in 1947 a revenue of Rs. 1,224,042-63 against an expenditure of Rs. 1,239,277-58. Its net debt amounted to Rs. 49,857-50 at 31st December, 1947.
The principal public edifices of Port Louis are Government House, the Mauritius Institute, the Roman Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, the civil hospital, town hall, municipal theatre and the public offices. There is a racecourse most beautifully situated in the Champ de Mars.

A sewage scheme provides for the disposal of the sewage of the central part of the town.

After Port Louis the largest town is Curepipe, incorporated in 1890 (population 27,468, census of 1944), situated on the uplands in the Plaines Wilhems district. The combined township of Rose Hill-Beau Bassin has a population of 26,612.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg (population 9,919, census of 1944), so called in honour of Mahe de Labourdonnais.

With the exception of a few villages which still derive their supplies from private wells or from open streams, the rest of the island obtains its water supply from pipe-borne supplies which are derived from various sources under the control of the Public Works Department with the exception of the Port Louis supply from Grand River North West which is under the control of the municipality.

The two main supplies are those of the town of Port Louis and of the district of Plaines Wilhems.

The Port Louis supply is derived from Grand River North West at a distance of about 4 miles from the town and at an elevation of 250 feet. The quantity delivered is about 5 million gallons per day.

The Plaines Wilhems supply is derived from Mare-aux Vacoas, a storage reservoir of 3,750 million gallons at an altitude of 1,825 feet. The principal towns dependent on the latter source of supply are Curepipe (to which the water is pumped), Vacoas, Phoenix, Quatre Bornes, Rose Hill and Beau Bassin in the district of Plaines Wilhems, and Reduit, Moka and Saint Pierre in the district of Moka.

The supply has been extended to Port Louis, where the quantity available for supply is 500,000 gallons per day, and also to part of Black River district.

The total quantity delivered is about 5 million gallons per day.

Both the Grand River North West water and the Mare-aux-Vacoas water are filtered and chlorinated before distribution. Frequent analyses are made by the Medical and Health Department. Both these waters are of a high standard of purity after filtration and chlorination.

Of the two schemes undertaken by Government for the irrigation of the coastal regions below the 60-inch rainfall line in the north and northwest of the island, only one has been completed, viz., that of "La Ferme," which irrigates 3,000 acres from a storage reservoir situated at an elevation of 450 feet above sea level and with a capacity of 2,500 million gallons.

The other scheme which was originally intended to irrigate 15,000 acres has been completed only in respect of the construction of a low level reservoir at La Nicoliere of a capacity of 1,270 million gallons and of the connection thereof to the high rainfall region of Midlands by a canal 17 miles long. The uncompleted scheme as it now stands irrigates 300 acres.

A new reservoir for domestic supply is under construction at Mare Longue in the central plateau. The work is being financed from Mauritius development and welfare funds.

* Including Chinese.

At the census of 11th June, 1944, the population of Mauritius (exclusive of the dependencies and military) totalled 419,185. The Indo-Mauritians were 63·3 per cent. of the total population. These descendants of the immigrants from India now form the largest section of the population. They are predominant in domestic, commercial, and still more in agricultural callings, where they are to be found as market gardeners, estate labourers and small planters.

### RELIGION

The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the census of 1944, the Roman Catholics numbered 141,941, and the Protestants about 4,165, including dependencies and military. The Roman Catholics receive an annual grant from Government amounting to Rs. 149,816, the Church of England Rs. 45,533, and the Church of Scotland Rs. 8,558.

The majority of the Indo-Mauritians are Hindus, the remainder, numbering about 60,000, being Muslims. Of the 12,380 Chinese resident in Mauritius, approximately 7,000 are Buddhists.

### HISTORY

The Mascarene Archipelago was probably known to Arab navigators at an early date. A Dutch map copied from Arab sources shows the
islands now known as Mauritius, Rodrigues and Réunion under the names of Dinarobin, Dinanora and Margabin, and it is possible that certain islands marked on Idrisi's map (1153) are intended to indicate them also.

There can be little doubt too that the island was visited by the Malays who colonised Madagascar in the 15th-16th century.

The history of Mauritius really begins with its discovery by the Portuguese in the beginning of the sixteenth century—probably between 1507 and 1512, but not later than 1527, when the island is shown on an official map under the name of Santa Appollonia, borne in common with the other islands known later as the Mascarenes (Reunion and Rodrigues) after the great navigator Dom Pedro Mascarenhas.

The Portuguese named the island Ilha da Cirnos, or Swan Island, from the big birds resembling swans found on shore. They merely used the island as a port of call, without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch. In 1598 a Dutch fleet landed in the south-eastern harbour of the island, to which its commander, Admiral Wybrandt Van Warwyk, gave the name of Mauritius, in honour of the Stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. For many years no attempt was made at colonisation, but from 1638 onwards petty settlements were established at various points, the seat of government being at the place known as Old Grand Port. The colony did not prosper, and was finally abandoned by the Dutch in 1710.

In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French, but was not actually occupied till 1721, when a small party of colonists were sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The island was then named Isle de France. This name was retained until the landing of the English in 1810, when the former name of Mauritius was restored. Of all the governors of the island, the most celebrated was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735-1746), "a man of eminent talents" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who encouraged the cultivation of sugar-cane and introduced many other valuable plants. He was the real founder of the prosperity of the Isle de France.

In 1767, the French East India Company, having gone into liquidation, handed over the island to the Crown, Jean Daniel Dumas being appointed Governor General for the King, and Pierre Poivre, Intendant. Poivre was a man of great ability; he introduced into the colony cloves and nutmegs secretly obtained from the Dutch Sunda Archipelago. Having purchased the ancient residence of the Company's governors, at Monplaisir, he converted the grounds into a nursery where many useful plants introduced by him were cultivated. On his departure this property was sold to Government, the garden being entrusted to Poivre's friend, Nicolas Céré, under whose able management it became famous under the name of King's Gardens. It is now the Royal Botanical Gardens, Pamplemousses.

In 1790, at the outbreak of the French Revolution, a Colonial Assembly was elected, which for 13 years governed the island de facto.

In 1792 another very able Governor was sent out from France, Comte de Malartic, who during this troubled period managed to gain the affection of the whole community. In 1803, the Isle de France was taken charge of by General Decaen, appointed Captain General by Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul, with instructions to suspend the Colonial Assembly and the Isle de France's constitution for a period of 10 years.

During the long war between England and France, the Isle de France was a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, owing to the facility with which sorties were made from its harbour by French men-of-war and privateers; and in 1809 the British Government determined on its capture. The neighbouring islands of Rodrigues and Réunion were taken possession of and several naval engagements were fought to the credit of both navies. The most famous of these was the battle of the Isle de la Passe, fought in the bay of Grand Port on 23rd and 24th August, 1810, between four English frigates and two French frigates, a corvette and a captured East Indiaman. The English lost the day, two of their ships having gone on shoals early in the engagement, but the great gallantry shown by both sides has rendered the fight memorable in the annals of the two navies.

A strong expeditionary force was then sent out from the three presidencies of India and the Cape. Twelve thousand troops under General Abercromby were landed, and the island finally surrendered to Great Britain on 3rd December, 1810, the laws, religion and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation.

The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The first English Governor, Mr. (later Sir) R. T. Farquhar (1810-1823) gained a well-deserved popularity. During his tenure of office, on 25th September, 1816, a quarter of Port Louis was destroyed by a conflagration. On 28th February, 1818, the island was laid waste by a terrific cyclone which caused immense destruction to property.

In the year 1832 the Council of Government, which was established on 19th August, 1825, was abolished, and a Legislative Council, with half the members official, created. The oaths of office were taken by the new members on 23rd January, 1832.

On 1st April, 1835, the emancipation of slaves took place without disorder; but, as this new class of free men refused employment as labourers, the planters were obliged to resort to the introduction of labour from India. This was finally authorised in 1842, under the supervision of an agent residing in India, and it continued with temporary interruptions until 1910.

In 1849 the Legislative Council voted the law constituting a municipal corporation for the town of Port Louis.

The year 1864 saw the opening of the North railway line from Port Louis to Pamplemousses, and the Midland line was inaugurated two years later.

In December, 1866, malaria was introduced into the island. During the next 12 months 31,758 persons died from fever, including 18,308 in Port Louis alone.

In 1868 and 1874 Mauritius was visited by severe cyclones. During the former two spans of the Grand River railway viaduct were brought down by the force of the wind. On 20th April, 1892, one of the most violent cyclones ever recorded ruined a considerable portion of Port Louis, besides causing infinite havoc to buildings and crops. The death roll amounted to 1,232.
In order to assist the planters and other owners of immovable property affected by the calamity, a loan of £600,000 was guaranteed by the Imperial Government.

On 23rd July, 1893, part of Port Louis was again destroyed by fire. At the end of the same year ocean telegraphic communication was opened.

In 1902 an outbreak of surra caused the almost total loss of draught animals, and mechanical means of transport had to be resorted to for the sugar plantations. Since then the industry has become increasingly mechanised.

In 1909 a Royal Commission visited the island to enquire into the administration and finance of the colony.

During the Great War of 1914–1918 Mauritius suffered in no way by direct action on the part of the enemy. A number of volunteers proceeded to Europe for military service and a "labour battalion" was supplied for Mesopotamia.

The enormous post-war rise in the price of sugar brought great prosperity to the colony, and the gross value of the crop of 1920-1921 is estimated to have been approximately Rs. 250,000,000.

In 1921 investigations of the sanitary and health conditions were made by Dr. Andrew Balfour, C.B., C.M.G. Many of the works recommended have been carried out.

In 1923 the Indian Government consented to the resumption of immigration of labourers from India consequent on the repeal of the penal clauses of the Labour Law of 1878 affecting labour.

Immigration was accordingly resumed for a period of 12 months ending on 31st May, 1924, but with disappointing results, most of the immigrants having returned to India by the end of the same year.

In March, 1931, a cyclone lasted three days and caused considerable damage to property. A loan of £600,000 was guaranteed by the Imperial Government to assist the sugar cane planters affected by this cyclone. In the same year a Financial Commission visited the island to enquire into the public finances.

In 1937 a loan of Rs. 10,000,000 was raised for financing the Mauritius Agricultural Bank.

Mauritius contributed largely during the last world war, in proportion to its resources, in men and money, and by attempting to reach self-sufficiency in food production. That the latter attempt was only a partial success was largely due to a combination of adverse climatic conditions.

In the first quarter of 1945 two severe cyclones visited the island at 15 days interval. They were reckoned to be the severest storms since the calamity of 1892. Considerable damage was done to property and to crops, evaluated finally at about Rs. 14,000,000 in loan and Rs. 540,895 in relief. Valuable relief was afforded to the sugar industry by the Home Government. This disaster was quickly followed by a serious outbreak of infantile paralysis, to cope with which a team of medical experts headed by Professor Seddon of Oxford University was flown out to Mauritius.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884–85, in 1933 and again in 1947. Under the new Constitution any British subject, male or female, of 21 years or upwards, and ordinarily resident in the Colony for at least two years, is entitled to be registered as a voter if (a) he can pass a simple literacy test, or (b) has an armed forces qualification, or (c) a business premises qualification. No person may exercise more than two votes. By this extension of the franchise the number of registered electors has been increased from under 12,000 in 1944 to nearly 72,000 in 1948.

The reconstituted Executive Council consists of three ex-officio members, four unofficial members of Legislative Council selected by their fellows for appointment by the Governor and such other members as His Majesty or the Governor may appoint.

The enlarged Legislative Council, which met for the first time in September, 1948, consists of the Governor as President, three ex-officio and 31 unofficial members, twelve nominated by the Governor and nineteen elected from five electoral districts. Women are eligible to serve on the Council, and the present body includes two women, one elected and the other nominated. The question of the payment of members is under consideration. The official language of the Council is English but members may address the chair in French.

The law is based on the Code Napoleon and other French laws modified by Colonial Ordinances.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The government of Mauritius is vested in a Governor with an Executive Council and a Council Legislative (see under "Constitution"). The head of the civil service is the Colonial Secretary who is the Governor's chief adviser on administrative and political matters, while the Financial Secretary advises on financial policy. The various technical and social welfare departments of government are under the control of senior civil servants. Port Louis is administered by a municipality, constituted under Ordinance 16 of 1849. The Mayor and Deputy Mayor are elected by the Council subject to confirmation by the Governor. There are three township boards in the Plaines Wilhems district, whose members are nominated annually by the Governor. A start in rural government has been made by the appointment of three Civil Commissioners (for the north, centre and south) and under their guidance village councils are being created in the rural districts. The administration of justice rests with the Supreme Court and district courts. The former is composed of a chief judge, two puisne judges and the Master and Registrar who is also judge in bankruptcy. It deals with major civil and criminal cases, has original jurisdiction in divorce and judicial separation, and is the appellate court for decisions given by the magistrates of the district courts. The latter deal with most of the criminal matters and may sentence accused parties to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for one year, and to payment of a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000. An appeal lies to the Privy Council from decisions of the Supreme Court involving a pecuniary interest of Rs. 10,000 or more. The Privy Council can also accede to a petition for appeal in other matters.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

The local system of education was first remodelled under the provisions of Ordinance No. 33 of 1899, which repealed all former enactments.
This ordinance was repealed by Ordinance No. 19 of 1919, which itself was subsequently repealed by Ordinance 42 of 1934. As a result of a recent reorganisation of the educational system of the colony all previous legislation was repealed and new enactments issued under the provisions of Ordinance No. 12 of 1944.

By the Education Ordinance of 1899 there was created a Department of Public Instruction, under the control of a Director of Public Instruction.

This system remained in force until it was superseded by the Education Consolidation Ordinance of 1919, when the Department of Public Instruction was replaced by a Royal College Department and a Schools Department. The post of Director of Public Instruction was abolished. The Rector became the head of the Royal College Department, and the Superintendent of Schools the head of the Schools Department.

In 1940 a post of Director of Education was created and the Royal College became the College Division of the Education Department. Primary schools and secondary schools were grouped under the Schools Division of the department.

The Schools Division of the Education Department provides for primary, secondary and technical education:

(i) Primary education is provided through a system of government schools and of grant-in-aid denominational schools, the latter under the control of educational authorities.

(ii) Secondary education is provided by means of a system of approved schools for boys and girls. These schools receive grants-in-aid.

(iii) As regards technical education provision is made for the training of students in mechanical engineering.

(iv) A training college was started in 1942 for the training of teachers.

Primary and secondary education is also provided at private schools, and secondary education at the Royal College, Curepipe, and Royal College School, Port Louis.

According to the new education code, any language may be employed as the medium of teaching in lower classes of primary schools, provided that as far as possible French shall be used instead of Creole (a local vernacular derived from French). The aim is gradually and steadily to introduce the use of English as the medium of instruction in the lower classes.

In the higher classes of primary schools and in secondary schools the medium of teaching should be English. At the Royal College and the Royal College School the teaching is conducted in English.

The new Education Code was passed in 1944 and came into force in April of the same year. In accordance with the Education Ordinance of 1944, proclamations were issued to make school attendance compulsory for children of school age in a few areas where adequate facilities could be provided.

The Royal College Division comprises two day-schools for boys: the Royal College proper, situated in Curepipe, 1,800 feet above sea-level, and the Royal College School, in Port Louis. The Royal College, Curepipe, is attended by about 375 pupils, aged from 10 to 20, and has a teaching staff of 30 members. At the school there are 153 pupils on the roll with 15 teachers.

There is no technical training at the Royal College. Classes in physical culture and gymnastics are held by qualified instructors, who also supervise field sports. The pupils are drawn from all classes in the colony.

Scholarships and exhibitions tenable at the Royal College are competed for annually by primary school pupils; scholarships and exhibitions open to Royal College and other secondary school pupils are also awarded annually. Two scholarships, known as the English Scholarships, tenable at British universities and of a total value of about £1,100 are open to Royal College pupils only. Provision has been made for the award of equivalent scholarships to secondary school pupils.

The standard of the English scholarship examination corresponds roughly to that of the Cambridge Higher School Certificate but candidates are required to offer more subjects.

In December, 1946, 658 boys and girls sat for the Cambridge local examinations (junior, school certificate and higher); and 598 for the London Chamber of Commerce examinations (preliminary, certificate and higher). Examinations for external degrees of London University are held locally. In 1947, 286 candidates sat for the London matriculation examinations; 29 candidates for the intermediate examinations and one candidate for the final degree examinations.

A consultative committee styled the Education Committee is annually appointed by the Governor. It consists of nine members under the chairmanship of the Director of Education.

**Primary Education**

There were in 1946 in the Colony including Rodrigues

| Number. | Pupils. |
|---------|--------|
| Government schools | 56 | 17,388 |
| Grant schools | .. | 76 | 27,800 |
| Total | .. | 132 | 45,188 |

The total expenditure on education in 1946-47 amounted to Rs. 2,144,690 in which is included a sum of Rs. 61,661 spent on aided secondary education. There were 1,269 masters, mistresses, assistants, monitors and monitresses employed in Government and grant schools. Of the pupils in the Government and aided schools 18,561 (42·7 per cent.) are Roman Catholics, 605 (1·4 per cent.) belong to the Church of England and 202 (0·46 per cent.) to other Christian denominations.

Railways

There are seven lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government, viz.: (1) The north line from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River South East. Its length is 33½ miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Montagne Longue branch, from Terre Rouge station on the north line to the village of Montagne Longue; its length is 3½ miles. (3) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahébourg on the other side; its length is 35½ miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet at Curepipe; the gradient in many places is 1 in 26. Four miles of this line have been doubled and opened for traffic. (4) The Moka-Flacq line from the Rose Hill station on the Midland line to Montagne Blanche, length 14½ miles. (5) Savanne branch from Rose Belle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 11 miles.

Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones

Postal communication with Africa, Europe, America, India, Ceylon, Seychelles and Australia is chiefly provided by vessels sailing irregularly to South African ports, Mombasa and the United Kingdom. There is sometimes direct communication with India and Ceylon by cargo boats. Occasional surface communication with Réunion and Madagascar is provided by local trading vessels. Other opportunities are infrequent. Communication with Rodrigues is provided by local vessels every two or three months.

Air mail letters for Africa, Europe, America, India, Ceylon, Seychelles, Australia, Asia and South East Asia are forwarded weekly by Air France and Skyways Ltd., via Nairobi. The neighbouring islands of Réunion and Madagascar are served by Air France only. An air-letter service is available to all British colonies and certain foreign countries.

In Mauritius the General Post Office, the Central Railway Post Office, the Parcels Post Office, the Central Telegraph Office, the Port Louis, Eastern Suburb and the Port Louis, Western Suburb are situated in the capital, Port Louis, and there are 68 branch post offices in the rural districts. Money orders are issued in 71 of them, telegraph messages are accepted in 31, and messages are exchanged by telephone in 18. All post offices may cash postal orders but only seven may sell them. There is one post office in the island dependency of Rodrigues; lesser dependencies which are let to private companies have no post offices but prepaid letters are conveyed by the companies' ships to Port Louis.

Wireless communication is maintained with ships at sea within a range of 300 miles by day and 1,000 miles by night.

Cable communication with every part of the world is provided by Cable and Wireless Ltd. from its Port Louis cable station.

The maximum rates with Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are:

- Full rate 85 cents, CDE 60 cents (5 words minimum), deferred 45 cents (5 words minimum), letter telegrams 30 cents (25 words minimum), Empire social telegrams 30 cents (12 words minimum).

Government land telegraphs and telephones (including railway block telegraph and railway traffic control telephone) extend to 218 miles of telegraph and 6,469 miles of telephone.

The Public Telephone service is operated by the Government. There are five manual and six automatic exchanges to which 2,671 subscribers are connected.

Broadcasting

The Government also owns and operates a broadcasting station which transmits four daily programmes on both medium and short waves for the benefit of local listeners. Licensees numbered 4,433 in June, 1948. Reuter's Morse news from Rugby and the London Press Service are also monitored for distribution to the local press, broadcasting services, Government departments and units of H.M. forces.

Production and Trade

The island produces barely one-tenth of the food required for its inhabitants and almost all agricultural enterprise is devoted to the production of exports.

The chief export is sugar, and recently considerable quantities of high degree alcohol have been sent to the U.K. Other exports are aloe fibre and rum.

The main foodstuffs have recently come from Canada, Ceylon, Australia, Union of South Africa, Argentina, Brazil and Egypt; manufactured goods including a large number of motor vehicles from the U.K. and cattle from Madagascar. The imports before the war consisted mainly of grain (rice, wheat, flour, etc.), cotton manufactures, motor spirits and coal, iron and steel goods and fertilizers. The British American Tobacco Co., Ltd., have almost the whole of the manufacturing tobacco trade in their control. The manufacture of matches locally has fallen off, due largely to competition by imported matches. About 97 per cent. of the value of the exports is in respect of sugar. In 1947 the weight of sugar exported was 297,783 metric tons, estimated to be worth Rs. 89,758,970 (excluding the value of sugar quota certificates). The value of exports of Colonial Spirits amounted to Rs. 3,865,684 while the exports of aloe fibre were valued at Rs. 50,717; there was no exportation of copra or poonac. The total value of domestic exports amounted to Rs. 93,961,192.
The number of vessels registered at Port Louis of 2,650 tons. During the year, one steam vessel, at the beginning of 1947 was 9 of a total tonnage of 1,352 tons gross, was added to the Register.

**Weights and Measures**

The metric system, as regards weights and measures, came into force on 1st May, 1878.

**Dependencies**

The dependencies of Mauritius comprise a large number of islands scattered over the Indian Ocean. Rodrigues, the most important, is situated in latitude S. 19° 44′ and longitude E. 63° 34′, and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island which has an area of 42 square miles, about 26,000 acres, is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in Executive Council. The population at the census of 11th June, 1944, was 11,885. The birth rate in 1947 was 41·1 and the death rate 18·7 per 1,000. Cable communication, through a branch of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company, was opened on 16th May, 1902. This branch, now owned and operated by Cable & Wireless Limited, is connected with Mauritius and Cocos, thus providing telegraphic communication with all parts of the world through the Company’s system.

The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger.
and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good and cotton, coffee, tobacco, maize, beans and vanilla grow luxuriantly. A trained officer was appointed in 1921 agricultural superintendent in view of the agricultural development of Rodrigues. The wild guinea-fowl and partridges, likewise the deer and wild pigs, which used to be plentiful, have almost disappeared.

The value of the imports in 1947 was Rs. 1,532,950, and the exports of the island produce were valued at Rs. 819,948. The people are all peasant proprietors and there is abundance of food.

The principal exports are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, tobacco-leaf and acacia seeds.

Diego Garcia (population 501, census, 1944) the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horseshoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, 15 miles by 6½, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter. The bay is 15 miles in length from end to end, and from 2 to 5 miles in breadth.

Diego Garcia is situated at 7° 20' latitude S. and 72° 26' longitude E., roughly half-way between Mauritius and Ceylon. Diego Garcia and the other minor dependencies of Mauritius are visited periodically by a magistrate sent on tour from the main island.

The population of the smaller dependencies, according to the 1944 census, was 1,077 on 11th June, 1944.
