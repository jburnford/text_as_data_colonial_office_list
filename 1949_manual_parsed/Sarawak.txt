SARAWAK

Situation and Area
Sarawak consists of a coastal strip some 450 miles long by 40 to 120 miles in depth on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo and has an area of about 50,000 square miles. The colony lies between the broken range of mountains which runs south-west through the middle of Borneo, and the sea. The southern border with Dutch West Borneo is formed by another range of mountains running westerly from about the centre of the main range. In the north-east the territory of the colony encompasses the small sultanate of Brunei and its borders march with those of North Borneo.

Climate
The climate is uniformly warm and humid, the average temperature by day being 85° F. and the annual rainfall exceeding 100 inches. The seasons are not well defined, but the heaviest rains occur between October and March, the period of the north-east monsoon, when winds are strong and seas are rough. During the remainder of the year the rainfall is less, with occasional droughts of not more than four weeks' duration and clear sunny skies. The chief drawback to the climate is its lack of variety. The morning and early afternoon are generally bright and pleasant. Typhoons and cyclones are unknown but short squalls of rain and wind and thunderstorms are frequent. The prevailing winds blow from the north and north-east between October and March and from the south-west for the remainder of the year. It is advisable for European children to continue their education in a temperate climate after the age of about eight, partly for climatic reasons and partly because there are no special schools for the education of European children in Sarawak.

General Description
In general the country is divided into three main parts: an alluvial and swampy coastal plain, a mountainous interior, and, in between, undulating country of yellow sandy clay broken by occasional hills largely of limestone or sandstone or more rarely of granite. The coast is generally flat and low-lying with heavy vegetation and sandy or mud beaches. In a few places hills come down to the sea, forming coastal cliffs. The greater part of the territory, apart from cultivated areas, is still covered by dense jungle, some of which remains to be explored, particularly in the interior where a succession of steep broken hills culminates in peaks between 6,000 and 8,000 feet high. The whole country is intersected by numerous rivers, which afford the easiest and cheapest means of transport. The principal of these are the Rejang (navigable for 170 miles), the Baram (navigable for 100 miles), the Batang Lupar and the Limbang. The presence of bars at the mouths of all these rivers causes large vessels to experience difficulty in entering.

Mangrove occurs extensively near the mouths of the rivers, which are fringed by nipah palm along their lower courses in the coastal plain the banks being little above high water level. As the coastal swamps give way to rolling country the river banks rise above the normal high water level and in several rivers, notably the Rejang and the Baram, gorges and dangerous rapids occur at considerable distances from the sources.

Sarawak is essentially an agricultural country. Rubber represents about 60 per cent. of the value of the total exports. Large quantities of sago flour are also exported. Rice is cultivated extensively for local consumption. The agricultural production of the colony is almost entirely in the hands of native cultivators, and there are very few European estates. Miri, which is situated about 15 miles to the south-west of the Baram River, owes its existence to the activities of the Sarawak Oilfields, Limited. During the war the oilfield was severely damaged and the prosperous town of Miri was almost entirely destroyed. The work of reconstruction has been undertaken by the oil company with commendable vigour and the Sarawak portion of the oilfield, which extends into Brunei territory, is again in production, although on a smaller scale than formerly.

Before the war gold was worked on a commercial scale, but the progress of rehabilitation has been slow and very few mines are at present in production.

All the non-Malay indigenous races, with the exception of the Melanaus, live in long or communal houses, which may be inhabited by anything from five to fifty or more families. The long-houses are usually constructed of wood, with pillars and sometimes floors of Borneo iron wood, a hard wood of great durability that is found in considerable quantities in the interior, and with shingle roofs of the same material.
Each long-house consists of a number of "doors," or rooms, each of which contains a family. These rooms are connected by a common verandah occupied by the bachelors of the community.

Malays live in houses of sound construction and simple design, situated preferably on the banks of tidal rivers. The coastal Malays and Melanau frequently combine agriculture with fishing. The bulk of the import and export trade is in the hands of the Chinese, who are, however, also engaged in almost every other occupation which is open to the inhabitants of the colony.

Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, in the southwest corner of the territory, is an attractively laid-out town, with a population of about 38,000, situated about 18 miles from the mouth of the Sarawak river. Its trading community is almost entirely composed of Chinese and there are large Malay villages within the municipal limits.

Sibu, the second largest town in the colony, with a population of about 10,000, is situated at the entrance to the Iban country at the head of the Rejang delta and about 80 miles from its western mouth.

**POPULATION**

With the exception of enumeration proceedings conducted for a food control organisation towards the end of 1939, no census had been carried out until 1947, when a full scale population census of the country was effected. The Census Report is in process of preparation and should be available at the end of 1948, and the following figures are taken from the draft of the Report:

|                | Male | Female | Total | Percentage increase since 1939 |
|----------------|------|--------|-------|-------------------------------|
| European       | 398  | 293    | 691   | 1·8                           |
| Malay          | 48,459| 49,010 | 97,469|                               |
| Melanau        | 17,440| 18,120 | 35,560| 2·7                           |
| Sea Dayak      | 94,232| 96,094 | 190,326| 13·5                          |
| Land Dayak     | 21,032| 21,163 | 42,195| 14·2                          |
| Other indigenous| 15,096| 14,771 | 29,867| 8·5                           |
| Chinese        | 81,392| 63,766 | 145,158| 17·4                          |
| Other non-indigenous Asiatic | 3,121 | 1,998 | 5,119 | 11·8                          |

The group "Other indigenous" above is composed of the following "tribes":

- Bisayah
- Kedayan
- Kayan
- Kenyah
- Kelabit
- Murut
- Dusun
- Belait
- Bukitan
- Kajaman
- Lahanan
- Penan
- Rajang
- Sekapan
- Sian
- Tatau
- Nomadic Punan

- Nomadic Punan: 1,833

Total: 29,867

The languages in common use are English, Malay, Iban, Chinese, Land Dayak, Melanau and Kayan, but there are numerous dialects in use among the smaller tribes.

**RELIGION**

The Malays are Mohammadans but, although sincere in their faith and conscientious in its observances, are by no means bigots. They are tolerant of other creeds and associate on terms of complete friendliness with those professing other religious beliefs. Many Melanau have also accepted Islam. Anglican and Roman Catholic Missions have been working in the territory for many years, particularly in Kuching, and among the Chinese and the pagan tribes. The Borneo Evangelical Mission (inter-denominational), American Methodist Mission, Sibu, and the Seventh Day Adventist Missions also operate in various parts of the country. The Rt. Rev. the Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak and the Prefect Apostolic reside in Kuching.

**HISTORY**

The theory has recently been advanced that Yavadvipa, the "land of gold and silver" of the Ramayana, Ptolemy's labadiou, and Ye-po-ii, which was visited by the Chinese Buddhist monk Fa-Hien in 413–414 A.D., all refer to the western part of Borneo, the country lying between Kuching and the State of Sambas in Dutch Borneo. No archaeological exploration has been undertaken in Sarawak, but its geographical position and the discovery in Dutch Borneo of Indian inscriptions, both Hindu and Buddhist, some of which are believed to date back to 400 A.D., leave little room for doubt that Sarawak was visited, and probably settled in, by the early Indian colonists. Chinese settlers also seem to have come at an early date, and it is possible that the Mongol Empire, under the successors of Genghis Khan, extended its sway temporarily over the country. The western part of Sarawak certainly fell under the rule of the Hindu-Javanese Empire of Majapahit (circa 1300 to 1500, A.D.) : Hindu figures have been found at Santubong and Hindu gold ornaments up the Sarawak River; and the Land Dayaks of the First Division, by their abstention from the flesh of cattle and by the name of their god Jiwata (Hindu deva) show that at one time they were brought into intimate contact with the Hindus.

After the fall of Majapahit Sarawak formed part of the dominions of the Malay Sultan of Brunei, and it is first known to us by name through the visits to Brunei of Pigafetta in 1521, of Jorge de Menezes in 1526 and of Gonsalvo Pereira in 1530, and by an early map of the East Indies by Mercator.

Its history as an integral State, however, begins with the first landing in August, 1839, of James Brooke, an affluent young Englishman in search of adventure. At that time Sarawak was the southern province of the Malay Sultanate of Brunei. The oppression of the viceroy of the Sultan of Brunei had goaded the Malays and Land Dayaks resident in the area known as Sarawak Proper into revolt. James Brooke interceded in the dispute, brought about a settlement and sailed away. He returned in the following year to find that fighting had been resumed, and, interceding again, at the request of the Sultan's uncle, Pengiran Muda Hashim, who had been sent to pacify the region, was rewarded for his services by being installed on 24th September, 1841, as
Rajah of the territory from Cape Datu to the Samarahan River under the suzerainty of the Sultan. His appointment was ratified by a Deed signed by the Sultan at Brunei on 1st August, 1842. Three years later the Sultan renounced his rights of suzerainty over Sarawak. Thereafter for the remaining twenty-three years of his life Rajah Brooke devoted himself to the suppression of piracy and head-hunting, often with the assistance of the ships of the Royal Navy, which performed almost incredible feats of navigation and endurance. Sarawak was recognised as an Independent State by the United States of America in 1850 and by Great Britain in 1864. In 1861 the territory of Sarawak was enlarged by the Sultan’s cession of all rivers and lands from the Sadong River to Kedurong Point.

The first Rajah, at his death in 1868, bequeathed to his nephew and successor, Charles Brooke, a country paternally governed with a solid foundation of mutual trust and affection between ruler and ruled. Sir James Brooke pioneered, subdued and pacified; Sir Charles Brooke, in a long reign of fifty years, built upon the foundations laid by his uncle with such conspicuous success that piracy disappeared, head-hunting was greatly reduced and the prosperity of the country increased by leaps and bounds.

Further large accretions of territory occurred in 1882, when the frontier was advanced beyond the Baram River, in 1885, when the valley of the Trusun River was ceded, and in 1890 when the Limbang River was annexed at the request of the inhabitants. In 1905 the Lawas River was purchased from the British North Borneo Chartered Company with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

Between 1870 and 1917 the revenue rose from $122,842 to $1,705,292, and the expenditure from $126,161 to $1,359,746. The public debt was wiped out and a considerable surplus accumulated. In 1870 imports were valued at $1,494,241 and exports at $1,328,963. In 1917 imports totalled $4,999,320 and exports $6,283,071. Roads had been constructed, pipe water supplies laid down and telephones and the wireless telegraph had been introduced.

Progress in all spheres continued during the rule of the third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, who succeeded his father in 1917. Medical and educational services in particular were greatly improved. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound financial position with a large sum of money in reserve. As a centenary gesture the Rajah enacted a new constitution, which abrogated his absolute powers, and set the feet of his subjects on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

The Japanese invasion and occupation was a catastrophe. Social services and communications were neglected; education ceased to exist; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State. Although Sarawak, with the exception of the oilfield area, suffered far less material damage from allied air bombardment than the neighbouring territories of Brunei and British North Borneo, all traces of its former prosperity disappeared and its inhabitants were reduced to poverty and misery. After the unconditional surrender of Japan, Australian forces entered Kuching on 11th September, 1945. For seven months Sarawak was administered by a British military administration, as a result of whose vigorous efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed, and the medical and educational services reorganised. The Rajah resumed the reins of government on 15th April, 1946. It had, however, for some time been evident to him that Sarawak could not, by her own resources, regain a semblance of her former prosperity. He therefore decided that the time had come to hand the country over to the care of the British Crown, and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May, 1946, and passed by a small majority. By an Order-in-Council the State of Sarawak became a British Colony on 1st July, 1946.

CONSTITUTION

In 1941 the Rajah divested himself of his autocratic authority and granted a Constitution to Sarawak by which legislative and financial authority was conferred upon the Council Negri (legislative assembly) and executive authority upon the Supreme Council. The Constitution now consists of a Governor, a Supreme Council consisting of 12 members, and a Council Negri composed at present of 14 official members (including the Chief Secretary (President), Financial Secretary, the five divisional residents, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, the Secretary for Native Affairs and five members appointed by name), 11 unofficial members and 15 standing members.

ADMINISTRATION

The Colony is divided into five divisions, which are administered by Residents, with headquarters at Kuching, Simanggang, Sibu, Miri and Limbang. These divisions are sub-divided into districts which are administered by District Officers or Native Officers. Since the territory became a Colony, Divisional and District Advisory Councils together with a Chinese Advisory Board in Kuching, have been constituted and plans have been drawn up for the establishment of Native Authorities, which will have control over their own finances. Five Native Authorities have already been established.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

At the end of 1947 there were 72 Government Schools with 4,416 pupils, 58 Mission Schools with 5,087 pupils, 192 Chinese Schools with 19,522 pupils, and 8 Private Schools with 591 pupils. Post-primary instruction was provided at 1 Government School, 5 Mission Schools and 10 Chinese Schools, but the number of pupils in these sections was only 835 out of a total school population of 29,616. The first Native Authority Schools were established during 1948.

Before the war the Government Schools catered almost entirely for Malays and Melanaus, but an increasing number of schools is now being provided for the other indigenous peoples. The Mission Schools cater mainly for Chinese in the towns, but recently there has been considerable expansion of the rural-school system for the indigenous peoples in backward areas. The Chinese Schools are generally conducted by voluntary committees, and the curriculum is similar to that of schools in China. There is no College or University, but scholarships are available to enable selected students to continue their studies in institutions overseas.
There is no compulsory education. School fees are charged at most Mission and Chinese Schools, but education is provided free at the Government Schools. Grants from Government funds are paid to most Mission Schools and to selected Chinese Schools. The Schools Ordinance provides for the registration of all schools and teachers, and Regulations govern the standards of accommodation, curriculum and inspection of schools.

With financial assistance under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, a Government Teacher-training Centre and Secondary School has been established in Kuching, and a Rural Improvement School at Kanowit.

**Information Services**

There is no Information Department in Sarawak. A Secretariat Officer has been nominated Information Officer and information services are being established. The Information Officer maintains close contact with the Press and distributes to local associations and cinemas publications and films received from the Information Department in the Colonial Office.

**Health**

There are hospitals at Kuching, Sibu and Miri. The Kuching General Hospital with a bed potential of 350 operates at present, owing to staff shortage, to 250 beds. It is the most highly developed medical institution in the country and has attached to it the departmental laboratory. It is also the training centre for dressers and nurses. Within the hospital compound is sited the Mental Hospital which is capable of accommodating 120 patients.

Near Kuching is the Leper Settlement which accommodates some 370 persons.

Twenty-two outstation dispensaries, to which are attached a varying number of rest beds up to a maximum of sixteen, serve the more remote areas, but there are parts of the Colony to which medical services have not yet penetrated. Deficiencies in this regard will be partially met by the full implementation of a scheme for the provision of travelling dispensaries being carried out with Colonial Development and Welfare funds. These travelling dispensaries, of which two are already in operation, are in native craft powered by outboard motors and will ply on the rivers taking simple remedies to the more remote places.

There are 25 registered medical practitioners in the Colony. All but one of these practise in the towns of Kuching, Sibu and Miri.

Environmented hygiene is the responsibility of the Medical Department and activities are so far largely confined to the towns where sanitary inspectors are posted.

Births and deaths are compulsorily registrable throughout the Colony under the Births and Deaths Registration Ordinance, but, by reason of distance and difficulties of communication, registration is, as yet, incomplete.

**Labour**

The Secretary for Chinese Affairs performs the duties of Protector of Labour, and District Officers are Deputy Protectors. Workers are protected by the Labour Protection and the Labour Conventions Ordinances. A Trade Union Ordinance was enacted in 1947 and has recently been brought into force. Factory legislation is dealt with under the Dangerous Machinery Ordinance.

The only large single employer of labour is the Sarawak Oilfields Limited, which employs some 1,800 workmen. For the rest, organised employment is confined to sago production, logging, sawmills, dock work and the distribution of imported goods.

**Welfare**

There is as yet no Social Welfare Department. An Advisory Committee has, however, recently been appointed to advise on and consider further extension of social welfare work. Government charity votes are operated throughout the Colony by Administrative Officers for the relief of the needy. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs, in his capacity of Protector of Labour and Protector of Women and Girls, controls funds for the relief of distress.

Government has for many years maintained a Pauper Institution, which is mainly occupied by Chinese, as the indigenous peoples almost invariably look after their own poor. The Leper Camp, administered by the Medical Department, contains some 350 inmates of all races. A home has recently been opened for male juvenile offenders, organised on modern reformatory lines, where the boys are not confined in any way and receive regular instruction. In the Rural Improvement School at Kanowit, mentioned above, a number of Iban (Sea Dayak) couples are receiving a two-year course of training in agriculture, hygiene and every aspect of social welfare applicable to the indigenous communities.

Among voluntary organisations, a branch of the British Red Cross Society has recently been opened in Kuching, and is organised on all-community lines. At Sibu in the Third Division a Benevolent Society operates a lodge and nursing home for the sick and destitute, with the assistance of a monthly grant from the Government.

**Communications**

**Roads**

The road system is not extensive. The main centres of population are not connected by roads, freight and passenger communications between them being maintained by river and sea transport. Except in the Kuching district and at Miri unsurfaced earth roads are the general rule. Light motor vehicles are used on these roads where passable but their use is of necessity restricted.

**Water**

The rivers and sea afford the principal means of communication. The rivers are in fact the main "trunk roads" of the country. Steamship services ply between Kuching and coastal ports and also serve Sibu and other Rejang river ports. In addition numerous powered small craft, chiefly owned by Chinese, carry passengers and cargo to places further upriver and beyond their range other smaller boats driven by outboard motors make their way far into the interior. Native "perahu" of all shapes and sizes are very numerous. The "perahu" is the common man's "Baby Austin."

Regular steamship services of the Sarawak Steamship Co. and the Straits Steamship Co. run from Kuching, Sibu and Miri direct to Singapore. The tonnage of vessels entering and leaving Sarawak from and to foreign ports during the year 1947 was 1,047,317 and 1,005,997 respectively.
Air

Prior to the Japanese occupation landing grounds existed at Kuching and Miri suitable for the operation of medium aircraft. Both were heavily damaged by air bombardment, but the Kuching airfield has been repaired for use in cases of necessity and emergency. A scheme has recently been approved, financed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, for the construction of a new airstrip at Kuching with necessary airport buildings, and work has already begun. Air communication with Singapore and Labuan is at present maintained by means of Sunderland flying boats of the Royal Air Force using the Sarawak River at Pending as their landing area.

Posts and Telegraphs

The Posts and Telegraphs Department is under the control of the Postmaster-General at Kuching. There are 35 Post Offices—Kuching, Serian, Simunjan, Bau, Lundu, Simanggang, Lingga, Engkilili, Lubok Antu, Betong, Debak, Spaoh, Pusa, Saratok, Kabong, Sibu, Rejang, Truscan, Sarikei, Binatang, Matu, Daro, Kapit, Kanowit, Meluan, Song, Mukah, Balingian, Oya, Dalat, Bintulu, Miri, Baram, Limbang, Lawas.

Postal communication is established with Europe, America, Australia, etc., via Singapore by steamers on an irregular schedule. There is also a similar steamer service to Brunei and North Borneo.

A weekly airmail service with Singapore, Labuan and Jesselton is at present maintained by R.A.F. flying boats.

There is no landline telegraph in Sarawak.

There are 19 radiotelegraph stations—Kuching, Lundu, Simanggang, Saratok, Sibu, Sarikei, Kanowit, Kapit, Belaga, Meluan, Selalang, Matu, Makah, Balingian, Miri, Bintulu, Baram, Limbang, Lawas.

Radiotelegraph communication is also established with Singapore, Jesselton and Brunei.

Cable communication is established with countries beyond Singapore.

The telegraph rates to Empire countries are:

- Ordinary full rate (plain language per word) $0.55 cents.
- Code (Cde) $0.35
- Deferred $0.30
- Government Ordinary full rate (plain language) $0.30
- Government Code (Cde) $0.20
- Night or Daily Letter Telegram NLT/DT $5.00
- Greetings Letter Telegram $2.00

There are 40 telephone exchanges in local centres with 383 telephones connected. 275 telephones are in use in Government Offices and bungalows.

The total length of telephone lines is 617 miles in aerial cable and 1,516 on open wire circuits.

Public Finance

The Colony has no public debt. Approximately two-thirds of the revenue is derived from Customs import and export duties; other sources are licences and taxes, which include revenue obtained from the granting of monopolies for the sale of arrack, and revenue from Government property. Before the war one-sixth of the total revenue was derived from gambling and opium monopolies, which were abolished by the British Military Administration when Sarawak was re-occupied in 1945. Income tax has not yet been introduced, and the only direct taxes are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year and the Malay "head tax" of $1, which is levied on all males of working age.

In the middle of 1947 a conference of the Borneo territories of Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo, was held with the aim of devising, so far as individual local conditions permitted, a unified tariff. The new tariffs were introduced into Sarawak in December, 1947. Among the commodities subject to import duty are liquor, tobacco, petroleum and petroleum products, sugar, flour, salt, tea, coffee, tinned meats, soap, cosmetics and perfumery, textiles, matches, musical instruments, cameras, electrical and wireless apparatus, vehicles, timber and furniture. Export duty is imposed on birds' nests, copra, damar, fish (dried and salted), guano, jelutong, illipe nuts, pepper, sago and rubber.

The main heads of expenditure are Pensions and Provident Fund, Public Works, Medical and Health Department, Constabulary and District Administration.

Comparative figures of revenue and expenditure since 1937 are given below. The figures for 1946 cover only the last nine months of the year.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | $4,261,899 | $4,272,140 |
| 1939 | $4,762,532 | $4,200,269 |
| 1940 | $7,463,314 | $5,018,006 |
| 1946 | $5,569,690 | $6,046,991 |
| 1947* | $12,318,383 | $11,312,961 |

* Revised estimates.

Currency and Banking

The unit of currency is the Straits Settlements dollar which is divided into 100 cents. The value of the dollar is at present fixed at two shillings and fourpence. Before the war Sarawak had its own issue of treasury notes. In order to provide a uniform currency for the invading Allied troops throughout British Borneo, an agreement was reached in 1944 that, when the territories of Sarawak, Brunei, Labuan and North Borneo were reoccupied Malayan currency should be supplied for use. It was expected that the Japanese would have withdrawn most of the local currency from circulation, but when Sarawak was reoccupied, surprisingly large amounts of local currency reappeared. It was intended that, as soon as the Civil Government of the Rajah was restored, Sarawak notes should be reintroduced. But after the cession of the State to the Crown it was agreed that Sarawak notes should be gradually withdrawn as they became unfit for circulation and that fresh issues should consist of Malayan notes obtained from the Malayan Currency Commissioners. The amount of currency in circulation at the end of 1947 was estimated to be $14,772,000, of which $5,767,000 was pre-war Sarawak issue and $9,005,000 Malayan currency introduced since the re-occupation of the territory in September, 1945.

Banking facilities are afforded by the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, in Kuching and Sibu, and on 1st January, 1948, a branch of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation was opened in Kuching. There are also a number of local Chinese Banks.
PRODUCTION AND TRADE

The chief agricultural products of Sarawak are rice, sago, pepper, rubber, coconuts and pineapples. Local production of rice satisfies about two-thirds of the country's needs, but is increasing. Rubber is the chief tree crop and Sarawak's most important export. Sago flour is an important export and production is at present at a high level. Pepper of good quality was produced for export before the war, but the gardens were largely abandoned during the Japanese occupation and production is now negligible; some progress is however being made with the rehabilitation of the industry.

The forests produce firewood and a fair quality of timber. Minor products are jelutong, a wild latex used in the manufacture of chewing-gum, and illipe nuts, from which is obtained a valuable vegetable fat used as a constituent in the making of "cream" for chocolates and of cosmetics.

Oil is obtained in the Fourth Division by Sarawak Oilfields Limited on a concession from the Government. Gold is also worked by small Chinese syndicates, mostly from alluvial pockets. Coal deposits exist in the country and investigations have recently been carried out by experts.

The only major industry is the refining of oil. Minor industries include the manufacture of matches, soap and aerated water and the curing of fish. Towards the end of 1947 a chemical factory was established near Kuching for the manufacture of acetic acid and alcohol from mangrove and nipah sugar.

Trade figures for recent years are:

| Year | Imports       | Exports       |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 1940 | $32,645,192   | $45,770,407   |
| 1946 | $28,796,092   | $27,558,673   |
| 1947 | $72,254,705   | $103,138,575  |

Note.—† For 9 months only.

The apparently favourable trade balance of $30,883,870 for 1947 does not give a clear picture of the position, as exports and re-exports of petroleum account for no less than $51,225,640 of the total exports. Similarly $29,541,206 of the imports are accounted for by crude oil won in the neighbouring territory of Brunei and piped to the refinery in Sarawak. Next to petroleum, the chief imports are foodstuffs and manufactured goods, and the chief exports rubber, sago flour, pepper (from pre-war stocks) and jelutong.
