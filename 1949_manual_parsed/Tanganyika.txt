TANGANYIKA

Situation and Area

Tanganyika consists of that portion of the former colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the colony, namely the territory of Ruanda-Urundi in the North-west, and the Kionga area, south of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. Tanganyika extends from the Umba River on the north to the Rovuma River on the south, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands.

The northern boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of south latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Rubabe Peninsula), thence along the first parallel of south latitude until it meets the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River up stream to its junction with the Kakitumba River thence along the eastern boundary of the Belgian mandated territory of Ruanda-Urundi to a point on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika at approximately 4° 27' south latitude. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the median line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows in a southerly direction to the mouth of the Kalambo River at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to the mouth of the Songwe River at the north end of Lake Nyasa. Thence it follows the shore of the lake, first in a northerly and then in a southerly direction, to a point on the eastern shore of the lake at approximately 11° 35' south latitude, thence the boundary runs in an easterly direction to the Rovuma River whose course it follows to the sea.

The total area of the Territory is 362,688 square miles which includes 19,982 square miles of water.

The island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

CLIMATE

The climate of the Territory varies greatly, and particularly with altitude. There are, very generally, four climatic zones: (1) the coast and its immediate hinterland, (2) the area between the coast and the central plateau, roughly 300 feet to 2,000 feet above sea level, (3) the central plateau, mainly between 2,000 feet and 4,000 feet and (4) the highland areas such as the slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru, the Usambaras, Ufipa and the Southern Highlands.

The average temperature at the coast is 78° F. or 79° F., and the average annual temperature decreases roughly 3° F. per 1,000 feet increase in altitude. The range of temperature, however, increases both with distance from the coast and with altitude, so that the mean maximum and minimum temperatures at the coast are 86° and 71°, while at Tabora (4,000 feet) they are 84° and 63°, and at Sao Hill (6,500 feet) 71° and 52°. Inland, nights are cool, and frost may occur above 6,000 feet.

In zone (1) as described above, the average annual rainfall varies from over 60 inches in the north to 35 inches in the south; in the north the rainy season is March to May, with no completely dry period, while in the south the rainy season is from November to April, with a pronounced dry spell from June to October.

In zones (2) and (3), the average rainfall varies from just over 20 inches to just under 40 inches, the rainy season being generally November to April, with a warm and sunny dry season from June to October. In the highland areas the rainfall is greater than on the plateau and the dry season, where it occurs, is cooler.

At the coast, the hot humid conditions in the three months before the rains break are trying for Europeans, but the cool season of June to August is generally pleasant. The highland areas only, however, enjoy a bracing climate and are generally healthy for Europeans.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,534 feet, Nyasa, 1,568 feet), which form part of the Albertine and Great Rift valley systems respectively.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 66,379) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which is situated at the junction of the old caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and
Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mbeya, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway and Ujiji, on Tanganyika.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilimanjaro, which rises to 19,565 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,799 feet). In the south-west is the Kipengere Range where the highest peak is 9,715 feet and Rungwe Mountain (9,713 feet).

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz., the southern portion of Lake Victoria and most of the eastern portion of Lake Tanganyika. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

**Population**

The number of Europeans, including Polish and other refugees, in Tanganyika as at 31st December, 1947, was approximately 16,883. There are also approximately 61,960 Asiatics, chiefly Indians, Arabs and Goans. The natives are estimated at 5,838,210. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important language is Swahili, which is a hybrid between Arabic and Persian and all sorts of African tongues. It is more or less spoken as a Lingua Franca from Aden to the north to Durban in the south and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but the majority of the coastal tribes and a few in the hinterland profess Mohammedanism and certain areas are predominantly Christian.

The territory is divided into eight provinces as follows:

| Provinces          | Capital     | Approx. Native Population |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Central            | Dodoma      | 641,979                  |
| Eastern            | Dar-es-Salaam | 672,950                 |
| Southern Highlands |             |                          |
| Province           | Mbeya       | 561,000                  |

| Totals             |             | 5,838,210                |

**Religion**

The majority of the inhabitants of the Territory, are pagans. Common features among many tribal beliefs are a belief in a supreme being and in the possibility of communion with the spirits of the departed.

There is a large African Moslem population to be found chiefly in the coastal areas and in the up-country trading settlements. They are followers of the Sunni school.

Christian missions are active and numerous in the territory. It is estimated that at end of the year 1947 Christian Africans numbered at least 889,409, of whom some 666,282 were Roman Catholic. The principal Roman Catholic missions now operating in the territory are the White Fathers, the Society of the Holy Ghost, the Capuchin Fathers, the Swiss Benedictines, the Consolata Fathers and the Passionist Fathers.

The principal Protestant missions are the Universities Mission to Central Africa, the Church Missionary Society, the Moravian Mission and the Augustana Lutheran Mission.

Among the immigrant Indian population the majority are Hindus, Sikhs and Moslem Khoja Ismailias and Ithnashiris.

**History**

Plentiful evidence exists of Arab traders having visited the Territory for several centuries and of their opening up the great slave route from Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. The British explorer, Burton, first entered the Territory in 1856, and was soon followed by Speke, Livingstone and Stanley.

Tanganyika was visited in 1884 by Dr. Kar Peters, who made 12 treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilimanjaro and occupied Moshi on 13th March of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on 1st January, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in 1919 appointing an Administrator, The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on 25th September, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council. In 1921 the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ufipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

**Constitution**

In 1920 draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain laid down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of
native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It provided that nationals of states members of the League of Nations should have complete commercial equality. An annual report was made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated 19th March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council (in addition to the Executive Council established by the Order in Council of 1920) consisting of the Governor as President, 13 official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on 1st July, 1926.

A further Order in Council which came into operation on 23rd November, 1945, altered the constitution of the Council to consist of the Governor as President, 15 official members and not more than 14 unofficial members. The first African members of the Legislative Council—two in number—took their seats in Council on 3rd December, 1945, and a third African Chief was appointed an unofficial member of the Council on 13th June, 1947. A fourth African member was appointed on 1st April, 1948.

In January, 1946, His Majesty's Government announced to the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations their intention of placing Tanganyika under the international trusteeship system established by the United Nations Charter, and the Trusteeship Agreement was formally approved by the United Nations General Assembly on 13th December, 1946. Its terms are similar to those of the League of Nations Mandate. The first Mission of the Trusteeship Council visited Tanganyika in August, 1948.

NATIVE ADMINISTRATION

The form of native administration operating in Tanganyika varies from the system commonly known as "Indirect Rule", under which hereditary chiefs are constituted native authorities under a Native Authority Ordinance, to a system of government-nominated headmen, who are similarly constituted native authorities, mainly in areas where the tradition of hereditary rule is either lacking or ineffective. These native authorities normally exercise their judicial and other functions with the aid of councils or elders or advisers, on which popular representation is increasingly finding a place, the electoral principle having already been introduced in several areas.

Native authorities may be described as falling roughly into four classes. The first is the traditional chief and his council, who may be responsible for a large area and many thousands of subjects. He may have a native treasury under his own control, or may share a common treasury with neighbouring chiefs of the same tribe. Secondly, certain federations of chiefs are recognised as native authorities; each chief is the authority in his own unit and retains independent executive and judicial powers, but the members of the federation combine for certain purposes, principally to achieve unity of administration and development, to constitute a joint treasury, and for the passing of rules and orders applicable throughout the federation. Thirdly, there is the tribal council, consisting of petty headmen belonging to the same tribe and with a common treasury. Finally, mainly in urban and coastal areas where little or no indigenous tribal structure exists, there is the government-nominated headman or "liwali", whose powers are similar to those exercised by the chiefs in the first group described above.

In addition to the general obligation, in cooperation with the central Government, to maintain order and prevent crime in the areas under their jurisdiction, native authorities may issue executive orders or rules on a variety of matters. They also act as arms or agencies of the central Government in the discharge of a number of its social activities and responsibilities.

The resources of the native treasuries consist in a rebate on the house and poll tax collected in their areas, native court fees and local dues such as ferry and market fees. In 1948 the estimated total revenue accruing to the treasuries from these and other sources amounted to £353,506. The total expenditure, including the amount spent on capital works financed from surplus balances, was estimated at £376,508. The surplus balances at the end of the year are estimated to amount to £453,983.

The native courts, which form an integral part of the system of local government described above, are constituted under a Native Courts Ordinance. They are given limited jurisdiction to try cases in which both parties are natives, in accordance with native law and custom. Their proceedings are subject to inspection by administrative officers who are also empowered to revise their decisions. Appeals lie to the executive authorities and not to the High Court. All fees and fines collected are paid into the native treasuries. In 1947, these courts dealt with a total of 105,155 cases, of which 52,982 were civil cases and 52,173 were cases of a criminal nature.

The flexibility of the organisation of the native administration on both its executive and its judicial side has been preserved and its structure has not yet taken final shape. There has been a progressive integration of the traditional native institutions into the general administrative system, as is shown by the growing use of rules and orders issued by the native authorities to serve the purposes of government. At the same time steps are being taken, so far as possible without doing violence to the indigenous tribal structure, to introduce an increasing measure of popular representation in local government councils. At the present stage of development there is, not unnaturally, a marked inequality in the efficiency of the different native authorities, and the character of the native administrations as a whole may be said to vary with the inherent ability of the tribe concerned, its political history and record of previous achievement in self-development, and the extent of the supervision it has enjoyed since the beginning of European administration.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

European

Three schools are maintained by Government for the primary education of European children at Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mbeya (the last two being boarding schools). A correspondence course, which also serves other East African territories, for children in the remoter districts, is conducted from Dar es Salaam. Assistance is given to eight privately maintained schools, one English, two Afrikaans, one Greek, one Goan (61 European children including kindergarten) and three kindergarten schools. The total enrolment is approximately 782 pupils. For secondary education European children proceed to schools in Kenya. Bursaries are awarded for secondary education in Kenya and South Africa.
Indian

There are 83 Indian schools with a total enrolment of approximately 9,831 pupils. Grant-in-aid is paid in respect of staff, buildings and equipment. Eighty schools are on the grant-earning list. Thirty-eight of these are maintained by H.H. Agakhan's Central Council of Education. Thirty-five are so-called Indian public schools (i.e., non-denominational), three are Ithnasheri, two Bohora, one Khalsa Girls' and one Devkunver Girls' school. Instruction in the lower standards is conducted in Gujarati or Urdu, and in the higher standards in English. At the Government school in Dar es Salaam and at two other schools the curriculum is designed to take pupils to the Cambridge School Certificate Examination. There are also three Agakhan Nursery Schools with 325 pupils, two Goan schools (one unaided) with enrolment of approximately 596 (187 Indian).

African

Schools for Africans are provided by Government, the native administrations and voluntary societies, the two latter being subsidised by a grant-in-aid system controlled by the Education Department. Two hundred and eighty-nine schools are maintained by Government or the native authorities, including eight secondary schools, five of which have Industrial Sections attached, and nine girls' schools (four Government girls' schools having the full primary course with teacher training, one with secondary standards and four Government girls' village schools). Primary schools are usually co-educational. The total enrolment is approximately 32,323 pupils. Assistance is given to 704 schools including secondary schools, teacher training centres and girls' schools run by voluntary agencies. The total roll is approximately 80,875 pupils. In the secondary schools the medium of instruction is English. A few of the schools give a six-years' course at the end of which students may sit for the Makerere College, Uganda, entrance examination. After four years of the secondary course many students enter Government departments where they are given further technical instruction, and some proceed to the clerical course of one year at Dar es Salaam secondary school in which boys intended for the local civil service are taught office routine, accountancy, typewriting and shorthand.

There are two Government Training Centres which train teachers for the Grade II Certificate and three Centres which deal only with the first two years of the course. In the primary schools, stress is placed on the improvement of rural economy and many village schools have their gardens. Industrial Sections at the secondary schools teach carpentry, masonry, smithing and tailoring.

The total revised estimates of expenditure on education in 1947 was £254,429, exclusive of further sums contributed by the native authorities and voluntary agencies.

The Government publishes a monthly journal in Swahili to disseminate news and useful information among the vernacular speaking population.

Staff

The European staff of the Education Department includes a director, deputy director, chief inspector, senior education officers, education officers, headmasters, masters, chief inspector of women's education, women education officers, headmistresses, mistresses, matrons, mistress correspondence course, office superintendent, industrial instructors and clerical instructors.

The Indian staff comprises headmasters, inspectors, assistant masters, office assistant and clerks.

There are 1,152 teachers, industrial instructors and clerks on the African establishment.

Further information is contained in the annual report of the Education Department, Tanganyika, 1947.

Inter-Territorial Language (Swahili) Committee

(See under East Africa High Commission)

Information Services

A small Information Department is mainly concerned with the presentation of world news and local information to Africans by means of a monthly illustrated paper "Mambo Leo" which has a circulation of 26,500 and is sold at 10 cents per copy, and a weekly newsheet "Habari za Leo" which is distributed gratis and has a circulation of 20,000. A mobile cinema tours the country and attracts gigantic audiences. In addition news reels and other information films are distributed to commercial cinemas and non-commercial projectors.

Communiques and a press service are distributed to the local press and daily broadsheets of the latest news are prepared in the vernacular and distributed by air mail to the largest towns.

Photographs and films of local subjects are taken for local use as well as for use in the United Kingdom.

Health

Medical Headquarters is located at the capital, Dar es Salaam, and the administration of the department is carried on through eight provincial medical officers located as a rule at the provincial headquarters. Medical attention is given free to the native population and to government officials. There are 12 European hospitals and 60 native ones, which include the infectious diseases hospitals and maternity clinics at Dar es Salaam and Tanga. Rural medicine is carried on through a chain of dispensaries, most of which are financed from native treasury funds. There are 49 Government and 361 Native Authority dispensaries. Medical Officers of Health are maintained in the larger towns; in smaller places such duties fall upon the local medical officer. Specialist services are established at Dar es Salaam and Tanga, and include medicine, surgery and ophthalmology. At Kibongoto in the Northern Province there is a special hospital for tuberculosis cases, and mental hospitals have been established at Dodoma and Lutindi. A specialist in trypanosomiasis is stationed at Tabora, and at Tinde there is an inter-territorial research station; while a territorial anti-malaria unit has its headquarters at Muheza under a specialist malariologist. Dental surgeons are stationed in Dar es Salaam and Tanga.

Medical services are also maintained by many of the missions working in the territory, some of which have built excellent and well-equipped hospitals. These are assisted by grants-in-aid from government funds. The number of beds in government hospitals is 3,967, and in mission hospitals 3,113.

A central laboratory exists in Dar es Salaam and smaller ones at most of the provincial head-quarter stations.
A medical officer has been seconded to the Labour Department as a specialist in industrial conditions to maintain liaison with that department.

Training of Africans for subordinate medical work in connection with hospital services is carried on in Dar es Salaam. Schools for staffing the rural dispensary services exist at Mwanza and Tukuyu. Training of African nurses both male and female is undertaken in Dar es Salaam and of female African nurses only in Tanga. Some nursing training is also carried on by missions.

Further details are available in the Annual Reports of the Medical Department.

Labour

The Labour Department now consists of two divisions—Labour and Training—and is in charge of the Labour Commissioner.

The Labour Division has an authorized staff comprising two Deputy Labour Commissioners, 18 Labour Officers, an Electrical Engineer, and Assistant Electrical Engineer, a Factory Inspector, a Medical Specialist seconded from the Medical Department, an Office Superintendent, three Stenographers and subordinate Asian and African staff.

Labour Officers are posted at the following Centres:

Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Kilosa, Dodoma, Tabora, Mwanza, Arusha, Moshi, Tanga, Korogwe, Lindi, Mbeya, Iringa.

The main employment areas are in the Tanga Province, that part of the Eastern Province bounded by the Central Railway, the Arusha and Moshi Districts of the Northern Province, parts of the Southern Highlands Province and the coastal belt of the Lindi and Mikindani Districts in the Southern Province. In addition several large mines in the Lake and Western Provinces and in the Chunya District of the Southern Highlands Province employ large numbers of workers and new centres of employment have grown up in the groundnut scheme areas of the Central, Western and Southern Provinces. The Labour Division is responsible primarily for the care and welfare of African labour in the Territory which is estimated now to number about 375,000.

The Department also maintains thirty labour camps and shelters for the free use of Africans travelling to and from the main employment areas and has established nineteen labour exchanges in the more important employment areas and district headquarters with the object of placing skilled and semi-skilled workers both ex-service men and civilians in touch with potential employers.

The Training Division maintains a technical training centre at Dar es Salaam for 400 trainees which provides short term courses for ex-service and civilian tradesmen to train them for paid employment either in industry or in rural areas. Advanced training for selected trainees in certain trades is also given.

Welfare

The exiguous establishment of the Social Welfare Department has restricted its activities to the supervision of twenty-four centres which have been provided by the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. In addition there are six Welfare Clubs in Native Authority or rented buildings. The chief activities of these centres are as social clubs and focal points for the dissemination of information and adult education. The centres are run by local voluntary effort and their success depends on the availability of suitable leaders.

Communications

Roads

Motor traffic is now possible over 16,000 miles of roads during the dry season.

The Railways Administration operate road services connecting the Central and Tanga Railways and providing regular transport to the Southern and Usumbura Highlands, over a route mileage of 1,174. Traffic handled by these services in 1946 was: passenger miles, 25,156,220; freight ton miles, 3,876,778; vehicle miles, 3,749,179. Total receipts, £150,169.

Steamships

The ports of Lake Victoria are served by the steamers of the Kenya and Uganda Marine; those of Lake Nyasa by the Nyasaland Government steamers; and the Tanganyika Railways steamship "Liema" and a smaller one, "Mwanza," together with a Belgian service, maintain communications on Lake Tanganyika. The British steamer "Liema" (late German s.s. "Goatzen," 794 and 388 tons gross and net respectively) was put into commission in 1927, and maintains a service to Mpulungu, in Northern Rhodesia, via Southern Lake ports.

**Currency and Banking**

The German Government and the Deutch Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft minted and issued silver rupees of the Indian standard and subsidiary coins. The silver coinage was redeemed at the rate of 2s. of East African currency to the rupee, was withdrawn from circulation and ceased to be legal tender as from 1st April, 1923. The period of the redemption of the subsidiary nickel and copper coinage (hellers) expired on 15th August, 1925. It became necessary to redeem Indian silver coinage at the same rate and redemption was effected by 23rd July, 1921.

The only currency now recognised in the Territory is shillings and subsidiary coins and currency notes of the East African Currency Board.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), the Banque du Congo Belge and the Exchange Bank of India and Africa.

**Trade and Customs**

Since 1923 the customs tariff of the Territory has been identical with that in force in Kenya and Uganda and provision was made for the duty-free interchange of all goods grown, produced or manufactured in any one of the three territories. In 1927 the customs management laws of the three territories were co-ordinated, and on 1st August, 1927, effect was given to an agreement under which all goods on which duty had been collected in one of the territories may be transferred to any of the other territories without further formality except the preparation of simple transfer forms, on which inter-territorial adjustments of revenue are subsequently arranged.

The tariff was revised in 1930, being enacted simultaneously in Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda. The basic fiscal rate is 20 per centum, ad valorem, assessed on the landed value of goods at the port of entry, building materials, artisan’s tools and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on a number of items, such as potable spirits, tobacco products and petrol. During 1940-42 there was introduced a system of differential surcharges, varying from 10 per centum upwards, of the customs duties normally payable; these surcharges are still in force. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, insecticides, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, packing materials and many articles necessary for the agricultural, industrial and educational development of the Territory.

Full particulars of the trade of the Territory will be found in the annual trade report.

**Production and Trade**

**Forestry**

Tanganyika has three natural regions—the coast lowlands, the high plateau and the high mountain slopes around Mount Kilimanjaro and other northern peaks and round Rungwe and the Livingstones in the south. In these regions there are high rainfall areas as also in the foothills of the Ulugurus and Usambaras characterised by the presence of tropical rain-forest. The known total area of closed forest other than dry zone forest is in the region of 19,000 square miles or just over 5 per cent. of the land area of the territory. The total forest land is approximately 151,000 square miles or 44 per cent. of the total land area of the territory. Of this approximately 19,000 square miles is closed forest, approximately 131,000 square miles is savannah woodland and 308 square miles is mangroves. These forests contain some good merchantable timbers in varying quantity, among which camphor, podo, mvule and certain African mahoganies are the most important. In addition valuable species of hardwoods occur as single trees or in groups widely scattered throughout the large areas of savannah forest, chief being muninga and African blackwood. The mangrove woods are valuable as a source of tanning bark and also of poles which are carried by Arab dhows to the Persian Gulf. The possible output of the forests of Tanganyika far exceeds the normal local consumption but wartime demands and the restriction of markets has made such heavy calls on the forest estate that a re-assessment of the position is overdue. The approximate production of timber in 1947, including free issues, was 4 million cubic feet, round volume, and of firewood 8 million cubic feet, the total value of all being in the region of £1,547,000.

**Water Development Department**

The Department was organised for the provision of water supplies other than for township supply (which is undertaken by the Public Works Department), flood control, and control of water-power resources within the Territory.

The Construction Section undertakes the construction of earth dams and river-training works, the installation of pumping machinery and filtration plant and the construction of the tanks in association therewith, for domestic supply and cattle-watering.

The Water Boring Section undertakes the location of suitable sites and the drilling of boreholes and the sinking of wells for water-supplies whilst affording technical advice to private concerns on the provision of sub-surface supplies.
