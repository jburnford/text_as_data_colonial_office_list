BRITISH HONDURAS

SITUATION AND AREA

British Honduras is a Colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the Falls of Gracias a Dios on the River Sarstoon, to Garbutt’s Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier, on the south by Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18° 29' and 15° 54' N. latitude and 88° 10' and 89° 09' W. longitude.

The area of the Colony is 8,867 square miles (about the size of Wales), including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George’s, English, Turneffe and other Cays (Islands), 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. It is estimated that about 175 square miles are under cultivation.
CLIMATE

Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 90°, the minimum 62°. The humidity in Belize, a seaport, is relatively high. Sea breezes prevail for the greater part of the year. The average rainfall during the past twenty years has been 81-48 inches per annum. From the middle of February to the middle of May is the dry season. For the rest of the year there is rain to some extent during every month, the heaviest rainfall being in the months of September, October and November, during which months about one-third of the total rain occurs.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached. The characteristic soils of the Colony are known as Cohune ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), the Pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass), and Broken ridge (intermediate between these two). Besides these there are swamp, savannah, mountain, forest and high rain forest soils.

The chief rivers are in the north of the Colony, and run in a north-easterly direction, the Belize reaching the sea on the east, and the Hondo and the New River on the north.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscomb Mountains a height of some 3,700 feet is attained.

POPULATION.

The population of the several districts of the Colony, based on the census taken on 9th April, 1946, was:

| District            | Population |
|---------------------|------------|
| Belize District     | 26,781     |
| Northern District   | 12,293     |
| Stann Creek District| 6,373      |
| Toledo District     | 6,403      |
| Cayo District       | 7,370      |
| **Total**           | **59,220** |

Of the total population 54,756 were, at the date of the 1946 census, British subjects. Of this number, 107 were born in the United Kingdom. There were 155 Americans, of whom 120 were born in the United States. There were 1,592 persons born in Guatemala, 1,589 born in the Republic of Honduras and 725 born in Mexico.

Population of towns at census of 1946: Belize, 21,886; Corozal, 2,190; Orange Walk, 1,395; Stann Creek, 3,414; Punta Gorda, 1,375; El Cayo, 1,548; Benque Viejo, 1,264.

HISTORY

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers, who were attracted by the logwood which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were long at St. George's Cay. The name of the present chief town and of the River Belize is alleged to be a corruption of the name of the buccaneer Wallis, who was driven from Hispaniola in that year, and who is said to have been the leader of the settlers. The Spaniards frequently endeavoured to expel the logcutters; but, though they succeeded in driving them from the northern coast of Yucatan about 1717, they failed to dislodge them from the eastern coast.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito coast, in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers. Their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection, and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain, and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Ruatan, and at Black River on the mainland. Ruatan was abandoned in 1749, but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements on the Mosquito Coast. As a result of the treaty of Paris in 1763, the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay," the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms. By the Treaty of Versailles of 1783 Spain recognised a district (within what is now British Honduras) within which the British logcutters might work without interference; and by the Convention of London signed in 1786, it was agreed that the British Colonists should evacuate the Mosquito Coast and the adjacent islands. In spite of these treaties, many of the settlers remained outside the agreed limits; and it was not until the treaties of 1859 with the Republic of Honduras and 1860 with Nicaragua that the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast were finally recognised as belonging to those states, Nicaragua agreeing to allow the Mosquito Indians autonomy in the Reserve which was assigned to them.

On 10th September, 1931, Belize was visited by a hurricane and tidal wave which caused great damage and loss of life.

CONSTITUTION

The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1765 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790-1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1840 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, and a Legislative Council substituted
therefor, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial members, with the Lieutenant Governor as President. The constitution of the Council was altered in 1892, after a dispute with the Governor, and became three *ex officio* members and not less than five (nominated) unofficial members with the Governor as President. Since 1913 the Council has consisted of six official and seven unofficial members. A new Legislative Council was constituted in 1936 (under Ordinance No. 13 of 1935). By Ordinance No. 21 of 1938, the number of the constituencies was increased from four to five and the number of elected members from five to six. Ordinance No. 13 of 1935 was amended by Ordinance No. 4 of 1945 to provide for a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, not more than three *ex officio*, four unofficial members nominated by the Governor and six unofficial members elected by five constituencies. On 31st October, 1884, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica. These were renewed by Letters Patent proclaimed on 10th September, 1909.

The English Common Law and all statutes of the Imperial Parliament "in abrogation or derogation or in any way declaratory of the Common Law" passed before 1899 extend to the Colony as far as local circumstances render such extension suitable, and subject to modification by Colonial ordinances. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 31 of 1923, a new and revised edition of the Laws of this Colony has been published in two volumes. This edition, referred to as "The Consolidated Laws, 1924," came into force on 4th February, 1925, and supersedes the revised edition published in 1915 and all ordinances passed before July, 1924. Appeals to His Majesty in Council are regulated by Chapter 155 of the Consolidated Laws, 1924.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, and official and unofficial members; three of the official members are *ex officio*, four other members being appointed.

**ADMINISTRATION**

For administrative purposes the Colony is divided into five districts—Belize, which includes the capital at the mouth of the river of the same name; the Northern District; the Cayo district; the Stann Creek district; and the Toledo district, the main station of which is Punta Gorda.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

With three exceptions, the schools, both primary and secondary, are denominational. 78 primary schools are maintained or aided by the Colonial Government. In 1947 the total roll was 10,707, the average attendance 8,317, and the cost $188,668.39.

The total number of pupils on the roll in all the schools was about 13,100, with an average attendance of approximately 10,000.

A law "To provide for Compulsory Education in certain cases," was passed in January, 1915. This law was replaced by Law No. 14 of 1926, by which attendance at school is now compulsory throughout the Colony.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Shipping**

The easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is communication twice monthly with New Orleans, weekly, Puerto Barrios and Puerto Cortes, and monthly (approximately) with Liverpool. The usual length of the journey between England and British Honduras is 16 days, via the United States, and about 21 days via Jamaica.

**Telegraphs and Telephones**

Telegraphic communication with Europe is maintained by a landline to Consejo on the Hondo River, which connects, by a cable across the Hondo, with the Mexican telegraph system through Chetumal, Quintana Roo in Yucatan (1911); and by radio-telegraphic communication with New Orleans (1915) and with the Jamaica station of Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited, whence communication is maintained, via Canada, with Great Britain and beyond by the system of Cable and Wireless Limited.

A telephone line exists between Belize and the southerly town of Monkey River, from Belize to the Cayo, and from Belize to Corozal. A radiotelegraph station is situated in Belize, and others (for inland services only), at Corozal, Monkey River and Punta Gorda.

**Air**

There is a thrice-weekly service between Belize and the U.S.A. There is also a service twice a week between Belize and Mexico by planes of Transportes Aereos Mexicanos (TAM), and twice a week to the Republic of Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama via Merida by planes of Transportes Aereos Mexicanos (TAM).

There is a weekly service to Jamaica by BIAL planes.

**Air Mail**

To U.S.A. (via Havana), Mexico, 15 cents for first \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz. and 10 cents for each additional \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz.; Guatemala and Honduras, and Nicaragua 15 cents for first \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz. and 10 cents for each additional \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz.; Costa Rica and Panama (including Canal Zone), 30 cents for first \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz. and 20 cents for each additional \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz. These rates are in addition to the ordinary postage.

The Trans-Atlantic rate to the U.K. is 20 cents for each \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz. in addition to the ordinary air mail rate.

The Light Weight Air Letter rate to U.K. and the British Empire is 15 cents.

The special rate to West Indies by service of British West Indian Airways, Ltd., is 5 cents for each \( \frac{1}{2} \) oz.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

By Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, the currency was established on a gold basis, the United States gold dollar being adopted as the standard coin. Gold coins of the United States Mint are legal tender for the amounts of their respective denominations in standard dollars; also the British
sovereign and half-sovereign for the amounts of $4·867 and $2·433 respectively. The pound sterling exchanges at the rate of £1 = $4·03. There is a local subsidiary currency of 50 cent, 25 cent, and 10 cent silver pieces, and a Government note issue of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5 and 10 dollars; a nickel bronze 5 cent piece and a bronze cent piece are also current. The silver coins are legal tender up to 10 dollars and the nickel and bronze up to 50 cents. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corozal, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda and the Cayo), had on 31st December, 1946, balances totalling $1,743,450.

On 14th October, 1912, The Bank of British Honduras, Ltd., was bought over as a going concern by the Royal Bank of Canada. Banking business of every character is conducted.
