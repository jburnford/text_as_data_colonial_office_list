NORTHERN RHODESIA

Situation and Area

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambezi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the territory is estimated at about 284,745 square miles.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into six provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Lusaka, to which the principal departmental headquarters were moved from Livingstone in May, 1935. Other important settlements are at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Mazabuka, Ndola, near which the copper mines of Nchanga, Nkana (Kitwe), Roan Antelope (Luanshya) and Mufulira are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu in Barotseland.

Climate

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from May to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° F. to 90° F. with a maximum of 103° F. and a minimum of 56° F. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 55° F. to 75° F. with a maximum of 86° F. and a minimum of 40° F. In some parts the maximum temperature has reached the high figure of 120° F., whilst a minimum of 30° F. or less is not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from over 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 inches or less in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again.

General Description

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography, with elevations varying from 3,000 feet to 5,000 feet above sea level, but in the north-eastern districts the plateau rises to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. In many localities the evenness of the plateau is broken by hills, sometimes occurring as chains which develop into areas of broken country. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains, which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet.

On the whole the territory is well wooded, even the crests of the highest hills bearing trees and orchard-like bush. Hundreds of square miles of country lie under tall grass along the Kafue in an area known as the Kafue Flats, in the Barotse plains near the Zambezi and also a large area south of Lake Bangweulu. These open grassy spaces for the most part contain swamps in which the water level fluctuates with the rainy seasons. The southern and central districts comprise areas where sparse bush alternates with grass lands in which farming and ranching have developed.

A glance at a large scale map suggests that the territory is well watered, but many of the smaller rivers shown have a seasonal flow and dry up after the rains. The larger rivers, the Zambezi, Kafue, Luangwa, the Chambeshi and the Luapula, together with their larger tributaries, have an all-year-round flow. The three great lakes of Northern Rhodesia are Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundaries. Lake Bangweulu and the swamps at its southern end cover an area of about 3,800 square miles, and there are a number of other much smaller lakes such as Lake Young in the Mpika district, Lake Chila near Abercorn, Lake Chirengwa near Ndola and Lusiwasi Lake (or Lake Moir) off the Great North Road to the east of Serenje. Northern Rhodesia has the greatest waterfall in the world, the Victoria Falls, on its southern boundary and the highest waterfall in Africa, Kalambo Falls, 704 feet, on its northern border.

Population

A census was held in October, 1946, of all Europeans, Asiatics and Coloured persons, and also of Africans in employment; this showed the population to be as follows:

| Europeans | |
|-----------|-----|
| Male      | 11,276 |
| Female    | 10,643 |
| Total     | 21,919 |

(This figure includes 3,181 Polish evacuees)

| Asiatics | |
|----------|-----|
| Male     | 835 |
| Female   | 284 |
| Total    | 1,119 |

| Coloured | |
|----------|-----|
| Male     | 427 |
| Female   | 362 |
| Total    | 789 |

| Africans (estimated, as at 31st December, 1946) | |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Total population                                | 1,565,547 |

A more recent estimate of the European population gives a total of 30,000 (including Polish evacuees, the majority of whom have now left the Territory).

HISTORY

The first explorations north of the Zambezi were carried out by various Portuguese travellers at the end of the eighteenth century. The first British person to enter Northern Rhodesia was Dr. Livingstone who reached the Zambezi in 1855. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, 20 years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the north but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interceptioned on its way to the east coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898.

On 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company conferring upon it large powers of administration in Rhodesia to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa. In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

CONSTITUTION

By Orders-in-Council dated 20th February, 1924, the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted, and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council.

The Executive Council is at present composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Administrative Secretary, the Economic Secretary, the Director of Development and four Unofficial Members of whom three are Elected Members of the Legislative Council and one a Nominated Member of the Legislative Council representing African interests. The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, nine Official Members and fourteen Unofficial Members, of whom ten are elected Europeans, two are Europeans nominated to represent African interests and two are Africans.

ADMINISTRATION

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as native authorities and courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District Officers. The Barotse Province is a native...
reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a kuta or native council to assist him.

The law of the territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the territory unless it has been specifically applied.

Administrative officers in their capacities as magistrates of subordinate courts have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from subordinate courts of the 3rd class to provincial commissioners' courts and from subordinate courts (including provincial commissioners' courts) of the 1st and 2nd class to the High Court.

In the large towns, Resident Magistrates, who are professional lawyers, hold courts of the first class.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

European

At the end of 1947 there were 13 Government schools in the territory. Of these, 11 offered primary education up to Standard 5 and secondary education up to Form II. The schools at Silver Rest and Fort Jameson provided instruction only within the primary range (K.G. to Standard 5). The total enrolment at Government schools was 2,713.

Certain controlled schools under private management catered for children below the permissive school age and others offered instruction within the Government school range. In addition, the Broken Hill Convent School offered secondary education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard (Form IV) and the Luanshya Convent School had a Form III, in which general instruction including commercial subjects was given. At other convent schools, instruction in commercial subjects and music was made available to pupils after Form II. The total enrolment at controlled schools under private management was 719.

Boarding accommodation was available at four Government schools and four private schools.

By arrangement with the Southern Rhodesia Education Department correspondence tuition was provided, as required, for children (mainly six to eight years old) living more than three miles from the nearest day school.

Coloured and Asiatic

Katapolo School, under Government management, offered education for Coloured children in the primary range. There were three private government-aided Indian schools.

African

The Department of African Education supervises the educational work of the mission societies which, assisted through a grant-in-aid system, are responsible for the management of the majority of schools in the territory. There is an advisory board on African Education with Mission, African and Government representatives.

In 1947 there were 1,226 schools receiving grant-in-aid, including 28 native authority schools. Tuition is free, fees are paid at boarding schools.

Primary education is divided into three grades: Elementary (Sub-Std. A to Std. II); Lower Middle (Stds. III and IV); Upper Middle (Stds. V and VI). The teaching of English normally begins in Sub-Std. B. Teachers for the elementary and lower middle schools are trained at two Government and 19 mission centres of which five are specifically for girls. The total enrolment in all types of assisted and Government schools is 139,000, of whom 43,000 are girls. Compulsory education for the age group 12–16 years, has been introduced into three districts on the Copperbelt and at Broken Hill and Livingstone. As staff and buildings become available it will be introduced at other urban centres.

There are 33 Government schools. The Jeanes School, Chalimbana, trains school supervisors and teachers for the primary schools and also provides an annual course for Chiefs. The Munali Training Centre, Lusaka, includes a trade school and a secondary school with classes going up to the Cambridge School Certificate standard. Africans who desire higher education go either to Makerere College, Uganda, to the South African College, Fort Hare or to the United Kingdom. Government gives bursaries to those who qualify and are selected for higher education.

The estimated expenditure on African education for 1948 is £234,410 of which £145,169 is grants-in-aid for recurrent expenditure.

Information Services

The Information Department was established in 1946. The media used are the press, the cinema and broadcasting. The duties of the Department are:

(a) To disseminate information concerning the Territory outside its own borders and particularly in the United Kingdom, to provide accurate information concerning policy and affairs of the Territory for use in foreign countries, so as to counter any misrepresentation of British Colonial policy and activities.

(b) To keep all sections of the public of Northern Rhodesia informed of the policy and activities of its Government.

(c) To keep the population of the Territory informed of His Majesty's Government's Colonial policy, and to assist in the presentation of the British way of life and major developments in the United Kingdom to the people of Northern Rhodesia.

(d) To assist in development campaigns and mass adult education of Africans, and in mass literacy.

(e) To foster the development and expansion of the tourist industry.

The Department maintains a close liaison with the Central African Council, and its Director is a member of the Standing Committee on Public Relations of the Central African Council.

The Department issues about 400 press communiques and handouts a year on the activities of other departments and drawing the attention of the public to instructions, regulations or ordinances which affect them. Daily communiques on the proceedings of the Legislative Council, the African Representative Council and the African Provincial Councils are also issued while they are in session. Full publicity is given to the two last named bodies in "Mutende", a vernacular newspaper published by the Department, which has a circulation of over 14,000
fortnightly. As soon as the necessary printing presses have been installed "Mutende" will be issued as a weekly newspaper.

The Press communiqués are supplemented by photographs of current events of importance and general interest, for use in local and overseas newspapers. There is a small photographic staff and new darkroom facilities are being constructed. The demand for photographs, both in Britain and in North America is so great that the photographic section is working continually at full pressure.

Mobile cinemas bring education and entertainment to African villagers. Four mobile cinemas in lorries cover the greater part of the Provinces and one river unit on the Zambezi and another on Lake Bangweulu reach areas that are inaccessible by road. Films are drawn from a film library, part of the Information Department, which has a stock of over 700 16-millimetre films. Fixed point cinemas and private exhibitors also make use of the film library. The organisation of the sittings of the Native Film Censorship Board, which occur two or three times a week, is also a responsibility of the Department.

The Information Department has its own small film production section, producing films mainly for Africans. It also has a share in the Central African Film Unit. One of the two mobile production units of this organisation is based on the Information Department at Lusaka.

Under an agreement between the Governments of Northern and Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Department's broadcasting station at Lusaka transmits programmes to the African population of the three territories; the European programmes will be transmitted by Southern Rhodesia from Salisbury. Programmes are on the air daily from 5.0 p.m. to 7.0 p.m. in English, Chibemba, Chinyanja, Silozi, Chitonga, Sishona and Sindebele, on the 31, 41 and 76 metre bands. Sunday morning programmes at present are directed to Europeans. The programmes include world and local news, talks, plays and music. The possibility of providing cheap listening facilities to Africans is being investigated. British-made battery sets at a price of about £6 5s. 0d. have already been received from a manufacturer in the United Kingdom, whose representative has visited Central, West and South Africa and the Congo to gain first-hand information on the listening requirements of Africans. The Department has 150 community receivers placed in welfare centres, schools, missions and District Headquarters through the Territory.

Staff and building shortages, and the non-delivery of equipment, have prevented the full development of the transmission side of broadcasting. A fully qualified engineer, with a small staff of technicians, operates the 2½ kw. transmitter, and it is hoped that in 1949 a 15 kw. transmitter will be installed. A number of recordings of African plays and music have been made and are being distributed commercially through a firm in South Africa. With the arrival of mobile recording equipment it is hoped to expand this side of broadcasting activities considerably and to provide new and outstanding material for programmes. Plans are in hand for improvements in studio, control and reception facilities, and research is being carried out on aerial and allied technical subjects, as well as possible site improvements.

The Department is responsible for the development of the tourist industry. It is at present concerned with the opening up of several new areas for tourists, and with the production of tourist publicity material.

Health

In Northern Rhodesia, generally speaking, conditions are not unduly hard on white residents and outside the low lying river valleys the climate is mainly very pleasant. There are extensive plateaux 3,000-4,500 feet above sea level and with reasonable precautions there is little to fear from the point of view of health. Susceptible individuals should take precautions against sunburn and protect their eyes from glare by the use of dark glasses.

Modern methods of prophylaxis combined with routine anti-malarial measures in the towns have considerably reduced the risks of contracting malaria.

Investigations have shown that endemic yellow fever is present in the Barotse Province and Balovale District of the Territory. Persons travelling to these areas should therefore be in possession of a valid certificate of inoculation against yellow fever. The certificate is not valid until 10 days after the date of inoculation and remains valid until four years from the date of inoculation.

Human Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) is endemic in certain districts remote from the settled areas. Relapsing fever (transmitted by ticks) is common among natives but there is little danger of its being contracted by Europeans if reasonable precautions are taken.

The Government Medical and Health Services are under the control and direction of Director of Medical Services whose administrative headquarters is at Lusaka. The Territory is divided into six provinces in each of which public health work is under the supervision of the Provincial Medical Officer. In the mine townships the duties of Medical Officer of Health are performed by members of the medical staff of the mining companies. Elsewhere the Provincial Medical Officer or a Government Medical Officer is the Medical Officer of Health and is in charge of general public health and anti-malarial work.

The principal towns have protected purified piped water supplies for the whole or part of the township. Smaller towns have wells or bore-hole supplies.

The total actual Health Department expenditure for 1947 was £275,459 and the total estimated Health Department expenditure for 1948 is £339,962.

Hospitals.—The following hospitals are provided in the Territory:

| Hospitals          | Beds |
|--------------------|------|
| European Hospitals |      |
| 8 Government       | 310  |
| 4 Mining company   | 196  |
| African Hospitals  |      |
| 13 Government      | 1,295|
| 9 Mission hospitals| 227  |
| 4 Mining company   | 727  |

There is a training school at Lusaka for African medical personnel both male and female. In addition the mining companies and missions train male and female African medical personnel in their hospitals.

Silicosis.—The Silicosis Medical Bureau has been established at Kitwe in the Copperbelt.
Dental Services.—With the appointment of a Government Dental Surgeon it has been possible to provide dental inspection and treatment for the European school children in the Territory.

The major items in the programme for development of medical and health services are consolidation and improvement of existing services, including the modernisation of various hospitals in the territory; the development of the rural dispensaries system, the extension of the medical education of Africans and, in particular, the education of African girls as nurses and midwives; the establishment of a school for African sanitary inspectors, the institution of schemes for specific purposes such as the prevention and treatment of leprosy, tuberculosis and sleeping sickness; and general improvements of social and hygienic conditions in both rural and suburban areas.

Labour

The estimated number of persons in employment in heavy industries in the Territory in 1948 was 6,000 Europeans and 62,000 Africans. A further 1,500 Europeans and 80,000 Africans (estimated) were engaged in other forms of employment in the Territory.

In the principal industry in the country—copper mining—average monthly wages for Europeans were £55 surface, and £63 underground, and for Africans 51s. 6d. surface, and 61s. 6d. underground. Real earnings for both races were considerably more, in view of the bonuses, cheap housing, cost of living allowances enjoyed by Europeans and free housing and food provided for Africans.

Wage rates in other industries and occupations continued to rise during the year, but so did the cost of living. The index stood at 146 at the end of the year (1939 = 100.)

There were no prolonged strikes amongst workers during the year. There was a 48-hour sectional strike of European miners at one mine over a wage dispute and a 4-day stoppage of work at the Broken Hill lead and vanadium mine of African workers. There were also several short stoppages of work amongst Africans in other industries which officers of the Labour Department were able to settle by mediation. The commonest cause of these strikes was conditions of work rather than wage rates, though wage demands, which were sometimes successful, were often a contributory cause.

The most notable feature of the year was the growth of trade unionism amongst Africans. African mineworkers at two mines had formed unions by the end of the year and shop assistants and motor drivers on the Copperbelt had also formed their separate unions. The shop assistants negotiated an agreement on wages and conditions of service with representatives of commerce, which was the first of its kind in the history of the territory.

The staff of the Labour Department was increased to 12 officers in the field and one new station was opened.

The Workmen's Compensation Ordinance applies in cases of disablement due to injuries by accidents arising out of and in the course of employment, including certain scheduled occupational diseases and other diseases when the contracting of them may be classed as accidents. For the purposes of the ordinance a workman is, with certain exceptions, an employee whose earnings do not exceed £950 per annum. Silicosis is not included as an occupational disease, but is specially provided for by the Silicosis (Temporary Arrangements) Ordinance.

Both ordinances provide for compensation to all races of workmen, and a notable feature of each is the control exercised; in workmen's compensation this is by a commissioner, and in the case of silicosis by a Compensation Board. The ordinances have continued to operate with the minimum of disagreement and with no litigation.

Welfare

European welfare matters are catered for by branches of the Women's Institute of Northern Rhodesia and by patriotic and charitable bodies.

A Central Charities Committee exists and a Territorial Council for Child Welfare is in process of formation. In urban areas most local authorities and large employers of labour employ both European and African welfare officers, whose duties include the organisation of football and other sports, handicrafts of all kinds, libraries, cinematograph shows, etc.

COMMUNICATIONS

Railways

The railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambezi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have now been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nchanga via Nkana, a distance of 84 miles. Another line runs from Mokambo, in the Belgian Congo, to Mufulira, nine miles distant.

Roads

Road communications have been improved and further improvements are being undertaken. The arterial road system has been provided with a large number of permanent bridges and culverts and a programme to complete this work is in hand. The main arterial roads are—

(i) The Great North Road from the Otto Beit Bridge over the Zambezi River at Chirundu on the Southern Rhodesia border via Kafue, where the road joins the railway line, Lusaka, Broken Hill and Kapiri Mposhi, where the road leaves the railway line to Mpika, Isoka, and Tunduma where the road joins the Tanganyika and Nyasaland road systems. The length of the Great North Road is 750 miles. From Mpika there is a road to Abercorn and Mpulungu Harbour on Lake Tanganyika via Kasama, a distance of 270 miles and from Abercorn there is a connection to Tunduma, a distance of 114 miles. The section of the Great North Road between Chirundo and Broken Hill is to be provided with a bituminous surface and work was started between Lusaka and Kafue in 1948.
(ii) The Livingstone Road from Livingstone follows the railway line northwards until it meets the Great North Road at Kafue River, a distance of 276 miles.

(iii) The Great East Road runs from Lusaka eastwards to Fort Jameson and the Nyasaland border, a distance of 400 miles. This road crosses the Luangwa River at 157 miles from Lusaka by an imposing bridge presented to the territory by the Beit Trust.

(iv) The Congo Border road which branches from the Great North Road 3 miles north of Kapiri Mposhi proceeds north to the Copper mining area and from there on to Solwezi and Mwinilunga, a distance of 498 miles. The Kafue River near Nkana is crossed by another large bridge presented by the Beit Trust. From Solwezi there is a road southwards to Kasempa and Mumbwa then running eastwards to join the Great North Road 45 miles north of Lusaka.

From Kasempa a road 229 miles in length runs westwards to Balovale.

A new road 122 miles in length from Mufulira across the pedicle of the Congo to Fort Rosebery and the Northern Province was opened in 1947. A main road 220 miles in length connects Fort Rosebery with Kasama.

In the copper mining area, Ndola-Luanshya and Nkana are connected by bituminous surfaced roads and it is expected that Nkana-Nchanga and Mufulira will be connected with similar surfaces within a short time; the Nkana-Mufulira road will be completed shortly. The road from Livingstone to the Victoria Falls has a bituminous surface also.

In addition to the above main roads there is a large mileage of secondary roads serving the settled areas and districts.

Rivers

The Zambezi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambezi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their courses, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aviation

The corridor route through the territory follows the track joining the four main control airfields of Kasama, Ndola, Lusaka Livingstone, where immigration, custom and sanitary control facilities are established, and where aeradio communication facilities are installed and operated. Ten secondary airfields are connected with these main airfields by internal scheduled services operated by Central African Airways Corporation.

Routes are as follows:

(a) Internal

(i) Lusaka – Ndola – Kasama – Abercorn, including Mpika on request.

(ii) Lusaka–Fort Jameson.

(iii) Lusaka – Mumbwa – Mankoya – Mongu-Kalabo-Balovale.

(iv) Lusaka – Livingstone – Mongu – Kalabo-Balovale.

(b) External

(i) Salisbury – Lusaka – Ndola – Mbeya-Tabora – Nairobi.

(c) Two aircraft charter companies are licensed in Northern Rhodesia: Messrs. Thatcher Hobson Airways, Ltd., and Messrs. Zambesi Airways, Ltd., who provide charter facilities for passengers and freight at fares varying between 1s. 3d. and 1s. 6d. per mile, to any of the 38 airfields or landing grounds established in the territory.

Detailed information concerning civil aviation in Northern Rhodesia will be incorporated in the 1948 edition of the Northern Rhodesia Air Pilot, obtainable from the Director of Civil Aviation or the Government Printer, Northern Rhodesia.

Posts, Telegraphs and Wireless

There is a daily mail service by rail between post offices on the line of rail. Offices off the line of rail receive and despatch mails at least once a week. First class mail matter for Fort Jameson and places in the Northern Province and certain offices in Barotseland is conveyed by air. Other cross posts are by motor vehicle or carriers. Mails to and from adjoining countries are despatched by all passenger trains, and Central African Airways convey surcharged airmail despatches at frequent intervals. Airmails for overseas countries are forwarded by South African Airways (Springbok Service) three times a week, connection with the main service being made at Nairobi by Central African Airways feeder services. Seaborne mails are forwarded via Capetown once a week.

There are 54 post offices, 14 of which are money order offices and 26 are telegraph offices. The main telegraph and telephone route lies alongside the railway line from the Victoria Falls to the Belgian Congo border with branches from Ndola to Luanshya and Ndola to Kitwe, Chingola and Mufulira.

Wireless stations at Abercorn, Balovale, Fort Jameson, Kasama, Kasempa, Livingstone, Mwinilunga, Mpika, Mongu, Ndola, and Ridge-way (Lusaka) maintain a public service.

Revenue

The main sources of revenue are:

(i) Taxation.
(ii) Customs duties.

(i) An income tax was first imposed in Northern Rhodesia in 1921. The rates of tax now in force are:

Individuals:
The following deductions are allowed from the total income in arriving at the chargeable income:

(a) Personal deduction:
For unmarried persons £250.
For married persons £500.

(b) Deduction for children:
For each child £120.

(c) Deduction for dependants:
The amount expended, limited to the amount by which the income of the dependant falls short of £250. Where there are two or more persons jointly maintaining the dependant the deduction is apportioned between them.

(d) Life, Accident and Sickness Insurance:
The annual premium paid, not exceeding one-sixth of the total income less £250, with a maximum deduction of £120.

(e) Widowers, or others similarly situated who have custody of and who support their children, receive the allowances and are taxed at the rates applicable to married persons.

Rates of Tax

Married persons:
For every £1 of the first £250 of chargeable income, 1s. 6d. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 1s. 6d. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 2s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 3s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 4s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 5s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £500, 6s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £500, 7s. in £.
For every £1 in excess of £2,500, 7s. 6d. in £.

Unmarried persons:
For every £1 of the first £500 of chargeable income, 2s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 3s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 4s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 5s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 6s. in £.
For every £1 of the next £250, 7s. in £.
For every £1 in excess of £1,750, 7s. 6d. in £.

Companies:
The company rate of tax is 7s. 6d. in £.

(ii) Customs Revenue has been increasing steadily and is expected to exceed £1,000,000 in 1949.

The Customs Tariff of Northern Rhodesia, which has remained substantially unchanged since 1938, provides for two rates of duty, (i) general rates and (ii) Empire preferential and Congo Basin rates. This position arises from the fact that approximately one-third of Northern Rhodesia (the North-Eastern portion) lies within the conventional boundaries of the Congo Basin, and, being subject to the Congo Basin Treaties under which the granting of preferential treatment to goods from any particular country is prohibited, goods of both Empire and foreign origin are admitted to this area at the lower or preferential rates. The Congo Basin area falls outside the scope of the Customs agreements between Northern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa or Southern Rhodesia.

The Northern Rhodesia tariff provides for specific rates of duty on practically all foodstuffs and on beer, potable spirits, tobacco, cement, coal and coke, candles, lubricating oils, paraffin, tyres and tubes, matches and blasting compounds. Other articles are subject to ad valorem duties on an f.o.b. value basis or are admitted duty free.

The Customs agreements concluded with the Union of South Africa (1930) and Southern Rhodesia (1933) have, in the main, remained unchanged. They provide for inter-Government transfers of Customs duties in respect of goods imported into one territory and subsequently removed to the other. Goods of local production or manufacture, with the exception of certain articles which are subject to customs duty at specially rebated rates, are interchanged without restriction and inter-Government payments on an ad valorem basis are made.

The Sinking Fund annual payments have been increased to redeem the loans in full in 1970 and 1965 respectively.
3 per cent. Northern Rhodesia Government War Bonds £204,740

These Bonds were issued in units of £5 or multiples of £1 at 3 per cent. redeemable 10 years from date of purchase at £101 per cent., but may be cashed at par plus accrued interest on giving six months' notice. Interest is payable half-yearly.

War Savings Certificates £184,722

These certificates were issued at the price of 15s. having a face value of £1 0s. 6d. after ten years. Certificates may be surrendered and payments obtained with accrued interest at any time prior to the expiration of the period of currency.

The sale of War Savings Certificates was discontinued on the 31st of March, 1947, and of War Bonds on the 11th of October, 1946.

BANKING AND CURRENCY

There are branches of the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., at Livingstone, Lusaka, Broken Hill, Ndola, Kitwe, Luanshya, Mufulira and Mazabuka, an agency at Chingola, and branches of Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) at Lusaka, Livingstone, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Ndola, Kitwe, Luanshya and Mufulira, and an agency at Chingola.

The currency of Northern Rhodesia is that of Southern Rhodesia. United Kingdom coin is also legal tender, but is being withdrawn. South African currency is not legal tender.

TRADE AND INDUSTRY

Agriculture

The total cattle population in 1947 was 770,012. There has been an annual increase of 3·6 per cent. over the past five years.

1,150 head of breeding stock were purchased from Southern Rhodesia as a drought relief measure to that territory and distributed to African and European cattle owners to stimulate future production.

No major outbreaks of disease or climatic disasters have occurred to cause heavy mortality during recent years.

Stock ranching is confined to areas free from trypanosomiasis whose control in marginal areas is increasing in efficiency.

A further year's export to the Livingstone abattoir of cattle from Barotseland, the former endemic pleuro-pneumonia area, confirmed the previous opinion that the territory is now free of this disease. The cattle cordon which has operated on the border between the Southern Province and Barotseland since 1916 has been disbanded.

Consumption of livestock and livestock products continues to outpace the increasing local production, and in these circumstances livestock producers have been able to dispose of all produce to advantage. Subsidy payments on approved breeding stock and on increased butterfat production have continued as a stimulus to production by European livestock farmers.

There has been some change in the attitude of the African stockowner towards disease prevention, and a more ready acceptance of the free inoculation offered against the more common endemic diseases, principally quarter evil and anthrax, and of dipping of cattle and instruction in animal husbandry methods.

The greater portion of the territory is undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little general trade in food commodities except in the railway belt where the surplus native maize crop is marketed by the Maize Control Board. The staple native cereals are finger millet (*Eleusine coracana*), Kaffir-corn (*Sorghum*), and maize. The former is produced over extensive tracts of the territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby grain crops are grown in rotation with forest re-growths. Other native crops are bulrush millet (*Pennisetum typhoideum*), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes and a variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption and a small localised trade only. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the territory, but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Malozi, Baila, Batoka, and, to a less extent, the Angoni in north-eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the territory are impassable to animal transport owing to the presence of tsetse fly.

In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

Maize is the chief crop of the settler. In the season 1945/46 total maize production for sale was 451,000 bags, of which 449,000 were received from the railway line and 11,000 bags were sent in from distant areas. Wheat is grown under irrigation and is at present exported to Bulawayo for milling. Some 27,000 bags were grown in 1946.

The Southern part of the Territory which includes the main farming belt suffered in 1947 one of the worst droughts on record. In the season 1946-47, total maize production for sale fell to 264,000 bags of which 244,000 were received from the railway line and 20,000 bags were sent in from distant areas.

Wheat production fell to less than 5,000 bags.

Flue cured Virginia tobacco is produced chiefly in the Eastern Province.

Tobacco production in 1947 was 3,428,662 lb. of flue cured Virginia and approximately 1,000,000 lb. of Turkish leaf.

Turkish tobacco production is a recent development. It is grown mainly in the railway belt.

The headquarters of the Agricultural Department and the Veterinary Department are at Mazabuka.

Forestry

More than one half of the area of the Protectorate is covered by tree growth, mostly in the form of open woodland. Apart from a minute fraction of evergreen fringing forest along river banks, it is estimated that only 7 per cent. (21,000 square miles) of the woodland is capable of yielding saw timber, with yields that range between 50 and 500 cubic feet per acre.

The amount of privately owned forest is negligible in total area, but rights of mining and private use cover some of the best and most strategically placed forests on the Copper-belt. The Forests Ordinance, 1941, and subsidiary regulations provide for the control and protection of forest growth on Crown Lands, and grant considerable latitude in the free use of forest produce to local inhabitants. In Native Reserves more restricted powers of control are contained
in certain sections of the Native Reserves Regulations. The Barotse Native Government and a few other smaller Native Authorities have adopted orders that provide additional local protection.

1,638 square miles have been declared as Forest Reserves and Protected Forest Areas.

The *Baikiaea plurijuga* (Rhodesian "Teak") forests support at Livingstone the largest saw-milling industry in South Central Africa; the present rate of cutting in Northern Rhodesia (24 million cubic feet of logs per annum, most of which are converted to railway sleepers) is resulting in exhaustion of the forests. The mining companies cut in 1947 a further 957,000 cubic feet of local timber (mainly *Brachystegia* and *Isoberlinia* species), and another 200,000 cubic feet was cut in the territory for minor industries. Other recorded consumption in 1947 included 205,000 poles and 154,000 cords of firewood. Very considerable quantities of firewood, poles and timber are used by the rural African population for domestic purposes, but it is impossible to estimate this consumption; in general this demand is so dispersed that only in a few localities does it represent a marked drain on the forests. Much more destructive are the shifting cultivation systems of agriculture that are traditional over most of the territory, and for which it is often difficult to find sounder and more stable alternatives.

A scarcity of trees exists in some of the flood-plain regions of Bangweulu, the upper Zambesi and the middle Kafue; tree-planting trials have been started in the Bangweulu swamp with a view to reducing the scarcity of wood that is a limiting factor in improving the living conditions of the inhabitants. As there are no coniferous forests in Northern Rhodesia and softwoods have to be imported for many industrial purposes, a programme of planting sub-tropical species of pines is being started on the Copperbelt, where initial trials with these trees have given promising results.

A Forestry Branch had existed as part of the Department of Agriculture since 1929, but was given separate departmental status at the beginning of 1947. It commenced its career with a regular staff of 4 professional and 5 technical European Officers and 108 Africans and a variable force of casual labour.

**Land Settlement**

An Agriculture Survey Commission reported in 1932 upon the alienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European Settlement and this Commission advised as to the class of farming for which the land is suitable. A Land Tenure Committee has since recommended the abolition of freehold title and Crown Land is now normally granted on 30, 99 or 999 years' lease though in special circumstances leases for shorter terms are approved. A Select Committee of Legislative Council has reported upon Land Settlement questions and a Land Board has been set up, with headquarters in Lusaka, to administer various loan schemes.

Crown Land and privately owned land suitable for mixed farming, ranching, and tobacco planting is available within easy distance of the railway, and the price ranges between 3s. 6d. and 80s. an acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from the railway, nature of title, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £3,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a leasehold farm from Government. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia, should be addressed to the Commissioner for Lands, Livingstone.

**Minerals**

The Department of Mines administers the Mining Law, the Mining and Explosives Regulations, the Mining (Silicosis Prevention) Regulations, the Winding Engine Driver's (Certificate of Competency) Regulations, and the Factories Ordinance and Factories (Safety) Regulations. The Registration of Mining Titles is carried out by the Registrar of Titles in the Lands and Surveys Department.

The copper produced in the territory in 1947 totalled 192,772 tons, valued at £20,399,440 as against 182,829 tons valued at £12,347,371 in 1946. The production of the various copper mines in 1947 was:—Mufulira, 53,155 tons of blister copper; Nchanga, 23,016 tons of blister copper and 272 tons of copper concentrates which were sold as concentrates; Nkana, 6,350 tons of blister copper; 56,276 tons of electrolytic copper and 20 tons of copper other; Roan Antelope, 53,703 tons of blister copper. As a by-product Nkana also produced 20,356 cwts of cobalt alloy and 547 ozs. of gold, 73,277 ozs. of silver and 11,826 lbs. of selenium, which were recovered from refinery slimes. At Nkana the sinking of a new main shaft to serve the South Ore body was commenced.

Lead, zinc and vanadium are produced at Broken Hill by underground methods and open-cast mining has ceased. During 1947 extensions of the surface plant were undertaken.

Some of the lead produced is fabricated at the mine into pipes and sheets for use in the metallurgical plant. Iron ore and manganese ore are mined and used as reagents in the production of lead and zinc. The value of the major products from Broken Hill during 1947 is lead, £1,296,755; zinc, £1,301,496; and vanadium, £66,334.

Other mineral activities are on a small scale.

The mineral production for the years 1946 and 1947 was:

| Mineral          | 1946 | 1947 |

| Mica (waste)     | 680  | —    |
| Silica rock      | 694  | —    |

The minerals produced during 1946 were valued at £14,503,196, and those produced during 1947 were valued at £23,521,483.

**Customs Duties**

The tariff, excluding the Congo Basin tariff, provides for Empire preference for the following classes of goods which are mainly liable to ad valorem rates of duty; clothing, blankets and
rugs, cotton piece goods, motor cars, and all articles usually imported for household and native use, the duty on Empire products being in almost every instance 10 per cent. and the duty on foreign varying from 15 to 30 per cent.; in the case of cotton and silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, and rubber shoes, from foreign countries, the tariff provides for additional or alternative specific rates if the duty should be greater at such rates. Agricultural, electrical, mining and other industrial machinery, pipes and piping, metals and metal manufactures imported for industrial purposes, if of Empire manufacture are free of duty and if foreign are subject to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., except foreign electrical machinery which is 10 per cent.

Specific rates of duty apply to practically all imported foodstuffs, lubricating oils, paraffin and cement, and to spirits, wines, beer and tobacco; upon the latter items, apart from rum, bitters, beer and cigars, no preference is granted except under the terms of the customs agreements with the neighbouring territories in the south, but varying rates of preference are granted, under the tariff, to foodstuffs of British origin.
