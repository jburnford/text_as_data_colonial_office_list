KENYA

SITUATION AND AREA

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate", previously known as the East African Protectorate, extends from approximately latitude 4° N. to latitude 4° S. and from longitude 34° E. to 41° E. It is bounded on the North by the Sudan and Abyssinia, on the East by the Indian Ocean and Somalia, on the South by Tanganyika and on the West by Uganda.

Kenya includes parts of two of the great African lakes, Victoria Nyanza and Lake Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,770 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 225,000 square miles. This total area is made up of the following:

| Description                                      | Square Miles |

CLIMATE

The climate of Kenya varies greatly, and may best be described by division into three general climatic zones: (1) the coast and its immediate hinterland; (2) the low plain between 300 feet and 2,000 feet from the Somalia and Abyssinian borders to the north and east of the highlands, comprising two-thirds of the area of the Colony, and (3) the highlands.

The coast has an average temperature of 80° F., and an annual rainfall of between 40 inches and 50 inches over half of which falls in the rainy season of April to June. Zone (2) is mainly a very dry area, with an average annual rainfall of between 5 inches and 20 inches most of which falls in April to May or October to December, and with hot days and cool nights.

The highlands vary in altitude from 3,000 feet to 10,000 feet, with higher mountains such as Kenya (17,041 feet) and Elgon (14,178 feet), and enjoy a climate which is considered generally healthy for Europeans. The average temperature varies 3° F. per 1,000 feet in altitude from about 70° F. at 4,000 feet to 52° F. at 10,000 feet; at Nairobi the mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 78° F. and 57° F. respectively. Frosts may occur over 7,000 feet. The annual rainfall is mainly between 40 inches and 60 inches, but according to altitude and other factors may vary between about 30 inches and nearly 160 inches. The rainy seasons are March to May and October to December east of the Aberdare Mountains and March to September elsewhere, but near Lake Victoria there is no pronounced dry season.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Northern part of Kenya, comprising about three-fifths of the whole, is arid and semi-desert. The Southern part, in which almost all economic production is at present centred, comprises a low-lying coastal strip and a plateau of a mean elevation of about 5,000 feet above sea-level. This area includes the great volcanic mountains of Mount Kenya (17,040 feet), Mount Elgon (14,000 feet) the Aberdare Range (about 12,000 to 13,000 feet) and part of the Great Rift Valley which is 30 to 40 miles wide and forms a continuous depression in places 2,000 to 3,000 feet below the level of the country bounding it on either side.*

The capital of Kenya and the seat of Government is Nairobi which is situated on the edge of the Athi Plains at an elevation of about 5,400 feet above sea-level: it is roughly half way by railway between the seaport of Mombasa and the Uganda border.

The capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is administered by a municipal council. Its population, based so far as non-natives are concerned on preliminary estimates from the census held on the 25th February, 1948, is—Europeans, 10,400; Asians and others, 43,600; with an estimated 75,000 Africans, giving a total of 129,000.

Mombasa is the principal port, administered by a municipal board, and has a population totalling 98,400, which includes 2,200 Europeans, 25,500 Indians, 13,400 Arabs and 56,500 Africans. The figures for the non-native population are again preliminary estimates from the Census held in February 1948, while the Native figures await verification from the African Census. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours. Mombasa harbour is on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a light house and signal station at the entrance to the port.

Other towns having municipal status are Nakuru in the centre of the European farming district, Kisumu situated on Lake Victoria, and Eldoret.

POPULATION

The total population was estimated at 25th February, 1948, as follows:

- Europeans: 29,500
- Indians: 90,900
- Goans: 7,100
- Arabs: 23,900
- Other non-natives: 2,900

Total non-natives: 154,300
Africans: 4,055,000

Total: 4,209,300

Note.—These figures are, for other than Africans, preliminary estimates from the census held on 25th February, 1948. The African figure is estimated as results of the census held on 23rd August, 1948, are not yet available.
On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Kipsigis, the Suk, the Turkana, the Masai, the Somali and the Galla.

RELIGION

Indigenous religious beliefs were animistic; Mohammedanism had established itself on the coast before the coming of British rule, and has more recently established itself in Nairobi and other towns up-country. Mohammedanism also prevails among certain of the tribes of the Northern Frontier Province. A number of Christian missionary societies have been at work in the Colony and Protectorate, and indigenous Christian churches in full communion with the historic churches have been established; it is estimated that the total African Christian community is of the order of 300,000. There are three Roman Catholic missionary organisations in the Colony: the Mill Hill, Consolata, and Holy Ghost Missions. The principal non-Roman organisation are the Africa Inland Mission, the Church Missionary Society, the Methodist Missionary Society, the Church of Scotland Mission, the Society of Friends’ Africa Mission, the Bible Churchmen’s Missionary Society, the Salvation Army, and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission. In addition to their purely pastoral activities, these church organisations are responsible for large educational systems which range from schools providing, without Government grant, an elementary vernacular education. In association with local and central government, and with varying degrees of grant-in-aid, there is a system of primary education, secondary education, and senior secondary education, successful scholars from the last-named passing on to Makerere College, Uganda. Missions are also responsible for a large share in African teacher training, both for men and women teachers. Missions also conduct hospitals, maternity centres, welfare institutions, and dispensaries, some of which are in receipt of small government grants.

There are organised European congregations, this work being done for the most part by the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. The Roman Catholic Church ministers to the Goan community, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the non-Roman Churches have a small work among Indians, who otherwise provide for themselves their own mosques and temples.

There is a small immigrant Jewish community which has its headquarters in Nairobi, where a synagogue has been built.

HISTORY

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891), but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which a rent of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty’s Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-chief. It was transferred, in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted executive and legislative councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the “Kenya Annexation Order-in-Council, 1920,” the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a colony. This Order in Council came into operation on 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan’s mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

CONSTITUTION

Under the Royal Instructions dated 29th March, 1934, amended on 27th April, 1948; the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Chief Secretary and Member for Development, Attorney General and Member for Law and Order, Financial Secretary and Member for Finance, Chief Native Commissioner and Member for Native Affairs, Member for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Deputy Chief Secretary and Member for Education, Member for Health and Local Government (ex officio members), and such other persons as the Governor may appoint, whether holding public office or not, who shall be styled Appointed Members, or appointed as temporary members with the Governor as President. There are four such appointed members. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the colony shall consist of the Governor as President, a Vice-President and Speaker, the 7 ex-officio members of Executive Council, 9 nominated official members, 1 Arab elected member, 11 elected European members, not more than 5 Indian elected members, such persons as the Governor may appoint as nominated unofficial members to represent the African community (at present, they are 4 in number), and one nominated unofficial member to represent the Arab community, thus giving Council its first unofficial majority.

By the “Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920,” it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

The 1924 ordinance governing the election of European, Indian and Arab members to the Legislative Council was consolidated and amended in 1935, but not brought into operation until 1937, when new registers of voters were compiled for the
general elections which took place in 1938. Under amendments to the 1924 ordinance the boundaries of several of the 11 European electoral areas had been altered, and certain areas renamed. These were continued in the 1935 ordinance, which, however, provided for three Indian electoral areas (two each to return two members and the other one) in place of the whole country forming one constituency returning five members. Temporary legislation was introduced during 1948 for the reservation of two of these seats for Moslems. For Arabs, the whole country is still one constituency. The Indian and Arab franchise, like the European, is adult (over 21 years) suffrage, except that in the latter case it is made subject to the ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. The next general election will be in 1952.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on Local Native Councils in the Colony. This Ordinance was replaced in 1937 by a new Ordinance with the same title. Those sections of the latter dealing with local native councils will shortly be superseded by an African District Councils Ordinance, which will confer on African local government bodies similar powers and procedures to those exercised by non-African local authorities. There are now twenty-six Local Native Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works, and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local legislation regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, and other subjects. Local Government Ordinances passed in 1928 in replacement of earlier legislation provide for local government in municipalities and the Settled Areas.

**Administration**

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into five provinces and one extra-provincial district viz.:—

- **The Nyanza Province** (comprises the districts of North Nyanza, South Nyanza, Central Nyanza, Kericho and Kisumu-Londiani).
- **The Rift Valley Province** (comprises the districts of Nakuru, Baringo, Laikipia, Samburu, Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo-Marakwet, Trans Nzoja and West Suk).
- **The Central Province** (comprises the districts of Nairobi, Kiambu, Thika, Fort Hall, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Embu, Meru, Machakos and Kitui).
- **The Coast Province** (comprises the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Teita, Kilifi, Tara River and Lamu).
- **The Northern Province** (comprises the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, Garissa and Turkana).
- **The Masai District** (comprises the districts of Narok and Kajiado).

**Post-War Reorganisation**

In order to meet efficiently and expeditiously the complexity of post-war conditions and problems of development and reconstruction, plans for the reorganisation of the Government were set on foot early in 1945. Decentralisation of the work hitherto canalised along traditional lines to the Chief Secretary has been by the institution of a system of organising departments in groups under members of the Executive Council.

Under this system the Chief Secretary became "Chief Secretary and Member for Development and Reconstruction." By Government Notice No. 674 of 1st August, 1945, an Authority for Development and Reconstruction was established, with the Chief Secretary as Chairman and Sir Reginald Edwin Robins, General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours (now Member for Transport, East Africa High Commission), and Sir Alfred Vincent, M.C.A., as members. The main powers and duties of the authority are to organise and superintend the execution of works and projects of reconstruction and development in accordance with approved plans communicated to it, and for that purpose to give directions to all departments or groups of departments of the Government. The establishment of the authority is reflected in the division of the estimates into two parts, the first part consisting of the ordinary budget of revenue and expenditure of the Colony and Protectorate, the second part comprising a Development and Reconstruction Fund, expenditure from which is controlled by the authority within the framework of the estimates of the authority as approved by the Legislative Council.

As part of this devolution of authority a Member for Health and Local Government has been appointed to take charge of the medical and local government departments and to represent these departments on the Executive and Legislative Councils. It is intended to establish a Local Government Board to supervise and control the activities of all local authorities, including local native councils which hitherto have not been the concern of the Local Government Department. Local Native Councils will be reconstituted as African district councils with powers and procedure similar to those of municipal authorities and district councils in the settled areas. The Local Government Board will work through standing committees for local government in urban, rural and purely African areas and relieve the Governor-in-Council of certain duties.

In health matters the member is the channel of communication between the Medical Department and the Government, and exercises a general supervision over the work of the department. He is also the Chairman of the Hospital Authority which has been set up to govern European hospitalisation. Municipal authorities are already public health authorities; and other local authorities will increasingly assume public health responsibilities.

A third change has been to designate the Attorney-General as the Member for Law and Order, and he is responsible for all that that title implies. The fourth appointment has been that of a Member for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Natural Resources, who co-ordinates and lays down a general policy for the departments concerned with agriculture, veterinary services, forestry, game, soil and water conservation, research, and settlement, the latter including the settlement and re-settlement of Africans in the native lands, schemes for further European settlement, and investigations into the possibilities of Indian and Arab settlement. The Financial Secretary is now the Member for Finance.

Much of the administrative work hitherto performed by the Chief Secretary has been transferred to the Deputy Chief Secretary, who has been given a seat on the Executive Council as well as on the Legislative Council. The latter's work in turn now falls on the Administrative Secretary. To the Secretariat staff has been
added a Secretary for Commerce and Industry whose services are available to the Development and Reconstruction Authority as well as to the Government.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Schools for Europeans, Indians, Goans, Arabs and Africans exist in all the principal centres in the colony.

Education is compulsory for all European children between the ages of 7 and 15 years, and for Indian boys of that age (not girls) in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.

There are two Government European secondary schools in Nairobi, one for boys and one for girls. These cater for both day scholars and boarders.

Nine Government European primary schools exist, of which four have boarding sections for both boys and girls and one for boys only.

There are also a number of private preparatory and other schools.

For Indians there are 14 Government schools in the towns and larger townships; both primary and secondary education is provided. There are also 62 private schools of which 42 are assisted by grants-in-aid.

In Mombasa there is a combined Government primary and secondary school for Arab boys and also a Government girls school.

The academic education of Africans is organised in two stages: primary and secondary. Primary schools are mostly administered by missions, some being aided by Local Native Councils.

Government maintains 16 African secondary schools and gives financial aid to 35 mission schools. Government also aids 38 African girls' schools.

After the full secondary school course a system of Government bursaries enables suitable students to go to Makerere College in Uganda for further academic education and professional training.

Education fees are as follows:

(a) Schools for European children.

Information Services

The Kenya Information Office was established at the outbreak of war and has operated since then under that title until the middle of 1948 when its name was changed to that of "Press Liaison and African Information Services". The main function of the office is the mass education of Africans and the preparation of material for this purpose on behalf of various Government departments.

The services provided by the office fall roughly into the following heads:

Press

All official communiques and handouts are issued to the European, African and Asian press through the office. Articles on the work of Government departments and matters of general interest are prepared for local press use and for overseas. Two weekly newsletters are prepared, one for overseas use and one for the African vernacular press. A summary of opinions on African affairs expressed in the local press is prepared fortnightly and distributed widely.

Publications

Such booklets as "This is Kenya", "Kenya... 77 Questions Answered" are produced and published by the office for worldwide distribution on sale. Booklets, pamphlets and leaflets are published locally on matters of educational interest for Africans in the Colony. The "K.I.O. Fortnightly"—a bulletin containing matters of interest to European farmers, Government notices, etc.—is distributed to 4,000 addresses. "Pamoja" a Swahili broadsheet for Africans containing background on world affairs and general educational articles is published weekly and 18,000 copies distributed.

Assistance in money and material is given to five district news sheets.

Broadcasting

Broadcasts to Africans are given daily from a studio in the office and transmitted throughout Kenya by Messrs. Cable and Wireless, Ltd. Seven different vernaculars are used. Special broadcasts such as running commentaries on the more important football matches and athletic meetings are given periodically as well as regular quiz competitions and other features.

Three local broadcasts in Swahili are given each week from a studio in Mombasa. Funds for this service and material for the broadcasts are provided by the office.

The office owns and maintains some hundred wireless sets which are distributed to community centres, information rooms, district headquarters, missions, schools, etc. for communal listening to its programmes by Africans.

Still Photographs

The office has a library of some 7,000 photographs on almost every aspect of Kenya life. This is available to the general public, visiting journalists, etc., and much use is made of it.

Filmsstrips for use by Africans are prepared regularly on general educational matters and distributed to the sixty filmsstrip projectors owned and maintained by the office in community centres throughout the Colony. These are operated by Social Welfare Workers who have been trained by the Information Services staff.

It produces printed picture sheets for educational use by Social Welfare Workers in Kenya and issues special educational sets of photographs to all social halls and information rooms. It issues photographs to many parts of the world for exhibition purposes and for use in illustrated papers.

All social halls, community centres, etc., are supplied with sets of photographs, fully captioned for wall display.
Cine Films

The office produces its own 16-mm. cine films of an educational nature, primarily for Africans, and news reels and occasional films for entertainment. These films are used by the Mobile Information Units and some forty projector posts throughout the Colony.

A film library of sound and silent films, supplied by the Central Office of Information, London, and the Colonial Film Unit, are distributed in a similar manner.

The office also distributes 35-mm. British news films to the commercial cinemas in Kenya. These are supplied by the Central Office of Information.

Field work

Four Mobile Information Units are attached to Provincial Commissioners, in the four main provinces. They are constantly on safari, working under the direction of the Provincial Administration, giving cinema shows in the evenings, and lectures supported by filmsstrip shows during the daytime. The majority of the shows are for Africans but European and Asian schools also receive visits from time to time.

Each Unit gives about 250 shows per year.

Despatch and Distribution

In addition to the issue of its own publications the office distributes the Colonial Office publication in Swahili "Siku Hizi", some 4,000 copies of each issue are distributed on sale or return terms to agents throughout the Colony. Posters, booklets, ebonoids, articles, photo sets, etc., received from the Colonial Office and Central Office of Information are also distributed to various lists of addressees in the Colony, selected according to the type of material.

The average weekly output amounts to more than 20,000 items.

Health

The health services of the colony and protectorate are administered through various agencies. With the exceptions mentioned later, the Government Medical Department controls the great majority of hospitals and dispensaries providing facilities for all races.

The Medical Department is responsible for the control and maintenance of all native hospitals whether in townships or native reserves. In the reserves, contributions are made by the Local Native Councils towards the capital costs of maternity wards and of dispensaries; and a similar principle is adopted in townships by contributions from Local Native Trust Funds. Municipal Authorities also provide and manage health clinics and, in some cases, maternity hospitals for Africans and Asians.

There are Government European hospitals at Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. Including the accommodation at Mathari Mental Hospital, Nairobi, 112 beds for Europeans are available. European hospitals are also maintained under local insurance schemes at Nakuru, Eldoret and Kitale. However, under the auspices of the Hospital Authority, a compulsory contributory scheme has been introduced providing hospital maintenance at a very reduced rate at Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, with reimbursements to persons entering the other hospitals mentioned.

There are five European private nursing and maternity homes in Nairobi and one in Mombasa. There is also one European children's hospital as well as two European nursery schools and child welfare clinics in Nairobi.

There are 172 beds for Asian patients in Government Hospitals throughout the country. In Nairobi, in addition to the Indian Maternity Hospital, there is one private Asian nursing home and one private Asian maternity home; in Mombasa there are two private maternity nursing homes.

At native hospitals throughout the reserves and settled areas 4,032 beds for all types of cases, including maternity, are available.

Health services, including port health services, are the sole concern of Government, except in the larger towns, where they are administered by local authorities.

The Government Medical Research Laboratory in Nairobi operates throughout the Colony and Protectorate and manufactures vaccines and other preparations. It comprises several divisions and also accommodates the Government Analytical Chemist. Examinations and reports are available to all medical practitioners. Smaller laboratories are present at all Government hospitals where research work and routine work is carried out and vaccines are manufactured and also a government chemist's department.

Labour

The Labour Department was reorganised and expanded at the beginning of 1946 and is responsible for the inspection of the conditions of labour and the administration of the labour laws of the Colony. Labour officers are posted in most of the important labour centres and, in addition to their inspectorate duties, intervene when required in cases of labour difficulties or disputes. The laws of the Colony in consonance with international conventions provide for certain minimum conditions under which workers may be employed.

At 28th November, 1947, 260,227 men were employed on monthly contracts and in addition 1,100 were employed in the military. In addition some 35,000 families were residing on farms under contract, the adult males of which work for the farm occupiers for a limited period in each year.

Up to 29,000 men, women and juveniles were also at times employed as daily paid casual labour.

Further information with regard to labour services can be obtained from the annual reports of the Labour Department and the Handbook of the Labour Laws, price Shs. 2, both obtainable from the Government Printer.

Welfare

The Social Welfare organisation is not a separate Government Department, but a branch of the African Affairs group within the Secretariat. The Commissioner for Social Welfare is, therefore directly responsible to the Chief Native Commissioner, as are the officers responsible for the African Information Service, Co-operative Societies and other services largely concerned with African development. Social welfare falls into two main divisions—remedial welfare which concerns all races, and African community development.

The remedial welfare work deals with:

(a) Persons without adequate means of subsistence.
(b) Aged or infirm persons.
(c) Orphans, neglected, defective and delinquent children.
(d) Handicapped persons, blind, cripples, etc.
(e) Persons in need of advice and assistance in personal or domestic troubles.
The staff dealing with the above consists of four welfare officers—two European and two Asian ladies. These officers enquire into individual cases working in close co-operation with the various voluntary welfare societies. There is a central committee composed of representatives of the various charitable societies which considers the cases of individuals who make application for assistance from a central destitute persons fund provided by Government. The various communities, however, largely accept the responsibility for the care of the more unfortunate members of their community and this branch of welfare depends very largely on the generosity of the public.

Certain municipalities now have their own welfare organisations, providing their own staff, buildings and equipment. Companies, private firms and individual farmers are now giving much attention to the provision of welfare amenities for their staffs.

Apart from a small headquarter staff, the African community development work is handled by the Administration. Eight District Welfare Officers have been appointed and are members of the District Commissioners' staff. Under them are trained African Welfare Workers. These latter are in charge of community centres set up in selected villages and are paid from local Native Council funds. The centres themselves were built with council funds assisted by Central Government. Some 35 such centres are now in operation. Each centre is run by an African Welfare Committee and usually offer classes to adults, both men and women, in literacy, English, spinning and weaving; discussions, debates, film strip and cinema shows take place; some centres now have their own small libraries, though periodicals, etc., are provided by the Information Service. Missions and various voluntary organisations give their assistance. The Commissioner for Social Welfare also controls a central Composite Training Centre where these welfare workers are trained together with other departmental staff.

**Communications**

**Roads**

There are approximately 16,846 miles of road in Kenya, including all the township roads and dry weather tracks in the Northern Frontier Province and Turkana. These are classified as:

- Bituminous roads . . . 356 miles
- Gravel or murram roads . . 1,612 miles
- Macadamised roads . . . 130 miles
- Earth tracks . . . 14,748 miles

The Great North Road passes through Kenya entering the colony from Tanganyika at Namanga and passing through Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu and on to cross the border into Uganda at Busia. Work is now proceeding on this road, a section 75 miles long from Limuru to Nakuru has been bitumised and opened to traffic. Another 18 mile section between Nairobi and Limuru will be completed before the end of December, 1949. Final survey has been completed between Nakuru and Kisumu. The survey of the Kisumu Busia section is to be commenced shortly. The standards adopted for this road are as follows:

Twenty foot bitumised carriageway, with a ruling gradient of five per cent. and a minimum curvature of 500 feet. The bridges are constructed with a clear width of 24 feet and are designed to carry 12 units of the British Standard Loading, type "A".

Three branch roads from this main route have been under construction. Nairobi-Thika Road has been completed and opened to traffic, and the survey for the extension of this road to Nyeri and Nanyuki is well in hand. Lumbwa-Sotik Road has been completed and opened to traffic. Kericho-Muhoroni Road has been completed and is open to all traffic. The survey for another branch, 115 miles from Mau Station to connect Eldoret and Kitale with the Trunk Road System, is nearing completion.

**Shipping**

The Union Castle Mail Steamship Company and the British India Steam Navigation Co. maintain a monthly service of passenger steamers from and to London. The Union Castle vessels run either via the Cape or Suez.

The Messageries Maritimes from Marseilles to Madagascar call fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards. Only one ship is at present in operation.

The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintains a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool; also a service from the U.S.A. and Canada, and a monthly service to Australia via South Africa.

The Holland Afrika Line maintains a fortnightly service from London and Continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this port.

India-Africa Line (Andrew Weir & Co.) connect monthly with India and South Africa.

Farnwell Lines (Inc.) connect U.S.A. monthly via South African ports.

Robin Line connect the United States of America monthly via South African ports.

A fortnightly mail service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company's passenger and cargo steamers. The northbound ships connect at Bombay with the P. & O. mail steamers to England.

A monthly passenger service is maintained with Batavia via southern ports by the Royal Packet Company of Holland.

A cargo service is maintained by the "Silver Java Pacific Line" from America via South African ports to Java and back to America via Pacific.

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co. and Holland Africa Line.

The B.I.S.N. Co. also maintain a monthly service to and from Australia.

**Currency and Banking**

The standard coin is the East African shilling (silver) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (silver) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). A note issue is maintained and notes of the following denominations are in circulation: Shs. 10,000, Shs. 1,000, Shs. 200, Shs. 100, Shs. 20, Shs. 10, Shs. 5' and Shs. 1.

The currency is controlled by the East African Currency Board, London, which replaced the old local Board of Currency Commissioners in 1921. The Board is represented in the East African Territories (Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar) by local Currency Officers.

The National Bank of India, Ltd. (Head Office, 26, Bishopsgate, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and Kericho, and at Kampala, Entebbe, Jinja and Mbale in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office 10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Nanyuki and Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and at Kampala, Jinja and Mbale in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated the National Bank of South Africa, Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale, Eldoret, Kisumu and Thompson's Falls in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

**Land and Products**

With altitudes varying from sea level to over 9,000 feet, Kenya lends itself to the production of a wide range of crops. In the areas above 5,000 feet coffee, tea, maize, wattle bark, pyrethrum and wheat are the principal crops. At the lower altitudes sisal, cotton and oilseeds are most important. Other crops grown in various parts of the colony include beans, potatoes, sorghums, millets, pulses, coconuts, cashew nuts, sugar cane, vegetables, fruit and essential oil plants.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an increasingly important role in the general agricultural policy of the Colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skin, wool and bacon are produced annually.

The local market is well supplied with the main food staples and local factories produce jams, cordials, canned fruit, sweets, biscuits, oatmeal, etc.

During the war by increasing the production of all main crops, Kenya played an important part in supplying the greatly increased wartime consumption of East Africa, due to the presence of many thousands of troops, prisoners, refugees and evacuees. During the general post-war shortage Kenya production has been maintained at a high level, but the normal internal demand has also increased substantially, thus reducing the surplus available for export. Nevertheless, the export of agricultural and animal produce reached a total value of £6,011,274 in 1946 as compared with £3,200,629 in 1937.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and on Lake Victoria, and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

During the war the forests of the Colony successfully met the heavy demands of the armed forces for building timber and of the railways for wood fuel. On the coast mangrove poles and bark, muhuhu, timber, and gum copal are the main products. In the highland forests are found large quantities of pencil cedar and several other good timbers such as podocarpus, E African olive and camphor, also large areas of bamboos. A scheme is projected for planting 100,000 acres of conifers over a twelve year period, an important feature being the comparatively short period—25 years—in which conifers reach maturity under the conditions of high rainfall, tropical sunshine and altitude peculiar to Kenya.

The following minerals have been located:

- **Gold.**—Has been found throughout the Nyanza Province and in the Lolgorien district of the Masai reserve. Traces of gold have been found in various areas occupied by Basement System rocks.

- **Silver.**—Is commonly associated with gold in Nyanza and also occurs in galena ores in the Coast Province.

- **Amblygonite.**—Has been found sporadically in pegmatites in Basement System areas.

- **Apatite.**—Has been located in small concentrations near Homa Bay in Southern Kavirondo.

- **Arsenopyrite.**—Is commonly associated with the gold mineralisation of Nyanza.

- **Asbestos.**—Of anthophyllite type occurs in Basement System rocks and is worked in West Suk.

- **Barytes.**—Of good quality is found in association with lead and zinc ores in the Coast Province.
Beryl.—Small amounts have been found in pegmatites particularly in Machakos.

Clays.—Of meta-bentonite type have been found at Athi River, near Nairobi, and north of Mount Kenya. Ceramics clays are known in the Central and Coast Provinces.

Columbite.—Sporadic occurrences of columbite-tantalite have been found in Basement System pegmatites.

Copper.—Impregnations occur in association with pegmatites in the Tsavo area. Promising gold-copper deposits are being developed in Southern Kavirondo (Nyanza Province).

Corundum.—Occurs in association with a dunite intrusion near Mtito Andei (Machakos).

Gypsum.—Is found in the Northern Frontier District especially near El-Wak and Garissa.

Ilmenite.—Is widespread in areas of Basement System rocks.

Iron.—Magnetite and magnetite-haematite quartzites occur in the Basement System and form a possible source of ore for future requirements. Gossans and pyritic ore bodies in the goldfields of Nyanza are an additional possible source.

Kyanite.—Is found in the Machakos area and sometimes occurs in fine crystals that have been at times cut as gems. Extensive deposits of massive and unusually pure kyanite are being worked in the Taveta area (Coast Province).

Limestone.—Coral and other limestones are abundant in the Coast Province, and enormous quantities of crystalline limestone are available in Basement System areas, notably near Voi, Kajiado, Machakos, the Loldaika hills, Elgeyo and Suk. Lacustrine limestones are worked near Muhoroni and Homa Bay in Western Kenya. Extensive deposits of limestone of carbonatite type are also known in the Homa Bay area.

Zircon.—Is an abundant constituent of river sands in Nyanza and the Coast Province.

TRADE, CUSTOMS AND EXCISE

Under the terms of the Congo Basin Treaties equality of treatment in respect of imported goods irrespective of origin is ensured, and the grant of Imperial Preference is therefore inadmissible. Goods declared as in transit are allowed to be imported and forwarded under customs control on payment of expenses of administration (6d. per package).

For purposes of customs, Kenya and Uganda form a single unit and by agreement with the Tanganyika Territory Government a common tariff has been accepted by the three territories, the free and unrestricted movement within the territories of both imported goods and local products being thus secured. The common tariff, however, includes a small number of "suspended duties" which are of a protective nature and may be imposed by proclamation either in part or in full in any or all of the territories.

The general duty rating under the common tariff is 22 per cent. ad valorem, based on the landed value at the port of entry, building materials, artisans' tools, and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on such articles as readily lend themselves to this form of assessment and in certain cases alternative specific or ad valorem charges are levied. Exemption from duty is
allowed on drugs and medicines, packing materials, disinfectants, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, and many articles necessary for road construction, sanitation, irrigation and drainage purposes, and for the agricultural, industrial, and educational development of the territories.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of trade imports (excluding imports on Government account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya ports, were as follows:
