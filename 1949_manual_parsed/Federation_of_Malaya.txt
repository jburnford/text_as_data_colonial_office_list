FEDERATION OF MALAYA

SITUATION AND AREA

The territories comprising the Federation of Malaya are situated in the southern section of the Kra Peninsula which protrudes at the south-eastern corner of Asia between India and China, between latitudes 1° and 7° N. and longitudes 100° and 105° E. The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,850 square miles, rather more than twice the size of the island of Ceylon and slightly larger than England without Wales. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang, which is twice the area of Lancashire and Yorkshire combined and the smallest is the State of Perlis which is about twice the size of Rutland.

The State of Perlis lies on the north-west coast of the Peninsula and is bounded by a range of mountains running north and south which separates it from the Siamese province of Setul. On the east the boundary is with the Siamese province of Nakon Sridhammaraj and the Malay State of Kedah, which is bordered on the interior by the Siamese States of Songkhla and Patani and by the State of Perak. The Muda River separates it from Province Wellesley.

The State of Perak stretches south from Province Wellesley, Kedah and Siam and is separated from Kelantan and Pahang on the east by the main range of mountains that form the backbone of the Peninsula. On the south, the Bernam River separates the State from Selangor, which is bordered on the east by the State of Pahang and on the south by the State of Negri Sembilan.

Stretching north on the east coast between the northern border of Pahang and the Siamese boundary lie the two States of Trengganu and Kelantan.

In the extreme south of the Malay Peninsula lies the State of Johore. Four-fifths of the surface of the Peninsula is covered by dense tropical jungle. The only generally cleared parts of the country are the long stretches down the west coast, an area in the north and a number of open stretches up the principal rivers. The State of Trengganu, for example, is divided into sixteen river basins all of which empty into the China Sea.

CLIMATE

The principle features of the Malayan climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of Northern latitudes. The months between these two seasons which correspond with spring and autumn of Northern latitudes are the wettest months over most parts of Malaya. Coastal districts however, have their own peculiar rainy seasons.

Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year, though the annual fall varies considerably from place to place and year to year. Jelebu, in Negri Sembilan, is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches and Maxwell's Hill the wettest with 198 inches a year.

The average maximum temperature in the plains is rather less than 90° F. and minimum about 70° F. At hill stations temperatures are considerably lower; at Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 79° F. and 36° F. and at Fraser's Hill 81° F. and 53° F.

The nights are reasonably cool everywhere and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not obtained at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative, and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate becomes imperative if health is to be maintained.

The average monthly rainfall for 1947 was 9·08 inches. The average maximum temperature in the plains was 88·5° F. and the average minimum was 72·8° F. The highest temperature 99° F. was recorded at Ipoh on 17th February and the lowest temperature 63° F. was recorded at Jelebu on 20th July.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Kra Peninsula is divided by mountain ranges the principal trend of which is north and south. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains which are mainly alluvial and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80 per cent. of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp, 14 per cent. under rubber, 2·4 per cent. under padi and 2·1 per cent. under coconuts and oil palms.

The Malay rivers at their sources and in their upper reaches are quick flowing, often with tortuous rapids and precipitous gorges.

In the lower reaches, the descent is more gradual and the water takes on a muddy hue from contamination with the silt of the plains through which they meander, debouching ultimately through strips of mangrove swamp, particularly on the west coast.

The two principal rivers of the Peninsula are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter being some ten miles shorter than the River Thames. It springs in the main range of mountains, the highest of which is Gunong Tahan which rises to over 7,000 feet at its summit. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory south of the Himalayas, while there are half a dozen prominencies which would comfortably overshadow Ben Nevis. That part of the country free from the torrid luxuriance of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other stretches have been scarred by the incisions of industry as in the Kinta Valley of Perak, which opens out into a monotonous prospect of silver-grey silt, the residuum of tin extraction.

The coast-line of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat fringed with infrequent indentations of picturesque bays fringed with coconut palms and the graceful spires of the casuarina. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand and surf bordered by a littoral vegetation which lends to it a beauty possibly unparalleled in the tropics.

Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands off the North Kedah coast rising to over 2,000 feet wrapped in wild and rugged beauty. Farther south there is the island of Penang, picturesque in a different way, whose features have been eulogised by travellers from the earliest histories. The island of Pangkor off the coast of Perak was once a Dutch settlement but little remains in evidence of this history beneath the vegetation which has long since reclaimed its own.

Finally, off the east coast among a sprinkle of beautiful islands there is Tioman with its symbolic silhouette of granite peaks.
POPULATION

The first post-war census of the Federation of Malaya was held on the 23rd September, 1947, when a total of 4,908,086 persons, excluding transient categories, were enumerated, giving a mean population density of 97 per square mile.

As the following comparisons of the main components of this population show, there has been an increase in the population since 1931 of 29·6 per cent. notwithstanding a drop of nearly 42,000 in the number of Indians. The Malaysian and Chinese components have increased by 30·3 per cent. and 46·7 per cent. respectively:

|        | 1931     | 1947     |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Malaysians | 1,863,872 | 2,427,834 |
| Chinese   | 1,284,888 | 1,884,534 |
| Indians   | 572,613   | 530,638   |
| Europeans | 9,534     | 9,607     |
| Eurasians | 9,096     | 10,061    |
| Others    | 47,755    | 45,412    |
| Total     | 3,787,758 | 4,908,086 |

Out of the Malaysian total, 265,803 are immigrants from various parts of Indonesia and the adjacent Dutch territories or descendants of such immigrants who have not yet been fully assimilated with the Malay population.

RELIGION

The Muslim religion is practised by the Malays, who are Sunni Muslims of the Shah'i School. The Malay Rulers are the titular religious heads of their Muslim subjects in each State. The Muslim community also includes a number of the local Indian population and a lesser number of persons of other races.

There are Christian churches in most of the larger towns of Malaya and the Christian community includes an appreciable number of local Asians.

Hinduism is the religion of the majority of the Indian labourers and of a large number of the local Indian population of all classes, including the Chettiar.

Buddhism is practised by a section of the Chinese and Indian communities and by the small Siamese groups. The Sikh community follow the religious belief of that name.

Amongst the Chinese population may be found a variety of beliefs which include Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, with the addition of the worship of a number of local deities.

Little is known of the beliefs of the primitive aboriginal tribes of the interior, but they are said to practise forms of Shamanism and Animism.

HISTORY

European power in Malaya may be dated from 1511, when a Portuguese fleet captured Malacca; it succeeded to periods of Indian and Islamic influence. Indian traders from the Coromandel coast, arriving in the Peninsula in about the first century A.D., found the aboriginal inhabitants living by fishing and the most primitive agriculture. The Indians, beginning to settle in the country and intermarry with the aborigines, built the first towns; the chief one, which stood on the River Merbok in Kedah, was known in Malay records as Langkasuka. Eventually there emerged an Indo-Malayan kingdom called Sri-Vijaya, of which the capital was at one time at Palembang in Sumatra, but may later have been at Langkasuka. This Indian influence, which had replaced the aboriginal tribal organisation by the rule of Rajas, had disseminated Buddhism, and had added to the Malay language a large number of Sanskrit words, together with the Indian alphabets, lasted until about the fifteenth century, when Muslim missionaries began to undermine it. Indians, Persians and Arabians, they had come to Sumatra a century earlier, and soon spread to the Peninsula. By the seventeenth century Indian culture and religion had yielded to those of Islam; the Arabic alphabet was introduced, Arabic words came into the language, and Indian aesthetics gave place to Muslim austerity. A great part in this process was played by Iskander Muda, Sultan of Acheen in northern Sumatra, whose piratical hordes swept through Malaya, massacring and pillaging, and at the same time compelling conversion to Islam at the point of the sword. Meanwhile European power was beginning. The Portuguese in Malacca succeeded a Malay kingdom which, founded by a dispossessed ruler of Tumasik (the modern Singapore), had extended its sway over much of the peninsula. They held Malacca from 1511 to 1641, when they were dispossessed by the Dutch. The Portuguese were crusaders even more than traders, and made themselves detested by the Malays by their compulsory conversions to Christianity. In contrast, the Dutch concerned themselves almost entirely with trade during their 150 years of rule in Malacca, jealously guarding their monopoly of the tin and spice trades. But neither the Portuguese nor the Dutch extended their rule beyond the town of Malacca. It was to break the Dutch trading monopoly that the British first settled in Malaya. Francis Light, in 1786, obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795, during the Napoleonic wars; it served as a base for the successful attack on Dutch Java by Lord Minto and Sir Stamford Raffles. Raffles became Lieutenant-Governor of Java; but in 1814 Java and Malacca alike were handed back to the Dutch. Raffles, with his far-seeing vision, held this to be a grave mistake, and by continued representations to the company secured permission to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. He obtained a concession from the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore, and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. Raffles' vision was proved not only by his choice of a site, but by his determination to make it a free port. With these two advantages Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the Entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands as the third of the Straits Settlements in 1824, when by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London Malaya was recognised as a British sphere of influence. Raffles strongly favoured British expansion in Malaya; but after his early death in 1826 the parsimonious conservatism of the East India Company frowned on such a policy. However, in 1858 the Straits Settlements came under the control of the India Office, and in 1867 of the Colonial Office, while such factors as the danger to the British position latent in the huge concessions of land granted at this time by the Sultans to Europeans and others, the growing interest in the tin, and subsequently rubber, which could be obtained from Malaya, and a deterioration of the political situation of the...
Malay States into civil war and disorder, hastened the extension of British authority in the Peninsula. In 1873 Sir Andrew Clarke, the new Governor of the Straits, came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan, and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam, after long negotiations, transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern states, and there resulted agreements in the same year with Kedah, Kelantan and Perlis, and in 1919 with Trengganu. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were in their main features similar: the Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in return guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each state a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the rulers agreed to follow on all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The early residents were faced with great difficulties. The new methods of raising revenue which became necessary to finance the development of the country aroused great hostility, to which the forbidding of slavery and of forced labour added. There were risings in Perak in 1874 and in Pahang in 1891-1892. In time, however, the residents, by patience and conciliation, overcame these difficulties; and the foundations laid by such early residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories of the Colonial Empire. Politically, the main change in the early years of the century was the formation of the Federated Malay States. Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a federation with a resident general as chief executive officer, and a system of centralised government was inaugurated which lasted in varying forms until 1932. In that year there was a measure of decentralisation; legislative powers were to some extent restored to the states and the authority of the rulers and residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt halt during Japanese occupation from December, 1941, to August, 1945.

During the period of British military administration Sir Harold MacMichael negotiated with Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers new agreements under which they transferred full sovereignty and jurisdiction to His Majesty the King, thereby opening the way for the establishment of the Malayan Union by Order in Council on 1st April, 1946. It had been planned at the same time to establish a form of common citizenship, but, in view of the strong objections put forward by the Malays to the form of these proposals, the Order in Council which would have given effect to them was not made. The Malays also objected to the transfer of sovereignty, and feared domination by the non-Malay communities as a result of the proposed new citizenship. On 25th July, 1946, a working committee, consisting of representatives of Government, of Their Highnesses the Rulers, and of the United Malays' National Organisation, was appointed to submit agreed views, if possible, for both sides to examine and criticise. Its Report, published in December, 1946, recommended a federation in which each state and settlement would retain its individuality under a strong central government; and qualifications for a form of common citizenship. These proposals received the conditional approval of His Majesty's Government on 11th December, 1946. To enable all interested communities to have free and full opportunity of expressing their views a Consultative Committee was appointed, composed mainly of influential members of the non-Malay communities. After receiving oral and written representations throughout the country the Consultative Committee published its report on 31st March, 1947. After further discussion with Their Highnesses the Rulers and the representatives of U.M.N.O., the scheme which finally emerged, and which followed in the main that proposed in December, 1946, although differing on several important points of detail, was finally accepted by His Majesty's Government in July, 1947, when its main features were summarised in a White Paper (Cmd. 7171). The signature of agreements between His Majesty and each Malay Ruler, and of a Federation Agreement to embrace the arrangements as a whole followed on 21st January, 1948, and the new Constitution came into force on 1st February, 1948.

CONSTITUTION

The Federation of Malaya, which succeeded the Malayan Union, came into being on 1st February, 1948, on the conclusion of the Federation of Malaya Agreement between His Majesty the King and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States. The Federation consists of the nine Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Trengganu and the two British settlements of Penang and Malacca. His Majesty the King and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States have power to admit any other territory into the Federation by mutual agreement. Under the Federation Agreement there is a Conference of Rulers which is consulted on matters of special concern to the Malay States and in particular on immigration policy.

The Central Government, which was set up under the Federation Agreement, and to which legislation on matters of importance to the whole country is reserved, consists of a High Commissioner appointed by His Majesty, a Federal Executive Council, and a Federal Legislative Council. The Legislative Council consists of 75 members: 14 official and ex officio, the 9 Menri Besar or chief ministers of the Malay States, 2 representing the Settlement Councils, and 50 unofficial, these last nominated on a mainly non-racial basis to represent important vocations and interests. New legislation is enacted jointly by the High Commissioner and Their Highnesses the Rulers. The new provisions concerning citizenship are summarized in Cmd. 7171.

Each State is governed under a written Constitution by its Ruler assisted by a State Executive Council and a Council of State, and each Settlement has a Settlement Council. His Majesty the King, through the High Commissioner, exercises control over questions of defence and external relations.

The Federation Agreement also records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress shall be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as circumstances permit for the election of members to the several legislatures established under the Agreement.
ADMINISTRATION

Under the Federal constitution the executive authority in each State is vested in the Ruler, who is aided and advised by his Executive Council; it extends to all matters not included in the Federal legislative list. The Councils of State and the Settlement Councils have legislative powers in such matters as are not reserved for the Federal authority. The Federal estimates provide separately for the income and expenditure of each of the States and Settlements, and for block grants from Federal revenue to make up the deficiency of their own revenues.

The seat of the Federal Government is at Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of most Federal Departments and of the Military Command (Malaya District). In each state there is a British Adviser as adviser to the State Government and officers of the various Federal departments who, while being responsible to the heads of their own departments, work closely with State officers. Most of the administrative officers in districts are Asians trained in Malaya.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

During the Japanese occupation education in the real sense of the word ceased to exist. Many schools were turned into barracks and stores and those that were allowed to continue were turned into propaganda machines. But, since the liberation, rehabilitation has proceeded apace and there are now over twice as many pupils in the schools as there were before the war. Primary education is given in Malay, Chinese and Indian vernacular schools, of which there are nearly 4,000. In the Malay schools no fees are charged and attendance is compulsory for boys; among girls, too, there is great keenness for education, and the number of girls attending schools increases constantly. Chinese schools are mainly run by committees of the Chinese community, education following the usual Chinese school syllabus. It is estimated that 60 per cent. of Chinese children attend them. Indian schools are mostly on the estates, supervised by the estate managers: they receive generous grants including salaries of teachers on the approved scales. Chinese schools are visited by Government inspectors, who report whether they are of the standard of efficiency required to qualify them for a Government grant.

English schools are mostly secondary in scope, although many have primary schools attached. Pupils of all races are admitted, either direct or from vernacular schools, in many cases without fees being required, and receive education up to school certificate standard. The Malay College at Kuala Kangsar and the Malay Girls' College at Kuala Lumpur are residential schools following the secondary school curriculum of the English schools.

Higher education for Malaya is provided by Raffles' College and the King Edward VII College of Medicine, both at Singapore, while scholarships are available for students who wish to study in the United Kingdom. Arrangements are now being made (as a result of the recommendations of a Report on Higher Education presented by the Commission of which Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders was Chairman) for the creation at Johore Bahru of a University of Malaya, of which the two Singapore colleges will form the nucleus. In the Federation, the Technical College at Kuala Lumpur provides training in engineering, and the College of Agriculture at Serdang in agriculture, with special reference to local problems. The Sultan Idris Training College and the Malay Women's Training College train Malay teachers; further training schemes have been initiated to relieve the serious shortage of teachers.

Information Services

Since the liberation of Malaya a Department of Public Relations has been established charged with responsibility for the presentation of accurate factual information regarding Government policy to the people of Malaya and the dissemination of information about Malaya overseas. The Department also selects books for translation into vernacular languages and attempts to encourage a sense of Malayan Unity and sponsor civic consciousness.

Health

The climate of Malaya is healthy but monotonously warm with a high humidity.

The grave deterioration in health caused by the Japanese occupation has been ameliorated; health and medical services have been restored to nearly pre-war standards.

The latest developments in the treatment and prophylaxis of important tropical diseases such as malaria and tropical typhus are closely followed and put into practice.

The postwar increase in the incidence of tuberculosis has given rise to schemes to combat this disease. Epidemic smallpox is now under control and practically eradicated. Sixty-five General and District Hospitals in which 13,500 beds are provided, are maintained by Government, as well as institutions for lepers, mental diseases, infectious diseases; also V.D. clinics and dental clinics. One hundred and ninety-one private hospitals with 6,700 beds are maintained on rubber estates. In the larger towns housing shortage is a serious problem and water supplies are treated according to modern methods. Sewage disposal by domestic septic tanks is the practice in use in suburban areas, but conservancy methods are a feature of the built-up areas. Malaria is controlled in towns and villages by anti-larval methods.

The treatment of the rural population is carried out by means of fixed and travelling dispensaries and welfare clinics. 2,851,753 patients were treated either as out-patients or in-patients during 1947.

Child Welfare Centres are established in all densely populated parts of the country.

The Institute for Medical Research deals with a wide range of investigations, amongst which those on tropical typhus, malaria and nutritional problems are the most prominent.

Labour

Labour was very unsettled in the early part of the year due mainly to the inexpérience of some trade union officers who in addition to ignorance of the facts of industrial and commercial life were in too much of a hurry to achieve a workers' millennium or had in view matters other than the welfare of the workers they represented.

The period May to August was a difficult one as wage rates had not kept pace with the cost of living and both Government and industrial employees were most restive. The implementation in full by the Government of the Joint Wages Commission's Interim Report did much to ease the tension and indicate a national wage standard.
From August to the end of the year wages improved, as the two most important employers' associations, the Malayan Mining Employers' Association and the Malayan Planting Industries Employers' Association, were quick to adjust wage rates as the price of rubber and tin increased and at the same time there was a definite drop in the cost of living.

It was obvious, however, at the end of the year that in spite of wage increases and the drop in the cost of living those militant trade unions which were dominated by the Communists were determined to disrupt production and force their aims upon the workers even though labour was, on the whole, satisfied with the progress which had been made during the period under review.

Welfare

In June, 1946, a Department of Social Welfare was established and for the first twelve months was concerned chiefly with the relief of distress resulting from the Japanese occupation. A welfare officer has now been appointed to each State and Settlement in the Federation of Malaya, and a wide programme of social services is planned.

Communications

Roads

The road system covers 6,076 miles, of which 4,166 miles are concrete or bitumenised, the bulk of the remainder being waterbound metalled surface.

Neglect during the 3½ years Japanese occupation has been partially repaired, shortage of bitumen being the chief hindrance.

The largest road bridge, over the Perak River, has been restored, and many smaller bridges, demolished by British or Japanese forces, have been replaced. Many still remain to be done, including those of large span, and Bailey bridges are still carrying the traffic until permanent structures can be built. On part of the East Coast Road, practically all the timber bridges constructed under Japanese direction collapsed due to inferior timber and construction.

The load intensity on many main roads increased to 2½ times that carried pre-war.

Rail

The Railway System serves Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. From Singapore Island the railway crosses to the mainland by the Johore Causeway. The main line then runs roughly parallel to the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula, but at some distance inland, to Prai on the west coast opposite the Island of Penang. This main west coast line is 488 miles long. From Bukit Mertajam (7 miles south of Prai), a line branches off the main line and continues in a northerly direction to the Siamese frontier at Padang Besar, the junction with the Royal State Railways of Siam, 99 miles from Bukit Mertajam. Lines branch from the main line to serve railway-operated ports at Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson and Port Weld. A branch line, 22 miles long, which connected the port of Malacca with the main line, was removed by the Japanese during their 3½ years of occupation, and has not yet been replaced.

The East Coast line branches from the main line at Gemas (137 miles from Singapore) and runs in a northerly direction through the States of Negri Sembilan, Pahang and Kelantan, and terminates at the port of Tumpat on the east coast close to the Siamese border. The distance from Gemas to Tumpat is 327 miles. At Pasir Mas, 16 miles south of Tumpat, a branch line 13 miles long runs to connect with the Royal State Railways of Siam at the border station of Sungei Golok. The Japanese removed 200 miles of the line between Mentakab (Pahang), and Krai (Kelantan). The work of restoring this 200 miles length has begun, and 33 miles of line have been relaid from Mentakab to Jerantut.

A through service is run once a week between Prai (Penang) and Bangkok, the Siamese capital; the journey now takes approximately 31 hours owing to the destruction of the railway bridge at Surat Thani (Siam), whereas the pre-war journey was done in 26 hours. As a temporary measure, pending the re-laying of the through East Coast Line, a twice-weekly train service is maintained between Prai (Penang) and Kelantan via the Siam Southern Line (Padang Besar–Sungei Golok).

Buffet cars and sleeping saloons are provided on the night mail trains between Prai and Singapore.

First class fares are at the rate of 12½ cents per mile.

Shipping

On the liberation of Malaya a unified Marine Department was formed in place of the former Straits Settlements Marine and individual State Marine Departments and the Department now covers the whole of the Federation under the administration of the Marine Superintendent.

Rehabilitation of major ports started with the arrival of our occupation forces and made rapid progress, resulting in quick increases of shipping and tonnage handled, and at Port Swettenham especially the number of ships calling at the port and amount of cargo handled in comparison to pre-war figures is most marked. Coastal shipping has become firmly re-established and with the acquisition of a fleet of small vessels built for war service the Straits Steamship Company have regular sailings in local waters. With the aid of ex-Japanese motor tongkangs and various converted types of vessels the entrepot trade was quickly under way and although Dutch restrictions and other delays have affected this much of it continues and a system of barter trade with Sumatra was recently tried in order to assist the flow of reciprocal trade. Sailing junks continue to ply on both east and west coasts in large numbers despite the influx of so many small motor vessels after the war. Piracy was not inactive, on the west coast particularly, but no doubt the recently imposed death penalty for carrying arms is having a repressive effect on this. Shipping was assisted very quickly after the re-occupation by the rapid re-establishment of navigational lights and aids throughout the waters of the Federation and old oil lanterns formerly used on the east coast have been replaced by automatic flashing lights.

The following shipping figures for Penang, Port Swettenham, Malacca and Teluk Anson were recorded in 1947:—
Air

The International Airline Operating Companies which include B.O.A.C., Qantas and K.L.M., provide scheduled services between Singapore and the continents of Europe and Australia. In addition, air services connect Singapore with capitals in the Netherlands East Indies, Siam, French Indo-China, Hong Kong, Burma, India and Ceylon.

Malaya is provided with a very efficient domestic air service operated by Malayan Airways, Ltd., who, in addition to running daily services between Singapore and centres in the Federation, operate frequent schedules to points in the N.E.I. and to Siam.

Projected services in South-East Asia which will affect Malaya include routes from Singapore to Shanghai (via Bangkok and Hong Kong) and to Manila via Borneo.

Although modern aerodromes, telecommunications and navigational aid equipment are still in short supply, the air routes at present being operated in this region are provided with the minimum ground organisation required to maintain the safe operation of all these services.

The international and domestic air services operating through Malaya have surpassed considerably the services available to the general public at the outbreak of the last war, and they will increase and expand still further during the coming year.

The completion of the new International Airport at Tengah will go far towards enabling Singapore to maintain its position as a focal point of trade communications in South East Asia.

Posts

The former postal services of the States have been unified into one postal Administration for the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore. There is rapid and reliable delivery by postmen and increasing use is being made of the internal air services. The Post Office Savings Bank operates at all post offices and the amount of savings on deposit is increasing rapidly. New postage stamps for each State and Settlement have been ordered and are expected to be on sale at post offices early in 1949.

Telecommunications

The Telecommunications Department, Malaya is a pan-Malayan Department serving the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore, except in so far as the local telephone services of Singapore and Johore Bahru are concerned which are operated by a private company.

There are telegraph services throughout Malaya and links with Cable and Wireless, Ltd. There are nearly 200 telephone exchanges throughout the Peninsula.

The re-establishment of radio telephone links between Malaya and the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries is in hand and the first-named service will probably commence in 1949.

Subsidiary services such as teleprinters on the lines of "Telex" exist and certain V.H.F. links between points where normal land line cannot be used have been established.

Broadcasting

It is intended eventually to serve every part of the Peninsula with two simultaneous programmes, using the English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil languages. This aim is at present only partly achieved, but news bulletins, talks and varied entertainment programmes are broadcast from the main centres of population.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The legal currency of the Malayan Union is the Malayan dollar which is on the Sterling Exchange Standard fixed at the value of 2s. 4d. per dollar. It is governed by the various State Currency Enactments.

There is no central bank in the Union and therefore there is no official bank rate. The terms on which credit is offered as well as the scale of charges for banking services are fixed by the members of the Malayan Exchange Banks Association.

The following comparative figures of Post Office Savings Bank transactions for the years 1946 and 1947 cover the Malayan Union with the exception of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca:

|                | 1946       | 1947       |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| Number of open accounts | $142,557.00 | $165,212.00 |
| Number of transactions    | $308,389.00 | $382,379.00 |
| Liability to depositors exclusive of interest | $21,450,728.70 | $27,843,627.90 |
| Turnover                | $29,934,477.29 | $40,245,101.67 |

Foreign Exchange Control was inaugurated in the Malayan Union on 4th January, 1946, in conformity with the system already in force throughout the sterling area or "Scheduled Territories" as they are now known.

A feature of Exchange Control in Malaya is the system of allowing remittances by Chinese up to a limit of $45 per month for the maintenance of their families in China. This system is operated through remittance shops who undertake to collect money, write letters from the remitter to beneficiary, and through an agent in China deliver the money, write the acknowledgment at the dictation of the beneficiary, and deliver the reply. This concession represents a considerable export of resources to China, for which, from a Foreign Exchange viewpoint, no consideration is received in return.

A recent revision of the conditions under which remittance shops are permitted to operate has been made, which provides that such shops can operate only under permit issued by the Controller. At the same time, a substantial deposit or a bank's guarantee is required from remittance shops in order to afford protection of the remitters.

Another aspect which is of interest is the trade carried on between Malaya, on the one hand and Sumatra, Java and the islands adjacent to Malaya on the other. This trade is known as "Chinchew" trade and is a very important one in normal times, but during the period under review owing to the difficulties—political and otherwise in Sumatra—it has been restricted. The system operates in the following manner.

A Chinchew trader exports by Tongkang to an adjacent territory a cargo of Malayan goods and brings back a cargo of approximately the equivalent value of local produce. Alternatively, he may take with him a certain amount of Malayan money to non-Malayan territories in which Malayan currency circulates, and there purchase local produce "which he brings to this country, sells, and buys local produce acceptable in adjacent territories. Malayan currency may not, however, be exported to or imported from those parts of the N.E.I. which come within N.E.I. Customs jurisdiction. In such cases, any balance which cannot be settled by barter, may be transferred through banking channels."
