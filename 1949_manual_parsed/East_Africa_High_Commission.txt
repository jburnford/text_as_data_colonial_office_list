EAST AFRICA HIGH COMMISSION

Constitution, Scope and Legislative Powers

The establishment of an East Africa High Commission, with effect from 1st January, 1948, to replace the East African Governors' Conference, was announced in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 28th July, 1947.

The High Commission, consisting of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, was constituted by the East Africa (High Commission) Order in Council, 1947, and administers the following inter-Territorial services, which were in existence at the date of its establishment:

(1) The Secretariat of the High Commission.
(2) The East African Anti-Locust-Directorate.
(3) The East African Directorate of Civil Aviation.
(4) The East African Directorate of Training.
(5) The East African Income Tax Department.
(6) The East African Industrial Council.
(7) The East African Inter-Territorial Languages Committee.
(8) The East African Office in London.
(9) The East African Posts and Telegraphs Department.
(10) The East African Production and Supply Council, and all matters within the sphere of such Council.
(11) The East African Publicity Committee.
(12) The East African Refugee Administration.
(13) The East African Research Services.
(14) The East African Statistical Department.
(15) The East African Tsetse Reclamation Department.
(16) The Lake Victoria Fisheries Board.
(17) The East African Meteorological Department.
(18) Services connected with the maintenance of contact between the Territories and the Defence Services.
(19) Services arising out of the functions of the High Commission as East African Air Transport Authority.
(20) Services of Inter-Territorial import arising from the operation in the Territories of the East African Currency Board.

In the course of 1948 the following additional services fell, upon their formation, within the administrative sphere of the High Commission:

(1) The East African Railways and Harbours Administration.
(2) The East African Literature Bureau.

The East African Customs and Excise Department is to be formed as a High Commission service, with effect from 1st January, 1949.

Under the Order in Council the following services will also be administered by the High Commission upon their formation:

(1) The East African Information Office.
(2) The East African Radio-communications Service.
(3) The East African Regional Geological Survey.
(4) The East African Regional Topographical Survey.
(5) Inter-Territorial Services financed, in whole or part, by means of grants made to the High Commission from the East African Regional Allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.
(6) Such further Research Services as may be set up on an East African basis.

The East African Central Legislative Assembly, established by the Order in Council, is presided over by a Speaker and consists of seven ex-officio members who are officers in the High Commission's Service, three nominated official members (one from each Territory) and 13 unofficial members, one elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of each Territory, one European, one Indian and one African member appointed by the Governor of each Territory (in Kenya the European and Indian members are elected by the European and Indian members respectively of the Legislative Council) and one Arab member appointed by the High Commission. The Assembly held its first meeting on the 6th April, 1948.

The High Commission, whose headquarters is at Nairobi, in Kenya, has power to legislate, with the advice and consent of the assembly, in respect of the inter-Territorial services. It also has power to legislate with the advice and consent of the Legislative Councils of the three Territories on any matter concerned with the peace, order and good government of the Territories.
Apart from the fact that the High Commission has assumed responsibility for the administration of the services specified, the establishment of the High Commission has involved no change in the constitution or administrative responsibilities of the Governments of the three Territories, which remain responsible for the basic services such as administration, police, health, education, agriculture, animal health, forestry, labour, housing and public works.

The East African Railways and Harbours Administration is a self-contained and self-financing service and it is proposed that the East African Posts and Telegraphs Departments should be converted into a self-contained Department with its own capital account in due course. The revenue of the High Commission, from which the other services administered by it are financed, is derived from contributions made by the three East African Governments, the Government of Zanzibar and certain other Governments for which services are performed, in agreed proportions, and by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom which makes substantial contributions to the Research and other Services from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. The whole of the expenditure is controlled by the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly which considers the annual estimates of Revenue and Expenditure of both the self-contained and the non-self-contained services.

**RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC SERVICES**

**Research Services**

The Research Services are arranged in five principal research organisations, to which others may be added in due course. The Director of each, while responsible to the High Commission, maintains close contact on the one hand with the respective specialist council or committee at the Colonial Office, and on the other with the Departments of Territorial Governments concerned in the subject. In each case headquarters of the organisation are being established at some convenient place and work is carried out wherever in East Africa it can be arranged with the greatest efficiency.

The following are the five organisations:

- **East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organisation** including *inter alia*, the former East African Agricultural Research Institute at Amani in Tanganyika; Fertiliser investigations in all Territories; Clove research in Zanzibar. New headquarters shared with the Veterinary Research Organisation are to be established within easy reach of Nairobi.

- **The East African Veterinary Research Organisation**. This organisation is responsible for most of the manufacture and supply of biological products for veterinary use in East Africa and elsewhere, as well as for research on animal diseases, animal husbandry and other aspects of the animal industry. At present its headquarters are at Kabete in Kenya.

- **The East African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Research and Reclamation Organisation** has three branches; Tsetse Research based on Shinyanga in Tanganyika, Trypanosomiasis Research at Tinde in Tanganyika, and Experimental Reclamation against tsetse fly with headquarters at Nairobi and sub-stations in the territories.

The East African Fisheries Research Organisation, which is limited at present to work on the fisheries of inland waters, and has headquarters at Jinja in Uganda.

The East African Industrial Research Board has headquarters in Nairobi and is at present concerned with research on secondary industries; but plans exist for establishing an East African Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation which will incorporate the Industrial Research Board and will have wider functions.

An East African Bureau of Medical Research will shortly be established.

**Scientific Services**

The Scientific Services include some research among their functions and are as follows:

- **The East African Statistical Department** has headquarters in Nairobi and branches are being established at the seats of Territorial Governments.

- **The East African Meteorological Department** also has headquarters at Nairobi. The Department maintains and studies climatological records in all parts of East Africa, and is responsible for weather forecasting for aeronautical and other purposes.

- **The Lake Victoria Fisheries Service** has headquarters at Mwanza in Tanganyika and is responsible for the development and control of the fisheries of Lake Victoria, which are shared by the three High Commission Territories.

- **The Desert Locust Survey** has headquarters in Nairobi, but maintains field units in Territories to the north of East Africa, keeping close watch and conducting investigations on the areas from which locust outbreaks may emanate.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Railways and Harbours**

By an Order made by the East Africa High Commission, established under the provisions of the East Africa (High Commission) Order in Council, 1947, with the approval of the Legislative Councils of the Colony of Kenya, the Protectorate of Uganda and the Trust Territory of Tanganyika, the two railway systems, formerly known as the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours and the Tanganyika Railways and Ports Services, were, with effect from the 1st May, 1948, amalgamated into one united system under the name of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration.

By a Proclamation issued by the Chairman of the High Commission, the East African Railways and Harbours Administration were, with effect from the same date, placed under the administration of the East Africa High Commission.

The powers, duties and functions of the High Commission in relation to the East Africa Railways and Harbours Administration are de facto exercised by the Commissioner for Transport with the advice of a Transport Advisory Council. The Commissioner for Transport is a Member of the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly and is Chairman of the Transport Advisory Council, which was created to advise him on questions of major policy. This Council consists of three Members appointed by the East Africa High Commission, and two Members appointed by each of the Governments of Kenya, Uganda...
and Tanganyika. There are separate Railway and Port Committees of the Transport Advisory Council.

(All figures are in respect of the year 1947).

**Air Services**

The East African Territories are served by a number of scheduled services, both on the main trunk routes and otherwise. The Springbok services and the B.O.A.C. York service to Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam, which may shortly give way to twice weekly Solent services to Lake Naivasha and Dar-es-Salaam, provide the bulk of the former, while Skyways and Air France services to Mauritius and Madagascar, Ethiopian Air Lines Dokata service to Addis Ababa, B.O.A.C. Dakota service from Aden to Nairobi, and Air Congo Dove service from Costermansville to Dar-es-Salaam, form the bulk of the remainder.

Regional scheduled services linking the Union of South Africa, the Rhodesias and East Africa, are operated by S.A.A. and C.A.A. with Vikings. A new service from Nairobi down the east coast through Portuguese East Africa to Durban is planned by East African Airways.

Several further scheduled services linking East Africa with India, Scandinavia and Italy are under consideration.

An internal network of scheduled services is operated by the East African Airways Corporation which employs Lodestar, Dove and Rapide aircraft.

The charter field is adequately covered by a comparatively large number of operators who are licensed, in some cases, for operation out of and into the Territories only, and in other cases for operation within the Territories in addition. The aircraft types available in this field range from the Lancastrians and Dakotas of Skyways (E.A.), Ltd., and the Freighter and Vikings of Airwork (E.A.), Ltd., to the smaller types such as Ansons, Rapides, Geminis, Austers and Pipers of the local companies.

Flying instruction, mostly on Piper Cubs and Cruisers, and, in the case of the Aero Club of East Africa on Tiger Moths, is available at several places, but is principally centred in Nairobi. The Kenya Government’s flying subsidy scheme, administered by the Aero Club of East Africa, has been re-started this year. It is open to would-be pilots of all races and in addition provides for flying practice for qualified pilots who would be available for R.A.F. duties in time of war.

Several operators of both medium and small aircraft are equipped for aerial survey work.
Maintenance facilities, particularly for the larger repairs and overhauls, have been scarce, but Airwork (E.A.), Ltd., have recently established a repair organisation at Nairobi which has largely overcome this shortage. A well equipped instrument repair shop has also been opened by Skyways (E.A.), Ltd.

Posts and Telegraphs

East Africa, comprising Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, is a member of the Universal Postal Union and contains 359 centres at which postal facilities are available, 158 of these being in Kenya, 143 in Tanganyika and 58 in Uganda.

Parcels dealt with numbered 816,446, and of this number 551,574 were dealt with in Kenya, 173,208 in Tanganyika, and 91,664 in Uganda.

An inland and foreign money order and telegraph money order service is available and British postal orders are issued and paid. There are regular air mail services between East Africa and Great Britain and between East Africa and South Africa and intermediate countries, with connections to all parts of the world.

Full information concerning postal and telegraph facilities is given in the East Africa Post Office Guide.

Telegraphs

The telegraph and telephone system has 48,997 miles of wire and all the important centres in the three Territories are connected by telegraph. The telegraph system is also linked via the Nyasaland and Rhodesia systems with the South African service. Communication with the Belgian Congo is maintained through Uganda with which the Belgian Congo system is linked.

Radio telegraph stations are operated by the Posts and Telegraphs Department as follows:

In Kenya—at Embu, Garissa, Isiolo, Kabarnet, Kitui, Lamu, Lodwar, Mandera, Maralal, Marsabit, Mombasa, Moyale, Nairobi and Wajir.
