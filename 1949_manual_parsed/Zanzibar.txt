ZANZIBAR

SITUATION AND AREA

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is 53 miles long by 24 broad (maximum measurements), and has an area of 640 square miles. To the north-east, at a distance of some 25 miles, lies the island of Pemba in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 42 miles long by 14 broad (maximum measurements), and having an area of 380 square miles.

CLIMATE

The islands of Zanzibar and Pemba are low lying, the highest land being little above 300 feet, and they lie in the path of the south-east and north-east monsoons. The average temperature is 80° F., the warmest months being January to March (82°–84° F.) and the coolest, June to September (75°–78° F.).

The average annual rainfall in Pemba varies from 65 inches in the north to 93 inches in the south, while in Zanzibar it varies from 48 inches to over 80 inches, the highest rainfall being in the centre of the island. There is no really dry season, but the rainy seasons are well marked, being in March to May at the start of the south-east monsoon and in November and December at the start of the north-east monsoon.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Arabs were the conquerors of the islands. They founded the clove industry and still possess considerable property in plantations. They understand the natives and the natives understand them and accept their control and that of Europeans more readily than that of other races.
The bulk of the native population numbering 200,000 is known by the generic name of Swahili, a term formerly used to denote the Bantu coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "sawahil" in Arabic meaning "coasts." This general appellation includes the descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar who intermarried with negro women. They are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern and southern portions of the islands. A quiet shy people, occupied mainly in the cultivation of native crops and fishing, they travel little except to pick cloves. The name Swahili also includes the descendants of the early settlers in Pemba who are known as Wapemba. These people engage chiefly in agriculture but raise a smaller variety of native crops than the Wahadimu. Many of them own clove and coconut plantations. They live in less seclusion than the natives on the larger island.

Another tribe included in the term are the Watumbatu, whose chief stronghold is Tumbatu Island. They are a very exclusive people but by no means shy. They are fishermen and sailors and man most of the native sailing craft plying in Zanzibar waters.

There is in addition a considerable influx of various tribes from the mainland, of whom the Wanyamwezi are economically the most important, being now the chief source of supply for the weeding of plantations.

In the 1948 census the total population of the protectorate was returned as 263,000. Of the non-African population of approximately 61,500 some 43,000 are Arabs. The Khoja, Bohora, Hindus and Goans possess most of the trade, either as merchants, shopkeepers, moneylenders, small traders or skilled artisans. Many Oman Arabs in the rural areas carry on small retail provision businesses and trade in produce.

**Population**

The population of the protectorate at the 1948 census was 263,000 (Zanzibar Island, 148,000; Pemba Island, 115,000).

The racial composition, in round figures, is as follows:

- Europeans: 300
- Arabs: 43,000
- Indians: 15,000
- Africans: 204,700

Total: 263,000

Zanzibar Island: 148,000
Pemba Island: 115,000

The population of the township of Zanzibar was returned at 44,359.

**Religion**

Islam is the predominant religion of this Arab State, and embraces approximately 252,000 of the population, both Arab, Africans, and Indians. Of the 11,000 odd non-Muslims, about 4,000 are Christians, about 3,500 Hindus, and about 3,500 are Parsis, Buddhists, and of other small categories, including a fair number of pagan African visitors from the mainland. The Christian communities include the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Church of England); the Society of the Holy Ghost (Roman Catholics), and the Friends' Industrial Mission (Society of Friends). The two former have their respective cathedrals.

**History**

The beginnings of Zanzibar history are lost in antiquity. It appears more than probable that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were known to the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Jews, but though the expedition of Necho (c. 600 B.C.) doubtless passed the islands it is not till the first century that the Periplus gives a description of one of them under the name of Menuthias. The Hindus appear to have settled at a very early date and traces of Greek colonisation are not lacking. From about the 7th century B.C. the islands appear to have had a close connection with the South Arabian states. Bantu settlers probably made their appearance during the first five centuries A.D., and thereafter, for the next 500 years or so, came also traders from China and Malaya, in addition to those from the Persian Gulf. The coast was probably converted to Islam early in the 10th century. The Zenj Empire was founded by Ali bin Hassan, a prince of Shiraz, about 975 A.D., but it soon broke up into separate states, and, by the time the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral, was already declining. It was during the 16th century that the Arabs of the east coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa fort in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the 17th century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856, a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar, the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by transferring his capital from Muscat and making the island his permanent residence in the year 1832. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially, the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "everybody as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognised by France and Germany, and they were declared a British protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10° 42' S. latitude, were ceded to Italy, Great Britain and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of £200,000. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of £144,000.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled,
and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the British Government assumed more direct control over the protectorate and reorganised the government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

The government was vested in a High Commissioner, who was also Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, and a British Resident. The High Commissionership was abolished in 1925.

A Protectorate Council, with His Highness as President, was established at the same time. It was of an advisory and consultative nature and ceased to exist in 1926 when Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted.

CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT

The government is administered by a British Resident, who is appointed by commission under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924.

The law of the protectorate consists of Orders-in-Council, the decrees of the Sultan, and certain Imperial statutes of general application. His Highness's decrees and legislation subsidiary thereto, when countersigned by the British Resident under Article 42 of the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are binding upon all persons. The Muhammadan Law is, by Section 7 of the Courts Decree (Cap. 3), declared to be the fundamental law of His Highness's dominions in civil matters.

There are Executive and Legislative Councils, established by the Councils Decree (Cap. 28, R.L.Z., 1934).

The existence of two sets of courts, comprising His Britannic Majesty's court and the court of His Highness the Sultan, and the courts subordinate thereto, respectively, has led to a form of "dual jurisdiction" in the protectorate which, although interesting from the historical point of view, has little practical bearing.

Justice, in cases in which persons subject to the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are concerned, is administered by H.B.M.'s High Court and the courts subordinate to it, and in other cases by H.H. the Sultan's Court for Zanzibar and the courts subordinate to that court. Subordinate courts are held by resident magistrates, administrative officers and Arab kathis. In addition, district courts, under the presidency of Arab administrative officers (mudirs), exercise a limited criminal and civil jurisdiction. An appeal lies from the British court and from the Zanzibar court in the exercise of their original civil and criminal jurisdiction to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa and thence to the Privy Council.

ADMINISTRATION

Throughout the modern history of Zanzibar the system of administration has been direct and still is so more or less, but the establishment of the first rural Local Councils with statutory sanctions in 1948 marks the initial step towards a less direct and more democratic method. There is a strong movement to convert the hitherto advisory urban councils of Zanzibar city into a Municipal Council with progressive executive responsibility for the public services of the township.

The official administrative framework is built up on African village headmen (54 in Pemba, 84 in Zanzibar) known as Shehas, whose areas (Shehias) are grouped into Mudirias (5 in each island excepting the town of Zanzibar). The Mudirs administering these (hitherto all Arabs) are responsible to the District Commissioners of their respective districts, Pemba and Zanzibar. To the latter are also posted Assistant District Officers, some of whom are European and some Arabs. All judicial work in Pemba is undertaken by Administrative Officers. The town of Zanzibar is a Mudiria in itself and the native quarter is subdivided into areas, each under an African headman responsible to the Mudir. Over the two Districts is the Senior Commissioner, who is responsible direct to Government.

The policy of Government is to entrust increasingly to His Highness's subjects the responsibility for the administration of their own affairs, as they show the desire and the ability to assume it.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

In the Protectorate there are Government Schools for the Arabs and Africans, and Grant-Aided Schools for Indians. In 1947 there were 41 Government Primary Schools with an enrolment of 3,989 boys, and 842 girls; while there were 13 Grant-Aided Schools with an enrolment of 1,867 boys and 1,419 girls.

In addition there is a Government Boys' Secondary School, and a Rural Middle School, with a total number of 370 boys in Secondary Standards. There is also a Government Girls' Secondary School with a roll of 53 girls.

Teachers for the Primary School are trained at the two Teacher Training Institutions, one for men and one for women, while post-secondary education for Arab and African students is provided at Makerere College, Uganda.

Scholarships are also provided for selected subjects of His Highness the Sultan to proceed to the United Kingdom, and for Indian students to proceed to India.

Mission Schools are run by the Roman Catholic Church, the U.M.C.A., and the Friends Mission. European children, on the other hand, usually attend schools on the mainland.

Information Service

Throughout the second world war, the Information service was conducted by the Education Department which handed over to the Administration in June, 1947. It is conducted by a small staff of three junior clerks, two announcers, and two drivers, under the direction of an Administrative Officer who fulfils the function of Information Officer. Its functions are the dissemination of daily news and news sheets in Kiswahili, the distribution of educative broadsheets of local significance, the transfer to clubs, libraries, and reading rooms of suitable literature, the display of pictures received from the Colonial Office, the operation of the mobile cinema and indoor shows in clubs, etc., liaison with the local press, and generally the fostering of good public relations. Shortage both of money and staff impose limitations upon the activity of this Service.
Health

There is one combined Government Hospital for Europeans, Africans and Asiatics in Zanzibar, with 173 beds, and two in Pemba. Apart from these, dispensary units are maintained in different parts of the rural districts and there is one Isolation Hospital where cases of contagious and infectious diseases are treated.

Anti-malarial measures are maintained in and around the town of Zanzibar.

Labour

The history of labour subsequent to 1897 is a tale of shortage, disinclination on the part of the labour available to engage in any form of settled work, inability or disinclination on the part of the Arabs to pay money wages, and administrative efforts to organise the available supply. The introduction of Indian labour was at one time or another canvassed but never materialised. In 1904 and 1906 and at other subsequent times recourse was had to recruitment of labour on the mainland.

In recent years recruitment of labour from outside the Protectorate has ceased and Zanzibar has become more dependent than formerly for its agricultural labour (particularly clove pickers) upon local natives, although mainlanders still come over voluntarily in considerable numbers in search of work and supply most of the paid plantation labour as well as that in the public works, public health, and agricultural departments of Government.

There is no labour department as such. All District Commissioners, Assistant District Officers and the Welfare Officer are Labour Officers under the Senior Commissioner. The Welfare Officer operates a small employment bureau and is the Registrar of Trade Unions, of which there are four, viz., the Wachukuzi Association, the Carpenters Association, the Europeans' Servants Union, and the Shop Assistants Association. Trade Unions are yet in their infancy, but backward as they are, the care spent on their guidance and instruction has not been unproductive. It is impossible to assess the extent of real unemployment in view of the casual nature of so much of the employment, and the ease with which the essential needs of life are satisfied with consequent temporary relapse of the urge to work.

Welfare

This service constitutes a section of the Provincial Administration, and comprises three Welfare Officers and four Assistant Welfare Officers (including one Arab lady). The two European Welfare Officers are Joint Secretaries of the Social Welfare Co-ordinating Committee and of the Zanzibar Voluntary Social Welfare Society. The activities of this section embrace probation, personal case work, discharged prisoners' aid, supervision of school attendance officers, special care of the blind, promotion of scouting and maintenance of clubs and women's meetings for needlework, reading, etc. The Resident Welfare Officer, an Arab, at the recently opened Civic Centre, presides over a non-European Committee of Management and watches over the various activities of the Centre. Begun strictly within Zanzibar town, welfare work is continually extending its range and content, and the staff is also expanding through the Voluntary Social Welfare Society, the cause of welfare receives great impetus from voluntary workers of all races, financially supported by a generous public and by a Government grant.

Communications

Roads

There are 206·00 miles of roads throughout the island of Zanzibar and 80·75 miles in Pemba suitable for motor traffic.

Shipping

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of transhipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast.

It possesses an excellent water supply, the best on the east coast of Africa. A considerable quantity is supplied to shipping annually.

Government steamers maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba and Dar-es-Salaam. Zanzibar has become a port of call in the itinerary of a number of large tourist steamers.

Coasting vessels carrying both passengers and cargo also maintain a regular service between Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika ports.

Air

An air service between Dar-es-Salaam and Nairobi, via Zanzibar, Tanga and Mombasa, is operated by East African Airways Corporation, and airmails are regularly despatched by this service for all overseas countries to connect with the British Overseas Airways Corporation Services.

Posts and Telegraphs

There are 5 post offices in the Protectorate where full postal business is transacted and 5 mudirial offices where the business is transacted on restricted basis.

Direct money orders and parcels services have been established with more important countries of the Postal Union. Surface mails are regularly conveyed by steamers of British India, Union Castle Lines, etc. Regular weekly mails are conveyed between Zanzibar, Pemba and Dar-es-Salaam by Zanzibar Government steamers.

The Government wireless stations for the exchange of wireless telegrams between Zanzibar and Pemba and between Zanzibar and ships have been taken over by the Cable and Wireless who now operate these services.

Cable & Wireless, Ltd., owns and operates the cable station whence telegraphic communication is maintained via Aden, via Seychelles, via Durban, via Mombasa, via Dar-es-Salaam, with all parts of the world through the company's system.

There are nine savings bank offices on the two islands.

With effect from 0100 hours on the 1st January, 1948, East African Zone Time of G.M.T. plus three hours instead of East African Standard Time of G.M.T. plus 2½ hours was adopted by Zanzibar.

- Clove Duty £97,538,
- Licences, etc., £53,936,
- Colonial Development and Welfare Grants £56,426 and Fees of Court, etc., £90,225.

The principal sources of taxation are Customs Import Duties (£276,738 in 1947), Clove Duty (£97,538 in 1947) and Income Tax (£21,900 in 1947). There is no Poll or Hut Tax or other important source of direct or indirect taxation.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

The standard coin of the protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage:

- 50 cts. (silver) and 10 cts., 5 cts., 1 ct. (bronze).

East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon. The amount in circulation at 31st December, 1946, was notes £442,140 and coin £239,233.

Two British banks maintain branches in the territory:—The National Bank of India, Ltd. and the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd.—both at Zanzibar.

There is also one private Indian banking firm, Messrs. Jetha Lila.

There are no agricultural co-operative societies and the Clove Growers Association provides finance for agriculturists, granting short and long term loans; the system of chattel mortgages is used extensively.

There is a Government Savings Bank with 11,045 depositors at the end of 1946 and total deposits of £270,095.

**PRODUCTION AND TRADE**

The protectorate of Zanzibar is still the dominant partner in the clove industry, holding as it does the greater part of the shares. The other partners are Madagascar and the Dutch East Indies, with Penang a very small shareholder.

Authorities differ as to the date when and the country from which the clove tree was first introduced into Zanzibar. Some say that it was brought from Réunion by an Arab at the end of the 18th century. Colonel Rigby, Her Majesty’s Consul and British Agent, in his report on the Zanzibar dominions written in the year 1860, states “the first clove trees were introduced about 30 years ago from Mauritius; being found to thrive they were extensively planted and they have now become the most valuable production of these islands.”

To Seyyid Said belongs the credit of establishing and promoting the clove industry. Burton records that he threatened confiscation to those who did not plant three clove trees for every coconut and that the country was almost denuded of the latter to make room for cloves. In 1839–40 the output amounted to about fraslias 9,000. (The frasilà, equivalent to 35 lb., is the local measure of weight for cloves.) In 1849 it had risen to fraslias 120,000. In 1859 fraslias 139,000, valued at £53,666, were exported, and the average output during the next decade was fraslias 200,000, valued at about £85,000. Owing to the increase in production the price had, however, fallen from $5–$6 to $1–$2.

In 1872 a hurricane of great violence swept over the island of Zanzibar and destroyed two-thirds of the clove and coconut trees. Pemba, though touched by the hurricane, sustained little damage. The years following this disaster were years of short supply, high prices, and intensive cultivation. The Pemba owners, actuated by motives of gain, hastened to cut down coconut trees on a wholesale scale throughout the island and to plant clove trees in their place. The Zanzibar owners, though temporarily ruined, set to work with commendable fortitude to replace the trees which the hurricane had destroyed, and 10 years after the hurricane the normal output of cloves had not only been restored but increased.

Another event of great economic importance to the industry was the abolition of slavery. The industry was built up and for many years sustained on slave labour imported from the interior of Africa. In 1873 Seyyid Bargash entered into a treaty to suppress the sea-borne traffic in slaves and to close all public markets in his dominions for the buying or selling of imported slaves. Various treaties and legislative measures followed until the year 1897, when by a decree of Seyyid Hamoud the legal status of slavery was abolished. It may be noted parenthetically that in the year 1890 Great Britain assumed a protectorate over Zanzibar.

Since the abolition of slavery the event of major economic importance has been the settlement by Government of agricultural indebtedness.

There has been a significant and satisfactory price stability in the clove industry since marketing was placed on a managed basis.

Production has been well maintained, and, despite fluctuating exports owing to shortage of shipping during the war years, there has been no difficulty in disposing of stocks. Exports for 1946 were 310,258 cwts., valued at £1,159,322.

The distillation of clove oil has expanded considerably. The exports during 1938 were 235,518 lb., valued at £24,366 compared with 410,677 lb., valued at £83,784 for 1946.

The Clove Growers’ Association, established in 1927 and incorporated by decree in 1934, assists in stabilising the price of cloves, and distills and markets clove oil.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 57,000 acres under cultivation and four million trees in both islands. The export of domestic copra in 1946 amounted to 8,035 tons, valued at £204,113, and in addition other coconut
products to the value of £81,132 were exported. Much is produced by the small grower or trader neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Ceylon.

Cloves, mangrove bark and chillies are examined and graded prior to export under the Agricultural Produce Export Decree. The quality of copra is controlled as far as possible under the Adulteration of Produce Decree.

The quality of coconut oil is controlled under the Agricultural Produce Export Decree as from the 1st October, 1948.

There is a general ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. on imported goods, with the exception of certain articles which have either a specific duty or a higher ad valorem duty, such as spirits, motor spirit, kerosene, cigarettes, tobacco, matches, tea, cotton and artificial silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, boots and shoes, etc. There is also a schedule of articles exempt from duty. The tariff includes no provisions for Empire preference.

The main industry of the protectorate is the production of cloves of which it furnishes the major part of the requirements of the world. Clove oil, extracted mainly from stems, is also exported. Other normal exports (including re-exports of imported goods) are copra, coconut oil, oil cake, soap, mangrove bark, fresh fruit, millet, ivory, textiles and petroleum products. There are oil seed crushing plants and soap factories, but the country is predominantly agricultural.

There are approximately 21,000 head of cattle in Pemba island and 15,000 in Zanzibar. Pemba is self-supporting as regards meat supplies.

Principal articles of import are rice and grain, textiles, motor spirit and petroleum, sugar, tobacco and cigarettes, flour, ghee, sesame, cattle, dried fish, jute-bags and sacks and straw bags.

The following table shows the percentage of the total value of imports from and exports to the various countries of origin and destination during 1947:
