**SINGAPORE**

**Situation and Area**

Singapore Island is situated off the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula to which it is joined by a causeway carrying a road and railway. The straits between the island and mainland are about three-quarters of a mile wide. The island is some 27 miles in length, 14 miles in breadth, and about 217 square miles in area (including the adjacent islets). The town of Singapore is situated on the southern side of the island, in latitude 1° 17' N., and longitude 103° 50' E.

Christmas Island is situated in the Indian Ocean about 190 miles south of the western extremity of Java, in latitude 10° 30' S., and longitude 105° 40' E. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 60 square miles, and contains extensive deposits of phosphate of lime which are worked and exported.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, a group of 27 small coral islands about 700 miles south-west of Batavia lie (except for North Island) between latitude 12° 4' to 12° 13' S., and longitude 96° 49' to 96° 56' E. The largest is five miles long and one-fourth mile wide. Only two, "Home" and "Direction" Islands, have important settlements, the latter being inhabited by the staff of Cable and Wireless, which maintains a station there. On West Island there is an air-strip which played an important part in communications during the war with Japan (the Cocos Islands, unlike the rest of the colony, were never occupied by the Japanese) and in which interest is again being shown as a link in an Australian-S. African air route. Home Island houses the labour force for working the large coconut plantations on the islands. The only export is copra.

**Climate**

The climate of Singapore is characterised by uniform temperature, high humidity and copious rainfall. The variation of temperature throughout the year is very small and the excessively high temperatures of continental tropical areas are never experienced. The average maximum temperature for the whole year is 86° F. and the average minimum temperature 75° F. The average for any one month does not vary from the annual mean by more than 2° F.

There are no well-marked dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year. Records for a number of years show that the average annual rainfall is 95 inches. December is the wettest month with a little over 10 inches, while February, May, June, July and September are dry months, with between 6½ and 7 inches. Rain falls on the average on one day in two.

The wettest year on record is 1913 with 135·92 inches, and the driest year, 1888, with 63·21 inches. Prevailing winds are southerly from May to October and northerly from November to April.

The year 1947 was on the whole a wet one with 111 inches of rain against a normal of 95 inches. March was the wettest month with some 16 inches of rain; more than twice the normal fall for this month. July was the driest month with 3½ inches of rain.

Temperatures were normal. The highest temperature 93° F. was recorded on 25th April and again on 21st July.

**General Description**

The island, which is roughly diamond-shaped, but broken by long inlets, has no outstanding natural features. The highest point is Bukit Timah Hill (581 feet). The only large stretches of inland water are the McRitchie, Peirce and Seletar Reservoirs. The island is fringed on the west with mangrove swamps. To the east there are stretches of low cliff; good bathing beaches are few. The adjacent islands forming part of the colony include Blakang Mati and St. John's Island which are used for Government purposes and Pulau Brani and Pulau Bukum on which there are commercial installations. The rest are mainly inhabited by fishermen. The soil is predominantly red laterite and clay and not easily worked, though intensive market-garden culture is carried on by the Chinese in the more fertile valleys. There is only one small stretch of rice cultivation.

Singapore is primarily a commercial and strategic centre. It is the chief port for the produce of the Malay peninsula, the chief entrepot centre for south-east Asia and the Netherlands East Indies, and a focus for air and sea transport. There are also a number of secondary, processing and assembly industries. Tin smelting, the manufacture of rubber goods, rattan works, saw-mills, brick works, paints, and the canning of locally-grown pineapples are the more important of these; products of secondary importance are beer, biscuits, soap, coconut-oil, ground-nut, furniture, asbestos packings, aluminium manufactures, etc.; but the prosperity of the colony mainly depends on the productivity and volume of trade of the surrounding territories.

**Population**

The preliminary figures of the 1947 census gave the Colony's population as 938,079, a 68 per cent. increase on the 1931 Census figures. The group totals for 1947 are these:

- 727,863 (77·6 per cent.) Chinese,
- 114,654 (12·2 per cent.) Malays,
- 71,289 (7·6 per cent.) Indians and
- 8,718 (0·9 per cent.) Europeans.

While in 1931 there were 584 females for every 1,000 males, there were 819 in 1947.

**Religion**

The larger Christian communities represented in Singapore are the Church of England, the Roman Catholic, the Presbyterian, the Methodist and Salvation Army. The Anglican Bishop of Singapore, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Malacca, the Methodist (U.S.) Bishop have their headquarters in Singapore.
A variety of beliefs is found amongst the Chinese population including Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism.

The Malays and a minority of the Indians are Muslims, whose religious interests are watched through the Muslim Advisory Board.

The majority of the Indians, being Tamils from South India, are Hindus. They have four principal temples, three controlled by the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowment Board, the fourth by the Chettiar community.

**History**

The original city of Singapore (Lion City), said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra, came into prominence in the fourteenth century. From about 1377 when it was sacked by the Javanese Majapahit Empire, till 1818, there was only an insignificant fishing village on the site. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles was commissioned by the Governor-General of India, Lord Hastings, to establish a trading station in Rhio or Johore. His choice fell on Singapore Island and on 6th February he signed an agreement with the Sultan which gave the British the right to erect factories in any part of the Sultan’s realm, while no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. Suitable payment was arranged in exchange. The Dutch at first objected to this action by the British in an area which they had hitherto regarded as being in their control, but by the Treaty of London signed in 1824, all outstanding territorial differences between the two powers were settled and in the same year the Sultan of Johore ceded the island in full sovereignty and property to the East India Company.

In January, when Raffles landed in Singapore, it was little more than a derelict native village—its ancient fame a half-forgotten story—with a handful of inhabitants and practically no trade. But the native traders quickly discovered the advantages of a post so central and so free from Dutch restrictions. With trade came people. “Already,” wrote Raffles in June, “a population of above 3,000 souls has collected under our flag.” In 1824 that number had at least been doubled, and 35,000 tons of shipping used the port. In 1835, the population was 30,000 and the tonnage 200,000.

In the succeeding years the phenomenal progress of his creation showed no sign of diminution. The trade figures were £2,610,440 in 1825, £13,252,175 in 1864. The population which at the first census in 1824 numbered 10,683 had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister settlements of Malacca and Penang with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements had been put under the presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. However, since the abolition of the Company’s monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India was no longer interested in the Straits; it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. Although the transfer was agreed in principle in 1860 it was not until 10th August, 1866, that an act was passed to transfer the control of the Straits Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. On 1st April, 1867 the transfer was formally effected and the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

In the development of the Malayan hinterland Singapore played a primary part and in the resultant prosperity she had her share. It was in Singapore that European processes of tin smelting were introduced in 1887 with the result that in 1939 Singapore smelted more tin than England and Holland combined. It was in Singapore and in Perak that Hevea Brasiliensis was successfully cultivated in 1877; it was the Director of Singapore’s Botanical Gardens, Mr. Ridley, who in 1891, first exhibited cultivated rubber to the public, and though Singapore grew little rubber itself, it became the chief rubber export centre of the world, and in 1918 out of a total trade of $152,229,753 the value of rubber exported was $153,455,920. Population followed prosperity in a continuous upward curve; a century after Raffles’ landing the population within the municipal limits was estimated at 305,000, in 1931 it was 599,946, of whom 74·9 per cent were Chinese.

**Constitution and Administration**

Prior to the loss of Malaya to the Japanese in February, 1942, the Settlement of Singapore together with the Settlements of Penang and Malacca and Labuan formed the Colony of the Straits Settlements. On the re-occupation of Malaya, Singapore and the Malay Peninsula were administered by separate branches of British military administration, but on 1st April, 1946, on the re-introduction of civil government, Singapore became a separate Crown Colony by Order in Council, and at the same time the administration of the Settlements of Malacca and Penang were included in the Malayan Union. The Order in Council made further provision for the separation from the Colony of the Territory of Labuan, which continued under military administration for the time being. The separation took place on 10th July, 1946. Co-ordination between the governments in matters of common interest was ensured by the appointment of a Governor-General. On the departure of Lord Killearn, who had been Special Commissioner for S.E. Asia, his work was amalgamated with that of the Governor-General under the new title of Commissioner-General for S.E. Asia. The new appointment carries on the former advisory and co-ordinating role of the Governor-General. Colonial Office statements and the white paper (Cmd. 7171) on the Federation of Malaya envisage the possibility of the eventual inclusion of Singapore within the Malayan Federation.

**Form of Government**

On 1st April, 1948, the first Legislative Council for the Colony of Singapore was sworn in and the period of the Advisory Council which had operated since the return of civil government on 1st April, 1946, came to an end. The first elections had taken place successfully on 20th March with 76 per cent. of the 22,387 registered voters casting their votes. Of the 6 elected from territorial constituencies by a predominantly Asia electorate, one was an Englishman.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor as President (with an original and a casting vote); 4 ex-officio members (the Colonial and Financial Secretaries, the Attorney-General, and the President of the Municipal Commissioners); 5 nominated officials; 3 elected severally by the
Singapore, Chinese, and Indian Chambers of Commerce: 6 elected in 2 two-member and 2 one-member territorial constituencies by universal suffrage of all British subjects over 21 on the annually-revised electoral register; and 4 nominated unofficials. The Council thus has an unofficial majority.

The affairs of the Municipal area of 31 square miles—chiefly public utilities, public health, roads and sewage—are run by a body of 24 nominated Municipal Commissioners under a member of the M.C.S. as President. It raises its own funds from rates. The parallel body for the Rural areas and the islands is the Rural Board under the Chairmanship of a member of the M.C.S. (at present the Commissioner of Lands) and consisting of 4 officials and 6 nominated unofficials. It has not the same status as the Municipal Commissioners either in status or in finances.

Justice

The Courts Ordinance (Chapter 10) provides for the following courts for the administration of civil and criminal law:

(a) The Supreme Court;
(b) District Courts;
(c) Police Courts;
(d) Coroners' Courts.

The Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance (Chapter 11) provides for appeals from convictions in trial at assizes.

The Supreme Court is composed of the Chief Justice and three or more Puisne Judges. It is a court of record, and consists of:

(a) The High Court which exercises original criminal and civil jurisdiction, and appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction in cases tried in district and police courts; and

(b) the Court of Appeal which exercises appellate civil jurisdiction in cases tried in the High Court.

An appeal lies from the Court of Appeal and from the Court of Criminal Appeal by leave to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

Criminal trials at assizes are held before a judge sitting with a jury of seven persons.

Normally there are two District Courts in the Colony of Singapore, one for civil and the other for criminal cases. To cope with the large increase of criminal cases, four additional District Courts have been established. The civil jurisdiction of a District Court is limited to suits involving not more than $500 when a district judge presides, and not more than $100 when an assistant district judge presides.

There are at present eleven police courts in the colony, the Governor having power to constitute as many police courts as he thinks fit. The jurisdiction of the police courts is regulated by the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 21) but certain additional powers and duties are conferred upon them by other ordinances.

There is also a Coroner's Court; a Coroner is appointed by the Governor either for the whole colony or for a district thereof.

The Courts Ordinance provides also for the appointment of Justices of the Peace. Justices of the Peace have no power to try cases.

The criminal procedure of the colony is governed by the Criminal Procedure Code while civil procedure is governed by rules of court made under the Courts Ordinance.

Civil procedure in the Supreme Court is governed by rules of the Supreme Court, and civil procedure in the District Courts is governed by District Court rules.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

During 1948 post-war rehabilitation has been almost fully completed, and a good start made in implementing the 10-year programme of educational reconstruction and expansion. Free primary education has been widely extended and enrolment in registered schools has reached the 100,000 mark.

Education in the English tongue is provided from primary classes upward by Government in 15 schools, by Mission bodies in 16 schools with financial aid from Government, and privately in 48 schools without grants. These schools are open to, and attended by, pupils of all races, and, as is to be expected in Singapore, a high proportion of the pupils is Chinese. In addition there are over 200 Chinese and 46 Indian vernacular schools, many of which receive a Government grant, and 36 Malay free schools maintained entirely by Government. All schools are subject to registration and inspection. A Junior Technical School and an Aided Trade School (Mission) provide vocational education. Adult evening classes (enrolment circ. 1,600 annually) are held in a variety of subjects, English, Commercial, Technical and Marine.

Higher education is provided at Raffles College and the King Edward VII College of Medicine. These are shortly to merge and form the nucleus of a new University of Malaya sited on the Straits of Johore.

Shortages of accommodation are gradually being made up by the erection of new schools; more afternoon schools have been opened; furniture, science equipment and text-books are more readily available than they were a year ago. There are now 240 additional teachers in training. Chinese and Indian vernacular schools are being brought under more efficient control by an increasingly generous system of grants-in-aid.

Information Services

The Public Relations Office is a part of the Secretariat organisation under a Public Relations Secretary. He is therefore kept in close touch both with policy and central administration and is in a central position from which to keep in touch with Departments. By personal contacts, Press Conferences and Press Releases the office keeps in close touch with the Press both local and overseas. Singapore remains the Press capital of Malaya, and apart from Reuters, U.P. and A.P., U.K. papers have full-time correspondents based on Singapore. Many foreign correspondents pass through Singapore. The vernacular Press is monitored daily.

In addition the office operates a film unit, and two public address vans, maintains 30 photo stations and 10 poster hoardings, prints in four languages and distributes posters, pamphlets and leaflets, organises exhibitions, lecture courses, and special campaign, e.g. "Safety First".

Department of Broadcasting.—This is a pan-Malayan Department which broadcasts in English, Malay, Chinese (8 dialects) and Tamil. At the end of 1947, 11,700 licences had been issued in Singapore. Three transmitters operate in Singapore where the H.Q. is situated. The Department broadcasts regular news bulletins
and talks, as well as entertainment in the form of classical, light and dance music and drama. Outside broadcasts are given of events of public and sporting interest.

Schools broadcasts are a successfully established part of the programme. They average 9 hours a week with 27 different programmes in English, Malay and Mandarin. At the end of 1947, 28 English, 7 Malay and 29 Chinese schools in Singapore were using the programmes.

British Council.—The British Council have now established an office in Singapore. In September, 1948, a former school building with a hall and office accommodation was opened as a British Council centre.

Health

The Government Medical Department provides hospital accommodation totalling 3,400 beds including the Mental Hospital. Of these only 1,200 are available for the treatment of acute illness. In addition, for the rural population there are two static dispensaries and three travelling dispensaries. There is a medical school at the King Edward VII College of Medicine where the registrable qualification of L.M.S., Singapore can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the L.D.S. (Licenciate in Dental Surgery), Diploma of Pharmacy and for the Diploma of the Royal Sanitary Institute.

Considering the leeway to be made up after the years of Japanese occupation, the health of the population of Singapore during 1947 was remarkably satisfactory. For the year 1947, the birth-rate was 45·89 per mille, death-rate 13·34 per mille and infant-mortality-rate 87·33 per mille. The two latter constitute a low record. Tuberculosis was the disease causing most concern and much thought and attention was directed to the steps to be taken to combat this disease. Shortage of trained staff and staff accommodation have seriously handicapped the work of the department since the re-occupation and thus limited expansion of various much needed medical services. Much preventive work has been done in such directions as the restoration of anti-malarial drainage works, and the inspection of shipping, which is of great importance in Singapore, a great port lying among countries which have in the last few years all been subject to grave increases in infectious diseases. It says much for the vigilance of the health services that there has been no serious epidemic in Singapore traceable to this source.

Maternity and child-welfare centres are established in various parts of the island, and weekly clinics are also held in adapted buildings. The local population has fully realised the value of this service, and has offered to collect funds to build three new centres. Over 80,000 attendances by children are recorded in a year.

Another important service in this direction is the free distribution of dried milk to expectant and nursing mothers and to children up to the age of four.

Full information regarding health medical work is to be found in the 1947 Annual Report of the Colony's Medical Department.

Labour

Singapore differs from many other Colonial territories in that it is not a primary producing area, and is largely industrialised. Over 3,000 places of employment are known to the Labour Department and in these places more than 60,000 labourers are at work. In addition, 40,500 are employed by the Government, the Singapore Harbour Board, the Municipality and the three Services (Navy, Army and R.A.F.). There are more than 100 varieties of industry represented in those places of employment and necessarily a great many more varieties of occupation.

Chief among them may be mentioned industries connected with rubber—smoking, milling, packing for export, and manufacture of rubber goods, in which 88 undertakings provide occupation for more than 6,000.

Engineering works lead amongst skilled occupations with 3,000 workmen in 142 places of employment. Furniture manufacture employs just over 1,000 and oil mills give work to the same number. Petroleum products, which include the big oil companies such as Shell and Standard Vacuum, employ 2,000; printing, just over 1,000.

There are 2,300 persons employed on stevedoring apart from those in the Singapore Harbour Board. Lighterage gives work to 1,800 and general labour to 5,800.

Wage rates in commercial undertakings have generally remained stationary throughout 1947 with occasional tendencies to fall. As yet there has been little standardization of wages in Singapore.

The output of the individual in Singapore is far below that of any workman in a similar occupation in England. This is partly due to the climate but is also largely due to the absence of mechanization—a fact now forced upon the employers' notice by high labour costs.

The normal working day is eight hours though the law still permits a maximum of nine. Six days work per week is the general practice in larger places of employment.

Extra rates are paid for overtime work, usually one and a half times the ordinary rate rising to double rates if prolonged. Work done on Sundays or public holidays is usually paid for at double rates.

When industrial disputes occur or are threatened the Labour Department makes every effort to promote conciliatory discussions between the parties and attempts to get the two sides to effect a settlement themselves.

Machinery exists for the settlement of disputes by legally established Arbitration Boards or by Industrial Courts should the parties so wish. Submission of a dispute to either of these bodies must be by mutual consent of both parties and only if direct negotiations are unsuccessful. No compulsory powers exist for the settlement of any trade disputes nor are such thought desirable. No recourse was had to Industrial Courts or Arbitration Boards during the year, but the strike of the Singapore Traction Company employees was settled after an enquiry had been held into the dispute by a judge of the High Court acting under a commission from His Excellency the Governor and appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance.

Trade unions now usually represent the workers in negotiations in any trade dispute.

From 1st July, 1947, the Registrar of Trade Unions Department became part of the Labour Department. By the end of the year 163 unions had been registered and this is believed to be all the existing unions.
Advisory work to employers, and employees, is another function. Other activities include enforcement of the proper observance of the Labour Ordinance and the Machinery Ordinance; administration of the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance and of certain parts of the Children's Ordinance; the operation of an Employment Exchange; repatriation of Indian labourers, and payment of gratuities and other monies to them. To carry out these duties there is provision for a staff of 13 administrative and executive officers though several of these posts remained vacant throughout the year.

A notable feature of the year's activities was the attendance at the Regional Conference of the International Labour Organization in New Delhi of a full delegation from Singapore.

Although little legislation dealing with labour matters was enacted, a great deal of work was done on the preparation of a new Labour Ordinance, to replace the existing one which is somewhat out of date, on a Factories Ordinance, and on revision of the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance. Shortage of staff retarded this work which would otherwise have been completed by the end of the year.

A Labour Advisory Board for the Colony was set up in March, under the chairmanship of the Commissioner for Labour. It is tripartite in composition, there being three representatives each of Government, employers and workers. Its terms of reference are: "To consider and make recommendations on any aspect of labour, or any matters concerning labour which may seem proper to the Board or which may be referred to the Board". Twelve meetings were held during the year.

Welfare

The development of the Department of Social Welfare is perhaps one the most outstanding features of post-war Singapore. Formed in June, 1946, this Department was inevitably preoccupied in its earliest days with relieving the confusion and distress which prevailed as a result of the Japanese occupation. Since that time it has shed many of these temporary activities and has assumed other functions of a more permanent and progressive nature.

The primary function of the Department is to act as a co-ordinating agency between the various voluntary bodies as well as those departments of government whose activities impinge upon the field of social welfare. The medium by which this is carried out is the Social Welfare Council consisting of representatives of the most prominent voluntary bodies including the Churches as well as the heads of the departments of Education, Medicine, Labour, and Co-operation.

The Department is the body which exercises statutory functions under the Women and Girls Ordinance. For this purpose it co-operates with the Police, the Immigration Department, and the Medical Department, carrying out raids on notorious premises, screening all female immigrants, conducting prosecutions, and maintaining a large number of girls in two institutions.

The Department has drafted comprehensive legislation setting up a Juvenile Court, a Probation System and Approved Schools, as well as providing for the care and protection of children, rules for their employment and regulations for the registration of children transferred out of the custody of their parents.

A separate court has for some time been carrying out the functions of a Juvenile Court, and local Probation Officers operating under the advice of two trained Probation Officers from England are already setting up the framework of a probation system. An Approved School is operating on the most up-to-date lines.

The Department administers a system of public assistance and also acts as the agency whereby several public funds are distributed in relief. An advice service is in existence to help individuals in such matters as making claims, settling disputes, and tracing relatives.

The Department administers a system of free feeding for children suffering from malnutrition. Twenty-three Children's Feeding Centres have been opened and about half of these have developed into Social Centres where medical attention, advice, recreation, and informal instruction are given, largely through the agency of a body of voluntary workers comprising ladies of all the races resident in Singapore.

A Social Survey of Singapore was carried out in December, 1947, and in the Report, which was completed in 1948, a broad outline was shown of social conditions giving valuable indications both as to the direction in which further social welfare work should develop and also as to lines of future investigation.

COMMUNICATIONS

Railways

Railways in Malaya are operated by the Malayan Railways which has its biggest station near the docks in Singapore for the convenience of passengers travelling by sea.

Apart from railways within the Harbour Board area, there is only one stretch of railway on the island, that running to the Johore causeway and the Malayan Peninsula.

Shipping

Singapore harbour is practically land-locked. Its port limits cover an area of 36½ square miles, consisting of the inner harbour protected from the north-east monsoon by a mile-long granite rubble mole, the outer harbour and the western anchorage. Responsibility for the piloting, buoying and lighting of the port lie with the Government through the Master Attendant. There are efficient lighterage services to ships in the harbour.

Public wharves and dry docks which cover over 690 acres are controlled by the Singapore Harbour Board appointed by the Government. By-laws and rules and charges are made by the Board subject to the approval of the Governor-in-Council.

Shipping and Port Facilities

During the year 1947, the volume of cargo handled was approximately 2,560,000 deadweight tons, of which 1,512,000 tons were handled over the Harbour Board wharves, the balance being handled in the roads. This gives a daily average of 7,500 tons. The volume of cargo handled over the Harbour Board wharves was slightly higher than the figure for 1946 and was, in fact, the highest on record for any year of peace except 1938. The approximate number of ships handled by the Singapore Harbour Board in the year 1947 was 1,700 and their approximate net registered tonnage was 4,943,552. Delays to shipping waiting for berths were greatly reduced in 1947, and the average time for which ships were kept waiting for berths amounted during the
year to less than a day. The improvement arose partly from the great progress which had already been made in 1946 towards restoring the bombed transit sheds and partly from steady progress during 1947 in restoring the organisation and administration at the port.

In spite of constant difficulties in obtaining materials, the restoration of the Harbour Board's facilities proceeded. Warehouse space was increased by 350,000 sq. ft. and 5 miles of road were reconstructed. Along the quays 75,000 sq. ft. of new surface were laid and 3,000 lineal feet of quay-fenders were renewed. In addition to minor repairs throughout the Harbour Board railway system, 3½ miles of railway were entirely re-laid. By the end of the year the greater part of the dredging programme, necessitated by years of Japanese neglect, had been completed; 1¼ miles of sea frontage having been dredged to normal depth.

An interesting feature of the year's work was the completion of two new installations for storing and shipping latex.

The Harbour Board's shipyards worked to their full capacity during the year. In addition to many major repairs to ocean-going ships, several reconstructions of local steamers were completed and three locally owned dredgers were refitted. The addition of new machinery steadily increased efficiency in the dockyards during the year, and a large office and store was completed in replacement of the dockyard office and store which had been totally destroyed by bombing.

The year opened with a grave inheritance from 1946 of looting and pilferage. To meet the situation a force of Auxiliary Police Officers was raised. By the middle of the year this Force had the situation under control and on the Board's wharves looting came to an end and pilferage was reduced to a level comparing well with any other major port in the world.

The Buoyage and Lights controlled by the Marine Department of the Colony are now fully re-established and a Marine Department launch has been fitted for providing a Wireless Direction finding calibration service for the checking of ships' finding gear.

Air

Singapore has two major airfields; Tengah (Runway 2,000 yards) and Kallang (Runway 1,750 yards). Kallang is operated by the Pan-Malayan Department of Civil Aviation. Tengah is operated by the R.A.F. Tengah, however, is used by civil airlines for their heavier aircraft, and it is proposed to reconstruct it as a joint user international airport. A third aerodrome, Changi, is under reconstruction for the R.A.F.

The following airlines operate from and through Singapore:

- The B.O.A.C./Qantas, "Kangaroo" route from the U.K. to Australia, operates a Constellation service, thrice weekly; an express Lancastrian service, mainly for the transportation of air freight, and a Hythe flying boat service. The K.L.M. line from Amsterdam to Batavia also operate with Constellations. K.L.M. also link Singapore with Indonesian territory. R.A.F. Transport Command operate a weekly service to Kuching (Sarawak), Labuan and Jesselton (North Borneo) with flying boats and a York service from the U.K. via Ceylon. A weekly service between Ceylon and Singapore is also operated by B.O.A.C.

Air travel facilities to China are provided by B.O.A.C. to Hong Kong, and Cathay Pacific operates a service to Hong Kong via Bangkok. C.N.A.C. operate a line from Shanghai to Singapore via Hong Kong and Bangkok. Direct service to Manila is expected in the near future.

Malayan Airways, Ltd., operate internal air services throughout Malaya, providing links with Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Alor Star, Penang, Kota Bharu and Kuantan.

This company also maintains services with Saigon, Bangkok, Batavia, and other points in Indonesia. In the future this Company will also provide a regular service to points in Sarawak and North Borneo.

Posts and Telegraphs

The Postal Services Department of the Colony of Singapore under the Controller of Posts, Singapore, forms part of the Postal Administration of Malaya administered by the Postmaster-General, Malaya, with headquarters at Kuala Lumpur.

All types of postal business are conducted at the General Post Office and at 18 other Post Offices on the island. The Post Office Savings Bank operates at all these offices and the amount of deposits is steadily increasing. Deliveries by postmen are made to all parts of the island and at the General Post Office there are also private boxes and a window delivery service.

The outlets for surface mails are gradually improving both in frequency and reliability and the average time of transit from Singapore to England is 30 days. Air mail services to all parts of the world are available and a reliable internal air service also operates daily.

A new series of postage stamps to replace the former Straits Settlements stamps overprinted "B.M.A." was placed on sale in October, 1948.

The telephone system is operated by the Oriental Telephone Exchange Company. There are telephone and telegraph connections to all parts of Malaya through the pan-Malayan telecommunications department, which also operates a teleprinter service between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Cable & Wireless operate cable services for overseas, except that for British Borneo which is operated by the telecommunications department.

Public Finance

Public Revenue in 1947 was $70,972,949.00 and expenditure was $61,956,004.34. The revised estimate of revenue for 1948 is $91,242,164, and the revised estimate of expenditure is $90,201,764.

The chief sources of revenue in the approved estimates of 1948 were as follows:

| Source                  | Amount     |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Income Tax              | 25,000,000 |
| Tax on liquors          | 10,800,000 |
| Petrol Tax              | 8,000,000  |
| Tobacco Duties          | 20,000,000 |
| Entertainment Duties    | 3,000,000  |

Singapore is a free port. There are therefore no tariffs, except from the duties on spirits, tobacco and petrol.

The chief items of expenditure in the 1948 estimate were as follows:

| Item                     | Amount     |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Public Debt Expenditure  | 8,092,857  |
| Civil Aviation           | 1,104,429  |
| Education                | 3,112,292  |
| Medical                  | 8,239,466  |
| Military                 | 2,954,564  |
| Police                   | 7,012,656  |
| Public Works             | 3,694,457  |
| Social Welfare           | 1,234,092  |
Currency and Banking

The following banks operate in Singapore, and form the Malayan Exchange Banks Association:

- The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.
- The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation.
- The Mercantile Bank of India, Ltd.
- The Eastern Bank, Ltd.

External Trade

In 1947 Singapore's imports reached the value of $1,045,772,475 (76.5 per cent. of the Pan-Malayan figure). The exports reached the value of $812,983,413 (62.7 per cent. of the Pan-Malayan figure). The total value was therefore $1,858,755,888—69.8 per cent. of the Pan-Malayan figure. (These figures represent merchandise and exclude parcel post, bullion and coin.) The lower figure for exports is due to direct shipments of rubber from Malayan Union ports. In 1939, Singapore percentage of the total Malayan foreign trade in merchandise was approximately 67 per cent. for imports and 55 per cent. for exports.

The percentage of trade for 1947 was as follows:

| Imports | Exports | Total |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Per cent. | Per cent. | Per cent. |
| U.K.     | 16.2    | 14.4   | 15.4   |
| Other British countries | 25.6    | 23.4   | 24.6   |
| U.S.A.   | 11.0    | 27.2   | 18.1   |
| China    | 10.3    | .9     | 6.2    |
| N.E.I.   | 21.2    | 14.8   | 18.4   |
| Others   | 15.7    | 19.3   | 17.3   |
