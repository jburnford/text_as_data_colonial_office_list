JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 43' and 18° 32', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 20'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,207 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,423 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the S.W., and the Rio Grande in the N.E. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 48,504 in 1891, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 30' and 80° 35' W. long., are dependencies of Jamaica.* Pedro and Morant Cays are also dependencies, being two guano islands in 17° N. lat., as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands.†

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,692,480 acres, from which may be deducted 80,000 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,612,400 acres available for cultivation. Of this 663,560 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1897. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, while Governor of Hispaniola. Although invaded by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596, and by Colonel Jackson in 1638, it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was again attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II., who appointed General Edward D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. This town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston then consisted of a few sheds, and St. Jago de la Vega (Spanish town) became practically the capital. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves left by the Spaniards, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°1, rising to 87°8° in the day time, and falling to 70°7° at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons occur generally and over the whole of the island in May and October, and

* See account below.

last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfall, the ground is refreshed by continual showers; and in the N.E. portion of the island there is a rainy season usually at the end of the year. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches at sea level to as much as 197 inches at Blue Mountain Peak.

Only two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, four-fifths being pure negroes. There are about 14,000 imported coolies, and about 481 Chinese (in 1897). English is universally spoken.

**Constitution.**

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1866, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature willingly responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five *ex officio* members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

**Local Administration.**

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 14 other parishes, under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, waterworks, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population, in 1891, 48,504), Port Royal (population 1,200), Spanish Town (population 5,689), Montego Bay (population 4,651), Falmouth (population 3,029), and Port Maria (population 6,741).

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the Parochial Boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision. The several direct taxes received on land, houses, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected, with the exception of a few minor items, and a tax of 8d. in every 10l. of the gross value of the property, which go to the credit of the general revenue of the colony.

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1903-4 was 139,737l.; their expenditure 128,894l., and their debt at the end of the year 58,595l. These figures form part of the general revenue and expenditure, as given below.

There is a High Court of Justice and Petty Sessions of magistrates throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of Petty Sessions.

An "Island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty; the excise on rum (99,623l. in 1903-4) and stamps and licences. There is no direct taxation except that of the local boards, and the total of the direct taxes on land is less than 32,000l.

**Defence.**

The Constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are on the authorised strength 16 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 758 sub-officers and men, and 812 district constables distributed throughout the island. The force has been strengthened by the addition of sub-officers selected from the Royal Irish Constabulary.

There is an Imperial garrison stationed near Kingston, and a naval station at Port Royal. There is a militia force with an establishment of 800 officers and men.

**Currency and Banking.**

British currency, United States gold, and gold doubloons are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000l. The Colonial Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia are the only private
banking establishments in the Colony. The Colonial Bank has one branch and 4 agencies; it has a note circulation estimated at 150,000L. British silver coins above 6d. are legal tender to any extent; coins of 6d. and less amount to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent., and in 1897 to 2½ per cent. The total deposits on 31st March, 1904, were 425,757L.

**Education.**

Elementary education is left to private enterprise, aided, since 1867, by a system of grants-in-aid from the Colonial revenue. The number of schools is 711, with 47,803 scholars in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1902-1903 was 46,129L.; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for female teachers which is wholly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational college for male teachers, and a denominational college for female teachers. More than 100 students are now under training. By laws passed in 1892 a Board of Education has been constituted, and provision made for the opening of Government secondary schools where required. No provision is made from public funds for technical education, but there are some endowed schools and scholarships tenable at the English universities.

**Industry.**

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1903-4 being 82,630,540, with a value of 72,301L., and that of bananas being 7,803,243 bunches, with a value of 585,243L.

The other chief crops are sugar (export 270,493 cwt., value 121,722L.); coffee (export 80,061 cwt., value 112,085L.); ginger (export 28,310 cwt., value 42,465L.); pimento (export 71,078 cwt., value 88,847L.) and the exports comprise, in addition to those products, rum (export 1,293,716 gallons, value 97,028L.); dyewood (export 45,074 tons, value 117,263L.); cocoa (export 22,008 cwt., value 41,540L.). The area under sugar cane in 1903 was 21,479 acres, and under coffee 24,423. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations.

The coffee plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain Range. The great fruit growing district is in Portland, with Port Antonio for its outlet. Sugar is largely grown in the district of Vere in Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawney, where the best rum in the world is produced. The cattle-raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, alcohol, and building materials. Of the total trade of the island by far the greater portion is with the United Kingdom and the United States, Canada being next in importance.

**Means of Communication.**

There is a regular postal service throughout the island, daily between some places, and elsewhere three times per week, by means of mail coaches. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Within the Colony, per ½ oz. 1 | ½d. each. |
| To places* in Imperial Penny Postage | 1 ½d. per 2 oz. |
| To other Postal Union countries, per ½ oz. | ... 2½ ½d. per 2 oz. |

Parcels post with England;† with United States and British W. I. Colonies, 6d. per lb., and Canada 10d. per lb.

The estimated number of letters sent to the United Kingdom is 348,150, and the number sent to other places 266,083.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail contract steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Wednesday throughout the year. The average passage is 16 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The Imperial Direct West India Mail steamers leave Bristol every alternate Saturday, the Company receiving a subsidy of 40,000L. per annum from the Imperial Government and the Colony, and undertaking to carry 20,000 bunches of bananas to England every fortnight. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 73 stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 923, 650 miles along roads, and 273 along railway lines. The total cost of the telegraphs has been about 20,324L. The receipts in 1903-4 were 5,194L. 12s. 6d.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of Saint James, a distance of 113 miles 94 chains, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17 miles 17 chains; and to Port Antonio by a branch line from Bogwalk, on the Ewarton branch, of 54 miles 30 chains. The total length of line open is 184 miles 56½ chains. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge, providing for interest and repayment, is 121,812L. a year. The receipts in 1903-4 exceeded the expenditure by 34,790L., leaving a deficiency, after providing for the above charge, of 87,022L. There is also a line of telegraph along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 113 miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17 miles; and from Bogwalk to Port Antonio, 54 miles.

The island is intersected by a system of main roads, the condition of which will bear favourable comparison with those in many European countries. There are 1,943 miles of main roads, and about 4,318 miles of parochial roads.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, Sav-la-Mar, and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1902, 7 ships, with aggregate tonnage of 324 tons, were registered. At Kingston, 6, with a tonnage of 304 tons, and at Montego Bay 1, with a tonnage of 20 tons.

CAYMAN ISLANDS.

The Cayman Islands (a dependency of Jamaica) consist of three islands, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac, lying between 79° 44' and 80° 26' W. longitude, and 19° 44', and 19° 46' N. latitude. They were discovered by Columbus, on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession of them soon after the conquest of Jamaica, and they were mainly colonised from that island.

Grand Cayman is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, and varies from 4 to 7 miles in breadth. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized harbours. One on the north side of the island, called the Great Sound, measures over six miles across.

The principal industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle off the coasts of Central America, and among the Cuban Cays these turtles are brought to the island and placed in "kraals," to recover and fatten before being sent to their next stage, Jamaica, from whence they are exported. Over 5,000 turtles a year are thus disposed of at an average price in Caymanas of 1/ each.

The Island of Grand Cayman is in some parts fruitful, and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable average is traversed by cliffs, and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found in quantities. Phosphate deposits of some value exist, and were worked, but have lately been neglected.

There are two towns, Georgetown and Bodden-town, and several villages. The population of Grand Cayman numbered 4,322 at the census of 1891.

The smaller Cayman Islands, viz., Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are about 70 miles distant from Grand Cayman; they are almost entirely given up to the growth of cocoanuts. Their inhabitants numbered at the last reckoning 60 and 528 persons, respectively.

Fine schooners of native woods are continually being constructed at these islands for sale and for local use, the people being first-rate shipwrights.

The Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands consists of the Justices of the Peace and elected Vestrymen, and the laws passed by this body are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming operative.

The government of the Dependency is administered by a Commissioner.
