QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northeastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,060 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°; the latter, however, very rarely occurring. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from November to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera, of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.
Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, to which must be attributed the reduced output of many primary products.

Sugar growing has become a very important industry. In 1903 there were 111,516 acres under cane, of which 60,375 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 91,828 tons of sugar.

Maize was grown on 133,099 acres, and returned a yield of 1,923,623 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1903, 772 acres yielded 617 cwts. of cured leaf. Manufactured in the State during the year, 342,477 lbs.; cigars, 706 lbs.

In 1903 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 363 acres, which yielded 4,735 tons of tuber, and 683,883 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A considerable portion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. In 1903, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 6,189 acres were mown for hay, and 138,096 acres yielded 2,436,799 bushels of grain. 543 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,533 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 215,950,480 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 20,403,753 acres are leased as grazing farms and homesteads.

The chief exports were: Wool, 34,979,076 lbs., valued at 1,883,752l.; gold, 2,887,476l.; sugar, 646,932l.; live stock, 919,123l.; tin, 224,155l.; silver, 110,132l.; meat 960,033l.; meat extract, 11,066l.; hides and skins, 389,296l.; tallow, 119,997l.; green fruit, 114,539l.; copper, 294,764l.; butter, 49,804l.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important ones in the State, and gives employment to over 25,000 men. The leading mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mt. Morgan mine, Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in twenty-eight districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total quantity of gold exported during 1903 amounted to 970,008 ozs. The Herberton district is the headquarters of the silver, tin, and copper mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, and Selheim also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, antimony, wolfram, and quicksilver. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1903 being of the value of 7,300l., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems to the value of 7,000l. were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burrum and Peak Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1903 was 507,801 tons, valued at 164,789l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1903, 273 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 23,902.

Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1903 an indebtedness to the Government of 810,600l.
An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 668,497 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 934 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,045 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimerah Run; 564 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 375,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 196° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000£., so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony, and already about 14,786 acres are artificially watered by some 387 irrigationists. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51·20 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1901 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions.

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 33 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 227,000. The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1903 were £620,927.; their expenditure £647,097.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control £45,414,051., and debt £1,991,676£. Debts for water works, amounting to £832,170£., which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on the 31st December, 1903, an estimated population of 124,463 (ten-mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (15,506), Ipswich (15,246), Maryborough (12,900), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (19,691), Gympie (14,431), and Toowoomba (14,087), Charters Towers (20,976). All these include an area of five-mile radius. (Census 1901.)

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1903, 11 banks, with 169 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £2,036,113£.; deposits, £12,269,529£. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 79,958; the amount of deposits as £3,681,999£.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 31st December, 1903, the railways in Queensland showed 2,997 miles in operation, the cost of construction of opened lines being £21,214,072£., the revenue £1,266,027£., and the working expenses £832,440£. The following lines are now open for traffic:

- **The Southern and Western** from Brisbane to Cunnamulla; with its branches, Ipswich to Dugandan, North Ipswich to Tivoli, Brisbane Valley Junction to Cressbrook, Gowrie Junction via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crow's Nest, Wyreema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to The Tweed, connecting with the Southern and Western line by a loop to Corinda, with branches to Beaudesert, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Rockhampton, with branches to New Farm, Enoggera, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Degilbo, Wondai, Pialba, Cordalba, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

- **The Central Railway** is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches to Mount Morgan, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 32 miles of railway are open to Pinnacle, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

- **The Bowen Railway** is also open from that port to Wangaratta, a distance of 48 miles.

- **The Northern Railway** is open from Townsville to Winton, with branches to Ravenswood and Richmond having been carried through Charters Towers, the latter town, a great gold-mining centre, having a population of 20,976 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the sites of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook District a railway is constructed intended ultimately to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 67 miles of which are open for traffic.
Another railway is also constructed from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Mareeba, with a branch to Atherton, connecting with the private line to Chillagoe, tapping a large area rich in minerals. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, 94 miles, south-easterly.

There is also a steam tramway line from Townsville to Ayr, a distance of 50 miles.

There are 481 electric telegraph stations in the State. The number of miles of line 10,180, with 20,759 miles of wire. The receipts, excluding telephone service, 27,321l., were 110,587l.

The number of messages during 1903 was 1,500,551. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 3,749 subscribers who use it, and cables containing multiple wires are now being laid underground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street, and to secure a metallic circuit.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks, with supplementary steamers occasionally; via Brindisi and Melbourne every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every three weeks; via Vancouver every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi is thirty-four days. There is daily communication with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1903 there were in operation 1,023 schools with an enrolment of 108,869 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 171 private schools, with 14,694 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,027 pupils, on the roll.

A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, supervised by a Central Government Board, but conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

Defence.

The Military Forces of the Commonwealth, Queensland, were originally organised under the State Defence Acts, 1884 to 1896, to which Acts the force is still subject, and consists of:—(1) The District Head-Quarters Staff; (2) Instructional Staff; (3) Royal Australian Artillery and Engineers; (4) Militia; (5) Volunteers; (6) Rifle clubs; (7) Cadets. The Militia includes:—Staff, Horse and Field Artillery, Light Horse, Garrison Artillery, Engineers (Submarine Miners), Infantry, and Army Medical Corps. The rifle clubs take the oath of allegiance only; in time of peace the organisation is subject to rules adopted by the respective clubs. Under these Acts all male inhabitants of Queensland, between the ages of eighteen and sixty years, who are British subjects, and are not specially exempted, are, in case of war, or invasion, or imminent danger of either, liable to be called on for service in the force, the necessary number of men being obtained by ballot. Persons who have been selected by ballot to serve may secure exemption by providing a suitable substitute. The period of service is three years, and, in time of peace, corps are recruited by voluntary enlistment only. All members of the force are subject to the provisions of the Army Act, when called out for active service, during drill or training, and at other times when in uniform.

The whole organisation of the Commonwealth Forces is subject to the Commonwealth Defence Act.

Training.

Classes of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers are formed twice during the year for periods of one month for each course. Special classes are also formed in addition as required. Recruit squads are formed in connection with the different corps when required. Instruction is afforded by instructors of the Instructional Staff attached to the respective corps, and when the squads have performed forty drills and parades, including a course of musketry, they are inspected by an officer of the Instructional staff, and, if efficient, are passed into the ranks as trained men. All corps are inspected annually by the Commandant. Instructional Staff officers of the respective arms visit outlying districts periodically, attend parades and drills of corps, and afford instruction and give lectures on special subjects. The force is called out annually for continuous training.

The force is commanded by an officer, who is styled the "Commandant of the Commonwealth Military Forces, Queensland," and this position is now occupied by Colonel Tom Price, C.B. Every officer, except officers of the regular army, receives, in the first instance, a provisional appointment, and obtains a commission as lieutenant, after passing an examination, conducted by a Board of Examiners appointed by the Governor-General. Examinations are conducted in May and November each year.

The marine defence force of Queensland, organised under the Defence Acts, 1884-1896, consists of: (1) Permanent force; (2) Naval brigades (militia); (3) Naval volunteer cadets corps. The main provisions of the Acts have already been stated. When called out for active service, and during annual drill and training, all members of the force are subject to the provisions of the Naval Discipline Act.

Training.

The naval brigades drill two evenings a week (1½ hours each), cadets one (1) evening, and both parade on one half day per month (three hours). The respective corps are trained by permanent instructors, who are secured from H.M. Navy. All corps are inspected annually by Naval Commandant. The force is called out for six days' continuous training per annum, which is carried out afloat on H.M.Q.S. "Gayundah." Each corps is put through an annual musketry course.

Strength is at present reduced, as recruiting is temporarily stopped, pending Commonwealth reorganisation.

Immigration.

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 34,329, and the departures to all countries 34,286, showing an excess of arrivals of 43. The arrivals of Chinese numbered 417, and of Pacific Islanders 1,166, whilst the departures of these coloured aliens numbered 624 and 1,261, and their deaths 125 and 306 respectively.

By Act 53 Vict., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1889, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in some electorate or electorates, is entitled to be registered as an elector.
