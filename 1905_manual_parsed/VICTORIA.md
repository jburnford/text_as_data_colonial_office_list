VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the River Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass' Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the State meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S.; longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,946,691 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other States of the group, that it now contains 31 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The enumerated population, at the date of the census, 31st March, 1901, was 1,201,341, viz., 603,883 males and 597,458 females. These numbers give a proportion of 98·9 females to 100 males. The estimated population on 31st Dec., 1903, was 1,208,834, viz., 605,361 males and 603,493 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 577 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number 1,646. The postal and telegraph revenue is not accurately known, but was estimated to have been £38,578/- in 1903, and the expenditure was £82,520/.

Victoria, with the other Australasian States, having joined the Universal Postal Union from 1st October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia.

There are 3,376 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1903, was £40,965,849/. The revenue for 1902-3 was £3,046,858/, and the expenditure £2,032,087/.

There are 6,596 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 15,883 miles of wire; also about 22,995 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1903 was 2,233,638. There are 20 telephone exchanges in the State, with 7,610 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1903 was £93,434/.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the State where railway communication is not available.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other State of Australia. In regard to heat the weather is never severely oppressive, except...
during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was $57^\circ$; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91'3 feet above the sea level was 29.94 inches; rain falls on the average upon 132 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25.8 inches.

**History.**

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship *Endeavour*. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England, he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonisation, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by Acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig *Lady Nelson*. In October of the following year, an attempt was made to colonise the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the (as yet) unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when, on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

**Industry.**

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 4,021,590 acres being under cultivation in 1903–04. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 1,968,599 acres, producing only 28,525,579 bushels; oats, 433,636 acres, producing 13,434,952 bushels; barley, 47,760 acres, producing 1,218,003 bushels; potatoes, 48,930 acres, producing 167,736 tons; and hay, 733,353 acres, producing 1,233,063 tons. About 23,513 acres were devoted to the culture of the vine, producing 2,551,150 gallons of wine, and 53,447 cwt.s of raisins. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides in the last few years; in 1903 there were produced 46,685,727 lbs. of butter (of which 30,169,299 lbs. were exported) and 5,681,915 lbs. of cheese. On the 31st March, 1901, there were in the State 392,237 horses, 1,080,772 cattle, other than dairy cows, and 350,370 pigs. The wool exported in 1903 amounted to 84,560,603 lbs., valued at 3,186,054l. The amount of gold raised in 1903 was 822,424 ozs., making a total since 1851 of 66,736,336 ozs., valued at 266,718,701l. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with great success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the State will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of coal raised in 1903 was 64,200 tons. The chief exports other than wool...
and gold (which comprise nearly half of the total), are grain and flour, butter, hides and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea, and iron. Melbourne does 87 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wodonga, Wahgunyah, Yarrawonga, Gooramadda, Koondrook, Tocumwal, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1903 numbered 382, with a total tonnage of 113,126.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shope, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on thereat; were this done, the manufactories of the State might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. According to the latest returns there are in the State 63 flour mills, which during the year operated upon 5,762,449 bushels of wheat, and 139,702 bushels of other grain; 44 breweries, in which 15,473,149 gallons of beer were brewed; 110 brickyards, which make also potteries, which made 79,105,831 bricks, pipes and tiles valued at 81,732l.; and pottery valued at 34,572l.; 94 tanneries, fellmongeries, and wool-washing establishments, which tanned 1,211,177 hides and skins; 9 woollen mills, which used 3,772,390 lbs. of wool and produced 3,863,606 yards of tweed, cloth, and flannel, 77,601 pairs of blankets, and 6,665 shawls; 20 soap and candle works, which made 151,414 cwts. of soap, and 45,052 cwts. of candles; 12 tobacco manufactories, which manufactured 2,390,976 lbs. of tobacco, 116,699 lbs. of cigars, and 134,400 lbs. of cigarettes; 6 distilleries, which made 40,348 gallons of spirits; 206 butter and cheese factories, which made 46,685,727 lbs. of butter, 5,681,515 lbs. of cheese, 236,581 gallons of concentrated milk, and sold 17,882 gallons of cream; 24 bacon and ham-curing establishments, which cured 12,504,851 lbs. of bacon and ham; 266 establishments working in books or stationery; 2 in musical instruments; 30 in carving and figures; 10 in designs, medals, and dies; 5 in philosophical instruments; 4 in surgical instruments; 5 in arms and ammunition; 303 in machines, tools, implements, &c.; 334 in carriages and harness; 8 in ships and boats; 90 in saw-moulding, joinery, &c.; 187 in furniture; 29 in chemicals; 1,099 in textiles and dress; 15 in animal food; 72 in vegetable food; 157 in drinks and stimulants; 41 in animal matters; 67 in building materials; 37 in oils and fats; 19 in malt; 364 in vegetable matters; 68 in coal, gas, electric light, etc.; 3 salt works; 15 railway workshops; 52 in gold, silver, and precious stones; 8 in glass; 2 in asbestos; 227 in metals other than gold and silver; and 44 in miscellaneous products.

The total number of all establishments is 4,151, of which 2,040 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 42,750. They employ 73,229 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is 12,978,841l.

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other States. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. The more important works, connected with the principal rivers to provide for the supply for local schemes, are undertaken by and under the direct control of the State. These are known as "National Works," the total expenditure on which to 30th June, 1904, amounted to 981,311l. Local schemes are carried out by "Irrigation and Water Supply Trusts," constituted by the Governor in Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Loans are advanced by the Government, and the Commissioners are empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation within the area under their jurisdiction, in order to provide the annual interest on the loan and the necessary payment to the sinking fund; also to defray the current expenses attendant upon the operations of the trust. On 30th June, 1903, there were 21 of these trusts working, the land under their jurisdiction capable of being irrigated amounting to 1,611,551 acres, of which 149,506 acres were irrigated. The total cost of construction of the works was 1,049,000l.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, at the end of 1903, had a population of 501,460. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (51,320), Bendigo (42,540), Geelong (25,801), Warrnambool (6,600), Castlemaine (8,003), Maryborough (5,750), and Stawell (5,200).

Chinese.

By the Chinese Immigration Restriction Act, 1888, the immigration of Chinese was limited to one Chinese to every 500 tons known of any vessel arriving. There are not more than 7,500 in the State.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 525 in all, throughout the State during the last quarter of 1903:-The Bank of Australasia; of New South Wales; of New Zealand; of Victoria; Colonial of Australasia; Commercial of Australia; English, Scottish and Australian; London of Australia; National of Australasia; Royal of Australia; and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to 30,429,303l., and the value of the notes in circulation to 913,590l.

There are also 53 banks and branches, with 325 agencies at Post Offices of the Savings Bank. The number of accounts open on the 30th June, 1903,
was 418,511, and the amount on deposit was 10,341,867/. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of about 4,000,000l. is coined annually.

**Education.**

Education establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognised in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1903 was 628. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1903, the total number of students who matriculated was 4,895, and 3,074 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 5 Schools of Art, 10 Schools of Mines, and 3 Working Men's Colleges; there is also 1 Agricultural and 1 Horticultural College. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the number of students enrolled in the fourth term of 1903 was 2,104.

The system of primary public instruction, which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 13, and State instruction is granted free of cost. In 1902-3 there were 1,988 State schools, with a total enrolment of 257,655 scholars, instructed by 5,037 teachers. The average attendance was 150,268. In 1902-3 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was 674,076l. There is no local control over the schools. The teachers are paid partly by a fixed salary and partly by results.

The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1902-3, there were 798 private schools in Victoria, with 2,369 teachers, and an attendance of 45,650 scholars. Of these the Roman Catholic denomination had about one-fourth, about one-third of the teachers, and over half the scholars.

**Government.**

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is the official head of the Legislature, and assents in the name of the Crown to Acts passed by the Parliament. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 35 members (including one representative of the public and railway servants) elected for 17 Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 68 members (including one representative of the public service and two representatives of the railway servants) returned by 65 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

The constitution of the two Houses and the qualification of Members and Electors have been amended on several occasions; and a Reform Act received the Royal Assent on 26th November, 1903. By this Act the number of Members of both Houses was reduced, the franchise for the Upper House broadened, and the property qualification for membership reduced, and several other reforms made, including separate representation of the public and railway servants.

One of the two Members of Council returns for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every three years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council, except in case of a deadlock between the two Houses. The property qualification of members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 50l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 15l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, matriculated students of the University of Melbourne, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-masters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered. By the Reform Act of 1903 the Council is now empowered to suggest alterations in these Bills.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage virtually exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1889, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is, under ordinary circumstances, three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856, and by an Act passed in October, 1900, provision is made for voting by post in certain cases.

All members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

An Act was passed in December, 1903, limiting the amount which may be expended by candidates for election expenses to 400l. and 160l., for the Council and the Assembly respectively. The purposes for which such expenditure may be incurred are also defined.
Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,320 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the State. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality, except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1903-04 there were 60 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 148 shires. The number of ratepayers was about 311,000; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 11,437,830l.; representing a value in fee simple of 209,143,730l.; the total income in 1903 (including 98,609l. received from Government) was 1,279,062l., and the expenditure was 1,198,229l.; whilst their indebtedness amounted to 4,212,051l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1903 was 177,233l., and its expenditure 150,174l. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1903 amounted to 2,000,000l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1902-03 the Board's ordinary revenue was 362,450l., and its expenditure 398,879l., exclusive of 354,807l. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1903, amounting to 8,172,337l., of which, however, 2,082,337l. was raised in the first instance by the general Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works in course of construction amounted to 4,174,305l. up to the 30th June, 1903.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities and the Insurance Companies. In 1903 their revenue amounted to 54,355l., their ordinary expenditure to 53,171l., and their debt to 130,000l.

The Melbourne Tramways Trust is a Municipal Corporation, created for the purpose of constructing tramways in Melbourne and suburbs, which it has done at a cost of 1,705,794l., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. This debt will be gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a public company, to whom the lines have been let for a period of 30 years. On the 2nd January, 1904, the sinking fund amounted to 704,000l.

Defences.

The land forces, chiefly militia, at the end of 1902-3 comprised an establishment of 6,860 men of all arms, of whom 382 were permanent and 4,763 formed the militia, the remainder (1,715) being volunteers. In addition to these there were about 19,000 members of Rifle Clubs.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 224 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship Cerberus, the first-class torpedo-boats Countess of Hopetoun and Childers, the second-class torpedo boats Nepean and Lonsdale, and the torpedo launch Gordon.
