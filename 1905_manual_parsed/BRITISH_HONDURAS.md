BRITISH HONDURAS.

Situation and Area.

British Honduras is a Colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the rapids of Gracias a Dios on the River Saratoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier, on the south by Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18° 29' and 15° 54' N. latitude and 89° 10' and 87° 50' W. longitude.

The area of the Colony is 7,562 square miles, about the size of Wales, including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George's, English, Turneffe and other Cays, 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. It is estimated that about 90 square miles are under cultivation.

History.

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers, who were attracted by the fine timber (logwood and mahogany) which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were long at St. George's Cay. The name of the present chief town and of the River Belize is alleged to be a corruption of the name of the buccaneer Wallis, who was driven from Hispaniola in that year, and who is said to have been the leader of the settlers.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito coast, in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers, and their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection, and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain, and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Rustan, and at Black River on the mainland. Rustan was abandoned in 1749, but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements. By the treaty of Paris in 1763 it was agreed to abandon the settlements, and the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay," the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms; and treaty after treaty was concluded, which had little other effect than to stimulate the enterprise of the settlers by the recognition, thus step by step accorded, of the footing they had gained for themselves in Central America, without, in the first instance, any thought of territorial aggrandisement, but solely in pursuit of the industry in which their fortunes were embarked.

The Bay Islands were recognised as part of the Republic of Honduras in 1859.

The only subsequent events of external significance which need here be noticed, are the definition, as above, of the boundaries of the Colony (of which a survey has been partially executed); and the frequent border troubles, connected with the revolt in
1849 of the Indian population of Yucatan against the Spanish inhabitants, the result of which was that the Indians were in possession of the country to a considerable distance north of the Hondo until 1901, when the Mexicans subjugated them. Occasional incursions into the Colony were made from time to time by the Indians, the last being, in 1872, by the Icaiche tribe on the N.W. frontier.

**Constitution.**

The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1756 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790-1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1839 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted, consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on the 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, and a Legislative Council substituted therefor, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial, members, with the Lieutenant-Governor as President. By Ordinance 14 of 1892, the Council now consists of three official and five unofficial members. On the 31st October, 1884, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica.

The English Common Law extends to the Colony as far as local circumstances render such extension suitable, and subject to modification by Colonial ordinances. By Ordinance No. 2 of 1884, provision was made for the revision, consolidation and publication of the laws of the Colony, and such laws having been revised and consolidated into one volume, they were brought into operation by Ordinance No. 7 of 1888, and are known as "The Consolidated Laws of British Honduras"; appeals lie to the Privy Council, and by 44 and 45 Vict., cap. 36, 16, the Supreme Court of Jamaica.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, and six members, three of whom are ex officio, the other three appointed members.

For administrative purposes the Colony is divided into six districts—Belize, which includes the capital at the mouth of the river of the same name; the Corosol district; the Orange Walk district; the western or Cayo district; the Stann Creek district; and the Toledo district, the main station of which is Punta Gorda, comprising the extreme south of the Colony.

**Defence.**

A Volunteer Light Infantry Corps was established at Belize in 1897, and now consists of 7 officers and 166 non-commissioned officers and men.

The Police Force consists of three officers and 113 non-commissioned officers and men (about 20 mounted) for the whole Colony.

**General Description.**

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached. The characteristic soils of the Colony are known as Cahoon ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), the Pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass), and Broken ridge (intermediate between these two). Besides these there are swamp, savannah, and mountain.

The chief rivers are in the north of the Colony, and run in a north-easterly direction, the Belize reaching the sea on the east, and the Hondo and the New River on the north.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscomb Mountains a height of some 4,000 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pasturage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. The soil generally was rich, but a few rugged spots were encountered. Some fine gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered, and other indications of minerals were noticed.

In 1888 Governor Sir R. Goldsworthy, with an exploring party, ascended the Cockscomb Mountains.

**Industry.**

The chief industry is wood-cutting, now 200 years old. 9,358,776 feet of mahogany, 706,633 feet of cedar, and 14,205 tons of logwood were exported in 1903. The next in importance is fruit, the exports in 1903 having been 524,811 bunches bananas, 2,243,350 (number) plantains, and 3,738,264 cocoanuts. Specie to the amount of $472,874 was exported in 1903. The Colony also produces rubber, sapodilla or chewing gum, sponges, and tortoise-shell.

Alternating with stretches of sandy plain, yielding pine trees, are large areas of very rich land on which, in addition to mahogany and many beautiful hard woods of which little or no use is made, the cahoon palm and vanilla orchid are most noticeable by reason of their abundance and the luxuriance with which they grow. The Colony has not yet been exploited by the economic botanist, otherwise these rich oil-bearing nuts and vanilla would certainly have been turned to profitable account instead of being allowed to go to waste. There is a wide field for the colonist with a little capital and a stock of perseverance and common sense, as this virgin forest land is being offered for sale at a dollar an acre.

A contract was signed in September, 1903, for the sale of the pine trees on Crown land to Mr. B. Chepley, a citizen of the United States, at
a price of 1 cent per tree. It is anticipated that the opening up of the interior of the Colony, which will be necessary for the purposes of this contract, will be of great benefit to trade.

Belize is a port of registry, and had registered, on 31st December, 1903, 265 vessels, of 5,997 aggregate tonnage.

The imports consist mainly of cotton goods and hardware, malt liquors, spirits, refined sugar, tea, tobacco, wines, provisions, and specie. The commercial intercourse is mainly with the United States and Great Britain.

Communications.

There are no railways in the Colony, and the easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is regular communication every seven days by mail steamers with New Orleans and Puerto Cortez; and about every six weeks with Liverpool and Colon. The usual length of the journey between England and British Honduras is 16 days, via the United States. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Livingston, Guatemala, whence the steamer takes one day; but the best way to send telegrams is via New Orleans, U.S.A.

A land line has been constructed from Belize to the Hondo, and is being carried across the river to connect with the Mexican telegraph system.

Surveys have been made with a view to the construction of a trans-colonial railway to develop the interior, but the scheme has not been proceeded with.

There are post offices at Belize, Corosol, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda, San Estevan, All Pines, Monkey River and Mullins River.

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 98°, the minimum 50°. The dew point in Belize, a seaport, is relatively high. Sea breezes prevail for the greater part of the year. The average rainfall during the past twenty years has been 81.48 inches per annum. From the middle of February to the middle of May is the dry season. For the rest of the year there is rain to some extent during every month, the heaviest rainfall being in the months of September, October and November, during which months about one-third of the total rain occurs.

Currency and Banking.

Up to the 14th October, 1894, the coins in circulation were principally South and Central and American silver dollars; there was no paper currency. The standard of value was the Guatemalan dollar, and Chilian and Peruvian silver coins were also current and legal tender, as well as a colonial currency of one-cent pieces, at fixed ratings with the Guatemalan dollar. By Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, the currency has been established on a gold basis, the United States gold dollar being adopted as the standard coin. Gold coins of the United States Mint are legal tender for the amounts of their respective denominations in standard dollars; also the British sovereign and half-sovereign for the amounts of $4.867 and $2.433 respectively. There is a local subsidiary currency of 50 cent, 25 cent, 10 cent, and 5 cent silver pieces, and a Government note issue of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dollars; a bronze cent piece is also current. The limit of the legal tender in silver is fixed at $10, and in bronze at 50 cents. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corosol, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda, and the Cayo), had, on 31st March, 1903, $63,470.

On the 14th January, 1903, The Bank of British Honduras, Ltd., commenced business with a fully paid up capital of $50,000. Since then the capital has been increased to $100,000, of which $73,000 has been issued. It is a local institution, with a local directorate, registered under Chapter 87 of the Consolidated Laws. It is a bank of deposit and discount, but not of circulation.

Education.

The schools, both Secondary and Primary, are, with one or two exceptions, denominational. With few exceptions, all Primary schools are inspected and aided by the Colonial Government. Thirty-seven received aid in 1903, to the extent of $12,541.16, with 3,444 scholars on the roll, and 2,517 average attendance. The total cost of Primary education for the year was $25,045.14.

The total number of pupils on the roll in all the schools was about 4,004, with an average attendance of 2,948.

Population.

The population on the 31st March, 1903, was reported as follows:
