Straits Settlements.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict., c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 288 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 265 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent, dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ½ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. The population is 696. The boundaries of the Settlement of Singapore have been extended so as to include these Islands.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 200 miles S.W. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., annexed in July, 1888, was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889, and was formally annexed to the Settlement of Singapore in 1900. It is nine miles long and nine miles wide; wooded, and has only a few inhabitants.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is 1,542 square miles (nearly equal to that of Kent).

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent State from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English, and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland of the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should leave the Malay Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang.
in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch restrictions; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon (Puket or Tongkah), and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Province Wellesley. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 288 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and coconuts. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Péral in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Native Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British, and the whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

There is some evidence of Singapore having been an important trading centre in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the tradition is that the place was attacked and devastated in 1252 by the Javanese. Thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. It was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated, in 1826, with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 9 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Defence.

The new harbour of Singapore, comprising the coal stores, wharves, and docks, is defended by several forts, and by a system of submarine mines. The initial cost of the forts amounted to nearly 100,000£., and was defrayed out of the revenue of the Colony; the Imperial Government supplying the guns and ammunition only.

The garrison comprised in 1903 one battalion of British infantry and one battalion of Madras infantry, two companies of garrison artillery on the higher establishment and district establishment Royal artillery, one company of Asiatic artillery, half a company of fortress engineers, and a company of Malay submarine miners.

The Colony also maintains an armed police force, consisting of 33 officers and 2,000 men, and a battery of volunteer artillery in Singapore, consisting of 151 officers and men. A Rifle volunteer corps is also maintained in Penang, established in 1899, and consists of 113 officers and men.

In 1903 a company of volunteer engineers was raised for Singapore (present strength 34 officers and men), and, in the same year, a volunteer rifle corps composed of Eurasians and Straits-born Chinese was established in Singapore. The strength of this latter corps is 227 officers and men. In Malacca a company of rifle volunteers, 60 strong, has been formed, and in both Singapore and Malacca there are cadet companies in connection with the rifle volunteers.

Climate.

The climate varies but little in temperature during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1903 was 79°9' F.; in Penang, 80°6' F.; in Province Wellesley, 81°2' F.; and in Malacca, 79°3' F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 91°5' and 69°9' F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1894 to 1903, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 174 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 93°22 inches. In 1903 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 103°98 inches; in Penang 103°91 inches; in Province Wellesley 73°51 inches; in Malacca 69°04 inches; and in the Dindings 91°15 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have southeast, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.
Population.

At the census taken in April, 1891 and 1901, the population of the Settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1891   | 1901   |
|----------------|--------|--------|
| Singapore      | 184,554| 228,555|
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 235,618| 258,207|
| Malacca        | 92,170 | 95,487 |
| Total          | 512,342| 572,249|

The total at the census of 1866 was 273,000.

Trade.

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 1 anna per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca and rice (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley).

The quantities of some of the exports in 1903 were approximately: Coffee, 118,000 piculs; gambier, 648,000 piculs; principal gums, 396,000 piculs; principal spices, 920,000 piculs; tapioca, 1,009,000 piculs; and tin, 907,000 piculs. The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The quantity imported in 1903 were: Cotton piece goods, 5,266,000 pieces; coal, 576,000 tons; rice, 6,796,000 piculs; opium, 16,699 chests; and silk piece goods, 521,000 pieces; petroleum, 2,435,000 cases; sarongs, 275,000 corses; fish (dry and salted), 610,000 piculs; tobacco, 108,000 piculs; tin ore, 892,000 picula; wheat flour, 484,000 piculs. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Native States. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st December, 1903, 770 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 84,364 tons.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe via Ceylon, and with China and Japan weekly by the P. and O., Messageries Maritimes; in addition there is a fortnightly service via India, and fortnightly by packets of the Norddeutscher-Lloyd and Hamburg-American Line, and the Steamship Company “Nederland” Line; and at longer intervals by Holt’s, East Asiatic Austro-Hungary Lloyd’s, British India Asia, Glen Japanese, and other lines; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong and via Labuan, by Spanish packets; with Bangkok weekly by Norddeutscher-Lloyd and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Messageries Maritimes and Netherlands India Company’s steamers; with Australian ports weekly, and otherwise by P. and O. and Messageries Maritimes, via Ceylon, by British India, China Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the Negapatam steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and other ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines; and the Norddeutscher-Lloyd has a large fleet of steamers running between Singapore and most of the neighbouring foreign ports. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 21 to 24 days.

Postage and Communications.

|                | Letters, Newspapers, per ½ oz. per 2 ozs. cents. cents. |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Within the Colony, and to the Federated Malay States and Johore | 3 1 |
| To U.K., India, and certain Colonies, etc.* | 4 1 |
| Elsewhere | 8 1 |

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1903 to $2,066,641, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, and the Native States.

There is telegraphic communication by 3 submarine cables from Penang to Madras, Malacca, and Singapore; and from Singapore there are 3 cables (1) to Saigon and Hong Kong, (2) to Labuan and Hong Kong, (3) to Saigon, Hué, Haiphong, Hainan, and Hong Kong. There is also a Government telegraph line from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Sungei, Ujong, and Malacca. There are 130 miles of telegraph line in connection with the cables, and there are 1,900 miles of telephone line. There is a telephone exchange worked by the Oriental Telephone Company in Singapore, and one worked by the Post Office in Penang. A railway, 23 miles long, connects Prai in Province Wellesley with the Perak railway system. A railway, 15½ miles long, from the town of Singapore to Kranji, on the Straits of Johore, constructed by the Colonial Government, is now open for traffic.

Education.

An Ordinance to provide for the compulsory attendance, under certain conditions, of male children between the ages of seven and twelve years has been passed, and came into operation in Malacca in 1903, and in Province Wellesley in 1904. The expenditure on education is voted each year by the Legislative Council of the Colony. The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Public Instruction.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsectarian. A reformatory for juvenile offenders and vagrants has been opened, in which technical instruction is provided.

* See list at end of Introduction. A reduced rate for parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on 1st January, 1899.
The number of schools and scholars is as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Grant-in-aid boys' schools | 22 | 5,287 | 5,045 |
| Grant-in-aid girls' schools | 10 | 1,359 | 1,205 |
| Government English schools | 6 | 1,853 | 1,699 |
| Government vernacular boys' schools | 142 | 8,756 | 6,963 |
| Government vernacular girls' schools | 29 | 861 | 639 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetized from 1st September, 1904, and it is proposed that steps shall be taken to fix a gold value for the Straits dollar.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, and the Netherlands Trading Society.

The two first-mentioned Banks are allowed under their Charters to issue notes. The average amount of notes so issued and in circulation in 1903 was $4,176,913.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation has rapidly increased as the following figures show:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec. 1899—$3,920,000
" " " " 1890—$6,105,000
" " " " 1901—$9,178,000
" " " " 30th June, 1902—$12,395,900
" " " " 1903—$15,290,297
" " " " 1904—$17,102,490

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in British North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1903, the deposits amounted to $583,843.

A scheme was in 1902 drawn up for placing the salaries of the higher officers in the service of the S.S. and Federated Malay States Governments on a sterling basis from 1st January, 1903.

Existing higher officers had the option of accepting a salary in sterling (to be paid in dollars locally according to a monthly rate of exchange), or in the alternative, continue to draw their dollar salary together with exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar = 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave pay and pension at home.

The native Weights are—

1 kati = 16 tahil = 1 lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 533¾ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipal Boards at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, the members of which are partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1903 was $2,580,560; and the expenditure $2,823,671.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years prior to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (29th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889, by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State, and are subordinate to the Resident-General and to the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In addition to the above States, the State and Territory of Johor, with which a treaty had been made as early as the year 1855, and other treaties subsequently, entered into closer relations with the Colony in 1880, when the Sultan, by Agreement of 11th December, 1885 (C.4627), placed his foreign relations in the hands of the British Government, and agreed to receive a British Agent, who, however, has not yet been appointed.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States other than Johor, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements stand, the States agree to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertake to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys advanced being considered as loans, and also undertake to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power, they engage to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States named meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

Railways.

The length of open line is 340 miles, as follows:—Province Wellesley, Perak, Selangor, and Negri Sembilan, 23, 171, 127, and 19 miles respectively. There are also 21 miles in the Negri Sembilan worked by a company.

The length of lines under construction is about 60 miles in the Negri Sembilan. Through communication from Prai, in Province Wellesley, to Seremban, in the Negri Sembilan, a distance of 280 miles, was made in July, 1903. The total length of the whole line from Prai to Singapore, when completed, excluding branches, will be about 500 miles. The branch lines run to Port Weld, Teluk Anson, Port Swettenham, and Port Dickson.

An extension of 64 miles of the main line from Seremban to the Johore boundary is now under construction, and arrangements have been made with the Sultan of Johore for an extension through that State to Singapore, a distance of about 120 miles. The survey of this line is already in hand.

Perak.

H.H. Sir Idris Mersid-el-Aazam Sham, G.C.M.G., Sultan.

Perak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment to the Seychelles of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State is well watered, the Perak, with its tributaries the Kinta, Batang, Padang, Bidor, and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau, and the Bernam, with its tributary, the Slim. The mountains on the east boundary, being part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of 8,000 feet.

The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown, and tea and coffee plantations have been opened with success. The cultivation of rubber and other products are now attracting attention. In the Krian district the Government has in hand an extensive scheme for irrigation of some 63,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta and Batang Padang are the chief mining districts, the tin from the former being shipped at Port Weld, the port of Taiping, which is the headquarters of Government, and from the latter two at Teluk Anson, a port near the mouth of the Perak River. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains rich deposits of tin and a little gold. A road and railway have recently been constructed through this part of the State.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is 641 miles of cart roads, and 584 miles of bridle paths.

Selangor.

H.H. Sulieman bin Almerhom Raja Musa, Sultan.

Selangor adjoins Perak along its southern frontier. Its inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Perak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines. The State is drained by four rivers: the Bernam, Selangor, Klang, and Langat.

Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula, there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet, and one of 6,200 feet.

The chief town is Kwala Lumpur, which is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula. The chief industry of the State is tin-mining. Coffee-planting, under European supervision, which made good progress for some years, has received a severe check owing to the fall in the price of Liberian coffee; and rice, pepper, and other products have been grown with success. Owing to the low price of coffee, great numbers of gutta trees have been planted, with a view to the development of a trade in rubber. Coconuts also are receiving attention. The total mileage in Selangor is 454 miles of cart roads, and 198 miles of bridle paths.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Tungku Mohamed, C.M.G., Yang di-Pertuan Besar.

The Federal State of the Negri Sembilan, as at present constituted, dates from 1895; but a Federation under that title already existed in the last century. The present federation consists of the following States, viz., Sungei, Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and of the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencbeh. The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban; and there are district officers at Port Dickson, on the coast, Kwala Klawang in Jelebu, Kwala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and Tampin. The total mileage of roads in the Negri Sembilan is 292 miles of cart roads and 151 miles of bridle paths.

The revenue is derived mainly from tin and agriculture. The miners are Chinese, the Malay population being almost entirely agricultural. Gold reefs exist in Gemencbeh and on the Muar River. Coffee has been successfully cultivated, and there are many large tapioca and gambier estates. Rubber has also been extensively planted in recent years. There is also a considerable production of rice. A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Ahmad Maithan Shah Ahmad, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang, the largest of the Protected Native States, is on the east coast of the Peninsula. Its native rulers have for many years looked southward, of later years to the Colony, for protection against their northern neighbours.

Gunong Tahan, which is said to be about 10,000 feet high, and therefore the highest summit in the Peninsula, was nearly ascended in 1899 by Mr. W. W. Skeat.
Besides containing the highest summit, the State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Samantan, Triang, Bara Lui, and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last-named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

These rivers are unfortunately so shallow as to be navigable for only steam launches and other small craft, except in the rainy season; and during the north-east monsoon their mouths are difficult of access.

The country is rich in gold, tin, and galena, and several companies under European or Australian direction are at work. The capital has hitherto been Pekan, near the mouth of the Pahang River, where the Sultan still resides, but the seat of government has been removed 200 miles up stream to Kuala Lipis. A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Lipis in this State, and a cart road, 83 miles in length, has been constructed from Kuala Kubu, on the F.M.S. Railway, to Kuala Lipis. A branch road has also been made with Government assistance from Tras to Bentong, a distance of some 20 miles, for the purpose of opening up the mines in that district, and a trunk road from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan is under construction.

**TRANSVAAL.**

**Situation and Area.**

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange River Colony and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22° S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude.

Its area is 111,196 square miles, with a population, according to the census of 17th April, 1904, of 1,268,716, of whom 299,327 are whites, 945,498 aboriginal natives, and 23,891 other coloured races. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea. The climate is healthy, except in the lower country, to the north and east, which is hot and often feverish. The winter is the dry, and the summer the wet, season. Heavy storms are frequent in summer.

Swaziland is a dependency of the Government of the Transvaal, lying on its eastern border. Its extent is 6,536 square miles, and its population consists of 84,531 natives and 898 whites.

**History.**

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown, most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1858, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000l. in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000l. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetewayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuana chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerrilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.
he annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shep-
pe at the time had with him but a few mounted
cemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not
ive in the province for some time after the
ish Government had been set up, with the
arent acquiescence of the public. But subse-
ently hostile feelings towards the annexation
e widely manifested, and two deputations were
t to England after annexation, to represent
ce who were opposed to that measure and
ired a withdrawal of the British Government.
each case the answer of Her late Majesty's
vernment was a decided negative.

n December,1880, a majority of the Boers took
arms against the Government, and hoisted the
of the South African Republic at Heidelberg.
e towns held by Imperial troops were imme-
ately invested, and a detachment of the 94th
giment, which was being withdrawn from
denburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force
headquarters, was surprised, and after suffer-
very heavy loss, compelled to surrender.
The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy
lley, without waiting for reinforcements, col-
led the small force at his disposal and advanced
on Maritzburg to relieve them. A large force
Boers, determined to oppose his entry into the
ansvaal, took possession of Laing's Nek, the path
which he had to cross the Drakensberg range.
On the 28th of January the English troops made
gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but
ey were driven back with heavy loss.
Theers followed up this advantage by cutting off
r G. Colley's communications with Newcastle,
ith a view to prevent his receiving the rein-
rements which had been sent out, and were now
the way up. To re-open his communications
crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of
the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked
by the Boers. The action continued all day; at
ghtfall the Boers drew off, and the English
forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being
made by President Brand, of the Orange Free
state, to bring about an understanding, and in
spite of the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's
overnment, they declared that if the Boers would
exist from armed opposition to the English troops,
scheme would be framed for the permanent
riendly settlement of all difficulties. This message
was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February,
in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of
their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was
required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger
was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent
opened to the headquarters of the Boers at
Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State
Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to
General Colley that no definite answer could be
given to the message from Her Majesty's Govern-
ment until Mr Kruger's views were known. Dr.
Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's
Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the
26th of February, General Colley, having received
no reply to his message, moved out with three
hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the
summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the
Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at
Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain
next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss,
while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped.
The rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners.
Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a
bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood,
who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the ad-
vance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of
President Brand, an interview took place on the
6th of March between him and General Joubert,
who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek,
which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice,
with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr.
Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's
Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on
the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received
by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was
considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace
agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E.
Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The
terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's
Government should allow the Transvaal self-
government as regards its own interior affairs;
that the control and management of the foreign
relations of the State should be reserved to Her
Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of
the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident.
The functions of this officer, and the provisions
for the protection of the interests of the native
population, were to be determined by Her
Majesty's Government on the recommendation of
a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to
consider the whole question of the settlement of
the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson,
Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief
Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand
was invited to be present at the conferences of the
Commissioners with the representatives of the
Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The
sittings of the Commission were opened on the
28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were
afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recom-
mendations of the Commission were submitted in
detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the
result a Convention was framed embodying the
terms of the peace agreement, assigning the
boundaries of the State, defining the functions of
the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-
general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon
him extensive powers for the protection of the
interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also
formed the medium of communication between
the Government of the Transvaal and the native
States on its borders. Stipulations were made
for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her
Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the
Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-
commission, composed of the two judges of the
High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident,
was appointed to consider claims for compensation
for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of
August, and on the 8th of that month the Govern-
ment was handed over to the representatives of
the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified
by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little
disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Conven-
tion, and constant trouble occurred on the border,
especially on the South-Western border, where the
Bechuanaland tribes suffered severely from the
incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal,
which the Transvaal Government entirely failed
to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to
account by acquiring fresh territory in violation
of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her
Majesty's Government yielded to representa-
tions of the Transvaal Government and granted
a new Convention, which was signed in London
on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX. to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to £77,877l., had risen in 1890 to £1,229,061l., reaching £3,329,938l. in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1896, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his inter-mediation Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiations. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 16th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic,
and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years' offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years' franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

After some correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissance from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R.
Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveley after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronjé was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.

The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions."
His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation was accordingly by Ordinance.

On 23rd March, 1903, a Customs Agreement was signed, under which the Transvaal and Southern Rhodesia entered the Customs Union, the result being that a common tariff was established for all the South African Colonies. All transit dues were abolished, and considerable reductions were made in through railway rates. The list of South African products which are carried over the railways at preferential rates—this constituting a second line of Protection—was reduced from 110 to 58 articles. A rebate is granted on articles manufactured in the United Kingdom of 25% of the duty in certain cases and of the whole duty in those cases where it is 2½ ad valorem (ironmongery, etc.); a similar rebate may be made to any British colony giving equivalent reciprocal privileges to the Union.

**Railways.**

The lines of the Netherlands Railway Company (Nederlandsche Zuid Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappij), a company based at Amsterdam in 1887, were at the time of the outbreak of war 717 miles long, consisting of lines connecting the Rand and Pretoria with the Cape and Orange Free State systems, with Natal and with Delagoa Bay. The line from the Cape reached Johannesburg in 1892, and is 52 miles long from the Vaal to Johannesburg. The connections with Natal (Charlestown to Johannesburg, 178 miles) and Delagoa Bay (from Portuguese border to Johannesburg, 341 miles) were opened in 1895. There are also branches from Springs through Johannesburg to Klerksdorp (102 miles), and from Kaupmuiden to Barberton (38 miles). The Pretoria-Pietersburg line, which originally belonged to a London company, is 178 miles long and was opened for traffic in October, 1898. In 1904 the length of open lines in the Transvaal was 915 miles, and 179 miles were under construction.

All these lines now come under the Central South African Railways Administration.*

In March, 1903, a conference of representatives of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony was held, at which the following construction scheme was approved:

| Miles | Rate Per Mile (Including 1,000 for Rolling Block) |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
|       | £                                              |
| Total | 997,000                                        |
| 137   | 6,840                                          |
| 175   | 7,600                                          |
| 88    | 8,400                                          |
| 84    | 6,500                                          |

* See under "South Africa."
Krugersdorp to Rustenburg was proceeded with. The Inter-Colonial Council, however, in November ratified certain agreements by which the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will benefit. These were for the construction of (1) a railway from Bethlehem to Kroonstad in the latter colony, forming a link between the Natal system via Ladysmith and Harrismith and the trunk line from Cape Colony to Johannesburg. This line is to be constructed by the Government of Natal. (2) Bethlehem to Modderpoort. (3) Ladybrand to Modderpoort, to be built by the Orange River Colony and the municipality of Ladybrand. (4) Aliwal North, on the Orange River, to Wepener, on the Basutoland frontier, to be built by the Cape Government. The length of these lines is 339 miles.

An agreement has been made with the De Beers Company, under which the Company provide the funds for the construction by the Central South African Railways of a line between Fourteen Streams and Klerksdorp. The estimated cost is £788,464. The Company will control the line, but after five years the railways have the option of expropriating it. This line will bring Johannesburg 312 miles from Kimberley, the present line via De Aar being 661 miles, and also reduces the distance to Port Elizabeth by 153 miles.

The first-class fare from Cape Town to Pretoria is 9l. 14s. 4d., 100lbs. luggage free; second-class, 7l. 4s. 11d., 75lbs. free.

**Agriculture.**

A Lands Department was established in 1902, and deals with the acquisition of land for the purposes of settlement, the importation of cattle for re-stocking, and the various subjects important to scientific farming. A sum of £1,200,000 has been appropriated from loan funds to land settlement, of which about £500,000 has been spent on the purchase of land, and £250,000 on the purchase of stock and equipment and in loans to settlers. The year 1903-4 was more favourable to farmers than the preceding year, abundant rain falling in the summer months.

**Local Government.**

A Municipal Corporations Ordinance was enacted in 1903, which entrusted the local authorities with extensive powers. Interference by the Government is practically limited to the powers of audit. The basis of qualification is the ownership of real property to the value of 100l., or the tenancy of premises of the value of 300l., or annual value of 24l., but the franchise is not extended to aliens or to coloured British subjects. Great progress in the improvement of the towns has already been made.

**Education.**

At the end of 1903 there were 373 primary schools, with 24,972 scholars. There are 14 provincial fee-paying schools, and high schools at Johannesburg and Pretoria.

**Finances.**

The following are the figures of the revenue and expenditure of the late S.A.R. for the years 1887 to 1898:

| Year | Receipts | Expenditure |
|------|----------|-------------|
|      | £ s. d.  | £ s. d.     |
| 1887 | 668,443  | 721,073     |
| 1888 | 884,440  | 770,492     |
| 1889 | 1,577,445| 1,226,135   |
| 1890 | 1,229,060| 1,531,461   |

The accounts of the Colony begin practically with the year 1902-3.

| Year | Receipts | Expenditure |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1902-3| £4,683,206| £5,863,062 |

These figures are the ordinary receipts and expenditure, and do not include extraordinary amounts—such as, on the one hand, contributions from the Orange River Colony and the Imperial Government, and, on the other, expenditure from loans and on services provided for by Imperial grants.

| Year | Receipts | Expenditure |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1903-4| £4,423,212| £4,378,204 |

This revenue does not include a sum of £788,592 received from the Government of Natal in connection with ceded territory and the Buffalo-Vryheid Railway; and the expenditure does not include the compensation, £220,000, paid to the Hatherley Distillery Company for cancellation of concession, which sum it is considered should, for purposes of comparison, be deemed extraordinary expenditure, but it includes the contribution of £750,000 to the Inter-Colonial Council. In addition to the ordinary revenue issues, there were the following loan expenditure issues:

- Land Settlement: £354,624
- Public Works: £251,683
- Telegraphs: £84,697
- Issues against Imperial Grants: £2,195,421
- Balance of Imperial Grant-in-aid transferred to Inter-Colonial Council: £662,201

Total: £3,548,626

Taking into account with the above the loans receipts and issues, there was on the 30th June, 1904, a balance of £235,169.

During Mr. Chamberlain's stay in Johannesburg, an arrangement was made between him and a large representative body of the colonists that a loan of £35,000,000 should be issued, guaranteed by the Imperial Government, and secured on the general revenue of the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies, bearing interest at 3½% per annum, with a sinking fund of 1½%. It was understood that the proceeds of this loan would be used for the extinction of liabilities, the purchase of public works and railways, and other local requirements. It was further understood that a further loan of £30,000,000, bearing interest at 4%, should be issued, and that the proceeds of this loan should be paid to the Imperial Government as a contribution towards the cost of the war. This issue was to take place in three instalments of £10,000,000 each, at an interval of at least twelve months between each, and the first instalment was to be raised about January, 1904, the success of this issue being guaranteed by certain South African firms. The loan was to be a charge on the general revenue of the Transvaal.

The necessary legislation having been passed in the Imperial Parliament and the local Legislature,
the first of these loans, to the extent of 30,000,000£, was issued (at par) in May, 1903. Throughout this year, however, there was considerable depression in the Colony, and, as this state of things continued, His Majesty's Government have not pressed for the raising of the second or war loan.

The balance of the 30,000,000£ loan (5,000,000£) was raised about the middle of 1904. This loan was put up to tender, and realised an average price of 98£ 10s. 3d. By that time the whole of the first issue had been practically expended, counting in the amounts ear-marked for definite impending liabilities—such as the redemption of the shares of the Netherlands Railway Company. The allocation of the loan funds is in round figures as follows:

The heavy task of repairing the ravages of war and relieving the necessities of all classes of people in the new Colonies was dealt with from four funds, viz:

1. The 3,000,000£ mentioned in the Terms of Surrender, and paid as a free grant from Imperial funds.
2. 5,000,000£ appropriated for "repatriation and compensation" from the guaranteed loan. Both of these funds were fully spent by the middle of 1904, and a debit of about 600,000£ incurred; the expenditure had, however, almost ceased, and it is anticipated that the debit will eventually be extinguished by the repayment for supplies made in excess of the 3,000,000£.
3. 2,000,000£ allotted to compensation to "British subjects, foreign subjects, and natives." This, like (1), was a free grant from Imperial funds. More than half of it was paid by the 30th April, 1904, to persons who had suffered losses from the war, at the rate of 13s. 4d. in the pound on their assessed losses, and it is anticipated that the final instalment will bring the rate up to 17s. 4d., a very remarkable degree of compensation. 200,000£ has been provisionally set aside for natives.
4. 2,000,000£ paid by the War Office for disbursement to the "protected burghers," being men to whom the military authorities had incurred some special obligation.

To this was added a further sum of 2,500,000£ to discharge the military receipts given during the war. This must be distinguished from the previous funds, as it was required for the payment of debts which formed part of the expenses of the war; the payments, however, in common with those under the previous heads, assisted the people to re-build, re-stock, and make a fresh start in their occupations. The amount actually paid has slightly exceeded the 2,500,000£.

Thus the total amount provided for relief was 14,500,000£, of which 2,500,000£ was in payment for goods received.

When the guaranteed loan was about to be issued, several difficulties arose as to the allocation of the proceeds, as there were various matters in which both of the new Colonies were interested, and it was accordingly decided to treat the railways as the joint property of the two Colonies, and to establish a common fund for that and the like common services. For these purposes the Inter-Colonial Council was constituted. (See under "South Africa.") The revenue expenditure of this body for the year 1903-04 was 2,586,548£, the principal items being 1,203,575£, for the services of the guaranteed loan, and 1,317,755£ for the South African Constabulary, which consists of about 5,000 men. Towards this expenditure the Council had a revenue 1,617,254£ from the railways. There was also a revenue of 99,825£ from interest on advances out of guaranteed loan funds. This total revenue being insufficient by about 850,000£, the two Colonies were required to contribute the latter sum, and the two contributions, which under the Order in Council (unless the Secretary of State decides otherwise) are to be in proportion to their respective customs receipts for the preceding year, were 750,000£ from the Transvaal, and 100,000£ from the Orange River Colony.

The Transvaal stood before the outbreak of war at the head of the gold-producing countries of the world.

The production, which in 1887 amounted to a value of 169,401£, rose steadily, until in 1898 it reached 4,555,022 oz., of a value of 16,044,135£. The following are the values for recent years:

| Year | Value     |
|------|-----------|
| 1893 | £5,480,498 |
| 1894 | 7,667,152  |
| 1895 | 8,569,555  |
| 1896 | 8,603,821  |
| 1897 | 10,583,616 |
| 1898 | 15,141,376 |
| 1901 | 1,014,687  |
| 1902 | 7,179,074  |
| 1903 | 12,146,307 |
| 1904 | 15,520,329 |

Almost the whole production is from the reef, the alluvial gold being inconceivable in amount. In 1897, 65 per cent. was obtained by crushing and 34 per cent. by chemical processes. In the same year the average production of gold per ton was 39·79 shillings, and the average number of persons employed was 9,530 whites and 69,127 natives. These numbers rose to 12,000 and 107,000 just before the war in 1899, but then fell to about 10,000 and 45,000 in December, 1902, with 48 mines crushing, and 3,000 stamps running; in
December, 1903, the whites numbered 12,702 and the natives 73,622. The wages in 1903 were from 9s. 5d. to 11s. a day for white labourers, and 42s. 5d. monthly for natives, who are also provided with housing and food, the latter at a cost of about 12s. a month. In July, 1904, there were 1,382 Chinese employed, and by December this number had risen to about 23,000.

The main reef on the Witwatersrand, continuously traced, measures about 62 miles, and between 1887 and end of 1904 produced about 124,000,000l. of gold. Since the British occupation great activity has been displayed in boring operations, especially in the far eastern and western extensions of the Rand; but in the outside districts prospecting is for promising quartz or other surface indications. Considerable prospecting for diamonds is being carried on in the Pretoria district, and the Premier mine, about 20 miles north-east of Pretoria, is producing at the rate of 49,349 carats per month (67,865l.).

In 1903 the output of coal was 2,533,677 tons, valued at 877,976l.
