NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Trusan River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with all the islands within a distance of three leagues, including those of Banggi and Balambangan; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), Lahat Dato, and Tawao, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. Inland stations are at Labuk, Kotabelud, Tuaran, Tambunan, Kaningau, Fort Birch, and Beaufort.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, pepper, etc.

The mineral resources of the country are now being fully investigated. Gold has been found in three of the rivers on the east coast; coal, manganese, and other minerals have also been met with, and are about to be worked.

The country is mountainous. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,700 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 120,000, are mainly Bruneis, Illanuns, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the interior they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt, clearing fresh jungle every year; the Muruts, another interior tribe, are very numerous and peaceable, occasionally varying more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting raids on a petty scale.

There are Chinese settlements on the coast; they cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. There are 200 Europeans and 16,000 Chinese in the territory. Sandakan, the chief town with suburbs, has a population of 9,500. There are two missions, one the Church of England, with stations at Kudat and Jesselton and Beaufort, and one Roman Catholic, with four stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1550, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as British North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British
North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 120 inches, according to situation.

Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce and much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco, for which the soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited. The value of tobacco exported in 1902 was over one million dollars. Coconut plantations are rapidly increasing in number, and the export of coconuts and of copra is becoming of importance. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper and tea. The enormous virgin forests of North Borneo have enabled a lucrative timber trade to be carried on with China and Manila, and inquiries for railway sleepers are now coming from various parts of the world. Sleepers have already been supplied to Manila, and it is believed that this trade can be largely developed. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay, where two large saw mills have been working for some years. The Cutch factory is doing a considerable business.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, cutch, &c., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent. pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent. and 5 cent. pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $380,000. American, Mexican, Hong Kong, and British dollars are treated as currency. There are agencies of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, and the National Bank of China, and the Company itself does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are 10 provinces (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, Myburgh, and Clarke).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British Colonies, and an Imam's court, for the administration of Muhammadan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 650 armed police under European officers.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Behn Meyer & Co. run steamers constantly between Singapore and the local ports, and between Hong Kong and the ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government have constructed a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Beaufort, 20 miles, and from Beaufort to Jesselton, 57 miles, and are constructing a line of 33 miles to Tenom, which will open up the interior, and of which 30 miles are completed. Over 600 miles of telegraph line are open. Several riding roads already exist, and 200 miles of bridle path are in course of construction. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about thirty days. Postage from Sandakan to all places outside the territory for letters 4 cents, per oz.

The postal business has considerably increased during the last few years. Statistics for 1897-1901 are as follows:

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakol. A telegraph line from that point to Sandakan is now constructed, and brings a number of inland stations into direct telegraphic communication with London.

A branch line from Beaufort, on the Padas River, to Kudat, on the west coast, is now open, and also a line from Lamag, on the Kinabatangan River, to Lahat Datoh.

SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 41,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 500,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baran River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1885 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, and the transfer was approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in August, 1891. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born June, 1829; married 1869, Margaret Alice Lily de Windt), is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868.

Heir, Charles Vyner Brooke (Rajah Muda), born 26th September, 1874.

Products.

At Paku, in Upper Sarawak, a considerable number of Chinese are engaged in working gold, and also in the Batang Luper Residency. Gold exported 1898, value $23,685; 1899, $541,711; 1900, $843,709; 1901, $1,424,170; 1902, $1,368,360, and gold ore, $22,470; 1903, $1,784,600, and gold ore, $26,380. The Borneo Company possesses a monopoly of the mineral rights, other than gold and coal, over most of Sarawak, and at Busch the Company have extensive antimony works, and have erected at Bau and Bidi large works for the treatment of gold ore by the cyanide process. Coal is mined on a considerable scale at Sadong and Broeketon, the output in 1902 being 33,278 tons, including the quantity used by the local steamers. There is a considerable export of timber mostly from the Rejang River to Hong Kong, valued in 1902 at $188,445, and in 1903 at $53,664. There are successful plantations of coffee on Matang and at Satap, and pepper grows well throughout the Territory. All these articles figure in the list of exports, which also includes diamonds, quicksilver, gutta-percha, indiarubber, canes, rattans, camphor, bees' wax, birds' nests, sago, tapioca, gambier, and silver. The value of the principal exports in 1903 was: Gutta and india-rubber, $390,000; "Jelutong gutta," $582,544; rattans, $187,000; gambier, $311,568; pepper, $2,733,301; sago flour $766,463. The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 32', E. long. 110° 28'), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses an excellent hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 100 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baran Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang.

Communication

is maintained by the Sarawak and Singapore SS. Co. with Kuching and Singapore every week; by a Government vessel with Sadong, Broeketon, and Singapore occasionally; by the "Kaka," 250 tons, and "Adeh," 189 tons, coasting, with trips to Singapore four or five times a year; and by the "Alice Loraine" fortnightly coasting service.

Communication is also kept up with coast stations by Government steam launches.

There are roads only around the capital and thence to the mining district in Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles); internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.
