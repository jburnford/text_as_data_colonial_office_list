CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane (Támaparánú, the Island of "dusky leaves"), is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustán, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 51' N. lat. and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangamankande on the east. Its area is 25,331½ square miles, (16,212,480 acres) or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Málédive Archipelago, 400 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000, the people being well governed, and energetic traders and seamen. Mali, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustan. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual mean rainfall is about 87-83 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November, but there is hardly a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.

History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

Constitution.

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

Defence.

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the European garrison, the strength being 2,982 men. The Colonial contribution for 1903 was Rs. 1,912,109. It is fixed by ordinance at 9½ per cent. of the general revenue (less land sales and railway charges), but is never to exceed three-fourths of the cost of the garrison. Trincomalee is a fortified naval station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard. Colombo harbour is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments, and is approaching completion.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of December, 1903, consisted of 2,592 of all ranks.

Population, Area, and Statistics.

According to decennial census, taken on the 1st March, 1901, the population is 3,576,990, an increase of 18·7 per cent. on the population enumerated in 1891. The details of the population are as follows (including the military, shipping, estates, and 4,913 Boer prisoners of war):

| Province                        | Population |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Western Province                | 925,212    |
| Central ditto                   | 622,832    |
| Northern ditto                  | 342,109    |
| Southern ditto                  | 566,690    |
| Eastern ditto                   | 174,156    |
| North-Western Province          | 353,703    |
| North-Central ditto             | 79,101     |
| Province of Uva                  | 191,925    |
| Province of Sabaragamuna        | 321,252    |
| **Total**                       | **3,576,990** |

Among these are about 9,000 Europeans, 23,000 Burghers and Eurasians, 225,000 Moormen, 11,000 Malays, 2,334,000 Sinhalese, and 955,000 Tamils. The Buddhists number more than half the population, there are about 750,000 Hindus, 260,000 Mohammedans, and 360,000 Christians (mostly Catholic). The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 158,093; Kandy, 26,522; Galle, 37,326; Jaffna, 33,860; Negombo, 19,949; Kalutara, 11,499; Moratuwa, 29,133; Matara, 11,846; Trincomalee, 11,793; Batticaloa, 10,044; Kurunegala, 6,486; Badulla, 5,924.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea and coffee estates, &c., is about 400,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 440,000.

Rather more than one-fifth of the area of the Colony, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level.

The most important products are:

| Product       | Acres   |
|---------------|---------|
| Rice          | 647,910 |
| Other Grain   | 109,962 |
| Coffee        | 19,023  |
| Tea           | 424,856 |
| Cinchona      | 749     |
| Cocoanuts     | 864,296 |
| Cinnamon      | 46,117  |
| Tobacco       | 11,127  |
| Cocoa         | 33,260  |

There are 1,692 plumbago mines and pits in the island, giving an aggregate yield of 379,415 cwt.s of mineral every year, the value of which may be roughly estimated at over Rs. 3,670,000. There are 412 gem quarries.
The pearl fisheries, for which Ceylon is famous, and which are in the hands of the Colonial Government, are carried on at intervals of years along the banks which fringe the west coast of the Island.

The upset price of Crown land varies from ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt in 1903 was Rs. 1,213,680. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton Dickorya, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Ratnapura, and Kegalla, amounted in 1903 to Rs. 3,224,779.

The municipal debt on 31st December, 1903, was 403,020 rupees. Of this amount 175,961 rupees is the balance unpaid out of a loan of 250,000 rupees for the construction of waterworks at Kandy; and 58,756 rupees balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle in 1890 for the construction of waterworks.

It has been found that tea is more generally adapted to different soils and altitudes than coffee, which, moreover, is subject to coffee-leaf disease. The value of coffee exported in 1903 was Rs. 508,410, of cinchona Rs. 12,030, and of tea Rs. 58,198,622. The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Exports 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1886, 7,849,888 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,759,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; 1894, 85,376,322 lbs.; 1895, 98,581,060 lbs.; 1896, 110,093,193 lbs.; 1897, 114,466,318 lbs.; 1898, 122,395,517 lbs.; 1899, 129,661,908 lbs.; 1900, 149,264,602 lbs. of tea were exported in 1900, 144,275,608 lbs. in 1901; 150,829,707 lbs. in 1902; and 149,227,236 in 1903. The other exports are coconut oil, kernels, coir, copra, and desiccated cocoanut, cacao, cinnamon, cardamoms, citronella, oil, plumbago, tobacco, and cinchona bark.

The exports are mainly to the United Kingdom, some going however to India, the United States, the Continent of Europe, and Australia. The imports are mainly rice from India, and textiles and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requesta, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Gamabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1903 was 60,823, in schools aided by Government 137,631, and in unsided schools 39,805.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was Rs. 1,038,652.92. In 1868, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local effort, as, owing to retrenchment, the Department has been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid High Schools. One Government scholarship of 200L per annum for 4 years, to be spent at an English University, is awarded annually.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are 36. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893.

A Government Training College for Masters in English Schools was opened in 1903.

There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the General Medical Council and by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Senior and the Junior. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A licence to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Senior department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. The members of the Junior department, after a training of two years, and after passing the prescribed examination, are qualified to serve as apothecaries and vaccinators. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 129 students attending during the year 1902, of whom 96 (89 males and 7 females) belonged to the Senior, and 32 (29 males and 3 females) to the Junior department, and one casual student.

The Government maintains 64 hospitals, exclusive of 22 infectious hospitals, 20 jail hospitals, and two asylums, one for lunatics of 476 beds, and the other for lepers of 332 beds. There are
special institutions for diseases of women, and for the eye, ear and throat. There is a Bacteriological Institute. There are 341 dispensaries, 64 of which are attached to hospitals, the remaining 277 are institutions independent of hospitals. In addition there are 126 private estate dispensaries which receive free drugs from the Government.

The Ceylon Civil Medical Department consists of one Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals who is also Principal of the Medical College, Assistant Principal Civil Medical Officer, and Inspector-General of Hospitals, one Registrar of College, 75 officers having British qualifications, 3 with Calcutta degrees, 2 with Madras degrees, 3 ladies, 44 with licences to practise granted by the Ceylon Medical College, 249 apothecaries, 7 inspectors of vaccination, and 108 vaccinators, including 4 females. There are two institutions where nurses are trained, and the nursing staff consists of 4 European qualified nurses, 23 European Roman Catholic sisters (untrained), 3 European Anglican sisters (untrained), 1 European matron (untrained), 27 matrons and 45 nurses trained locally.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1903 to rs. 1,638,669-28. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 523,163-72. The receipts, which included cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, etc., amounted to rs. 230,517-12. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estates Branch of the Department yielded rs. 140,022-09.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency and sovereigns, gold having been made a legal tender at the fixed rate of rs. 15 per sovereign in 1901. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pice. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 31st August, 1904, was rs. 12,651,095. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The Ceylon Government calculates the rupee at 1s. 10½d. for the purpose of the payment in the United Kingdom of half salary or pension, in the case of officers appointed from the United Kingdom before the 19th Feb., 1897; and at 1s. 6d. in the case of officers appointed after that date.

Exchange compensation has for some years been granted to officers domiciled in the United Kingdom, i.e., an allowance in rupees in respect of one-half, and one-half only, of an officer's salary, sufficient to make up the difference between the market value of the rupee, which has been fixed at 1s. 4½d., and 1s. 6d.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1889, and the two together had on 31st December, 1903, rs. 5,914,868 deposited.

Public Works.

The Colombo South-West Breakwater was commenced in 1875, and was completed in 1885. A single arm, composed of large concrete blocks on a rubble foundation running from the shore, a distance of 4,200 feet in a northerly direction, terminates with a slight curve.

In 1898 a North-East Breakwater, a North-West Breakwater, and the reclamation of 26 acres on the east side of the Harbour were sanctioned, and work in connection with these commenced in May, 1894.

The North-East Breakwater is a rubble embankment, 1,100 feet long, in a westerly direction, with an entrance 700 feet wide between it and the North-West Breakwater.

The North-West Breakwater is similar in construction to the South-West Breakwater, 2,655 feet long, in a south-westerly direction.

The total expenditure on the Harbour from 1873 is rs. 31,042,771. The area of the harbour is about 840 acres (1 square mile) and the depth up to 40 feet at low water. The construction of a graving dock is in progress. The patent slip has been completed.

Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a great reservoir at Labugama, 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoir at Maligakanda, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was rs. 4,330,000. A partial duplication of the main has been completed at a cost of about 700,000 rupees. The duplication of the remaining portion was taken in hand in 1903, and is expected to be completed in 1905.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—1,519 miles of line, comprising 2,721 miles of wire, are open in Ceylon.

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:—Broad Gauge (5ft. 6in.), Colombo to Bandarawela (160½ miles), Polgahawela to Kurunegala (13 miles). Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21 miles), Ragama Junction to Mahara Quarry (14 miles), Colombo to Matara (98½ miles), Fort Junction to Wharf (1¼ miles), Kankesanturai to Pallai (34½ miles). Narrow Gauge (2ft. 6in.), Colombo to Tiatantota (47¾ miles), Nanuoya to Kandapola (12¾ miles). The remainder of the last named narrow gauge line from Kandapola to Ragalla (6¾ miles), and also a further section of the Northern Extension (Broad Gauge) from Kurunegala to Anuradhapura (68 miles) will probably be opened in 1904. The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1903, charged in accounts, was rs. 66,847,026. The receipts during 1902 were rs. 8,338,614, and expenditure rs. 4,603,440.

Total mileage open at the end of 1903—391½ miles.

Of metalled roads there are 2,662-33 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 679-06 and 349-98 miles respectively; of canals 152-27 miles. The maintenance of 3,588-93 miles of road cost, in 1904, rs. 1,753,731, or an average rate of rs. 475 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works.
Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees collect the commutation, but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new waterworks.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia. 2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles, Ceylon, Straits and China, and India, by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes. 3. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. 4. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Navigation Company. 4. A fortnightly service by the steamers of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company between Europe and China and Ceylon. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia and China by these steamers. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 14 to 16 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 5, 5, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, which is carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company.

Letters, etc., from England reach Colombo in about 16 days (14) minimum, 17½ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the Clan Line, the City Line, Anchor Line, Compania Transatlantica, Holt's, &c. The steamers of the first leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.
