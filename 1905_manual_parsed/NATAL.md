NATAL.

Situation and Area.
The Colony of Natal* derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange River Colony and Basutoland, and on the south by the Cape Colony and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,306† square

* There was formerly another British settlement named Natal, a factory of the East India Company on the west coast of Sumatra, founded 1751, and not finally abandoned until the cession of Sumatra to the Dutch in 1824.

miles, and has a seaboard of 376 * miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of 34,676; the largest town and only port in Durban, with 79,000 inhabitants, of whom 30,000 are natives and 15,000 Indians, and other Asiatics.

**History.**

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage endeavoured to colonise it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Chaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the Transvaal and Orange Free States on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other, Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

**Zululand and Amatongaland.**

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Chaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Chaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingaan in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Panda. In the latter years of Panda Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetywayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in
command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hloblani Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlovo on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetywayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatusi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatusi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus, finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinizulu, a son of Cetywayo, as king; but it was soon checked, and Dinizulu and some of his indunas were removed to St. Helena, while others were imprisoned or fined. Dinizulu and his two uncles Ntabuko and Ishingana were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1888.

In 1890 the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Umbegiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Amatongaland, also called Amapataland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongola with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Amatongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and the Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the three Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, and Paupietersburg. The population is estimated at 9,447 Europeans, and 70,876 Natives, and 90 Asiatics. This territory represents an area of 6,970 square miles.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council...
of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

The Ministry as at present constituted consists of:

- Prime Minister, who is also Treasurer,
- Colonial Secretary,
- Minister of Justice, also Minister of Education,
- Minister of Lands and Works,
- Secretary for Native Affairs,
- Minister of Agriculture,

all of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of thirteen members, is summoned by the Governor in Council. The members are summoned from the following districts of the Colony—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umvoti; three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; one from the Province of Zululand; and one from the New Territory; but not more than two members may be chosen from within any one county.

Each member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immovable property within the Colony of the value of 500l. in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 43 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors, chosen by the electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 17 in the Colony. The number of electors registered in 1903 was 18,774.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election, the qualifications of electors, and to all other matters concerning elections, in force at the time of the passing of the Act, apply to the election of Members to serve in the Legislative Assembly. Under the Act No. 10 of 1898, provision is made for the Parliamentary representation of the Province of Zululand.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Constitution Act (No. 14, 1893), includes 2,900l. for pensions to officers retired on account of the change in the Constitution, and also 8,200l. for the salaries of the Governor and Ministers, 600l. for an Under Secretary for Native Affairs, and 10,000l. for the promotion of the welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more than two miles from the seat of Government receive 1l. per day travelling allowance. The session is usually from April to July or August.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or is in receipt of rents from property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to vote.

Local Government.

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee, and local boards in Verulam and Greytown. Their total revenue in 1903 was 527,633l., their expenditure, 634,090l., and their debt 2,638,696l.

Native Affairs.

In 1872, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime mala in se. The native population was debarred from the franchise, but by an Act, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law, in which case he was entitled to all the rights of an ordinary colonist.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1896, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work as well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. A white Magistrate was formerly placed with every tribe, who was the administrator of justice in civil matters, and superseded to a considerable extent the authority of the chiefs. The tribes live apart upon locations provided for them by the Government. But besides these location natives there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular
labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875 a tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law 41, 1884, a rent of 1/2 per hut is imposed upon natives living on Crown lands.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is 2,198,456 acres, besides about 183,069 acres held by religious missions.

Estimated Number of Natives living in (about) Locations 235,000
Do. do. Mission Reserves 30,000
Do. do. Crown Lands 19,000
Do. do. Private do. 299,000
Do. do. Zululand 223,000

With the exception of the District of Provis B, which is occupied by Boer farmers, and the townships of Melmoth, Osborn, Nondweni and Eshowe, all the lands in the Province of Zululand are vested in the Crown.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies, but is usually mild, cool, and bright. On the coast it is semi-tropical.

The rainy season is from October to March inclusive, during which thunderstorms are frequent and severe. There is no malaria in the colony. The death rates at Pietermaritzburg and Durban for 1903 were 17·51 and 14·79 per thousand respectively.

About 84 per cent. of the inhabitants are Zulu natives, and about 7·6 per cent. are Indian coolies. The Europeans number 82,542, or 7·9 per cent., of whom about 12,000 are Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 1,500 colonists of German descent in the New Hanover and Lower Umzimkulu divisions.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with England (22 days), with the Cape and Inland Colonies daily, with Mauritius and East Coast ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.) once or twice a month, with Delagoa Bay six times a month or more frequently, with Australia fortnightly, and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. Steamers pass between Natal and Table Bay every week, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth, and Mossel Bay. There are also two direct lines of steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is about 26 days. Two mail and passenger trains leave daily for Cape Town via Johannesburg, the distance being accomplished in 72 hours.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally.

The rates of postage are:

There are 1,722 miles of Government telegraphs constructed at a cost of about 176,194l., and the earnings for the year 1903 were 58,242l. (exclusive of the value of Government messages, 12,929l.), and the expenses, 171,537l. (including Post Offices).

Natal Government Railways.

Statistical Summary as at 31st December, 1903.

There are 762 miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government, with the exception of the North Coast extension beyond Verulam to Tugela (50 miles), which was constructed by the Natal-Zululand Railway Company, and an extension of 98 miles from Tugela to Somkele (Hlabisa Coalfields), constructed by Mr. Thomas Reynolds, both of which are worked by the Government, on behalf of the constructors, in accordance with working agreements.

The main line extends from the Port of Durban to Pietermaritzburg (the capital of the Colony, 70 miles inland), and thence to Charlestown, on the border of the Transvaal (306 miles distant from the port), where it connects with the line to Johannesburg and Pretoria.

A branch line runs from Thornville Junction (50½ miles from the port) to Richmond (17 miles), and from Pietermaritzburg a branch connects Greytown with the City (64½ miles).

A branch to Harrismith in the Orange River Colony, from the main line at the 1903 milepost, was opened on the 12th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59½ miles, 23½ of which run through the Orange River Colony.

A branch line runs from Glencoe Junction (231½ miles distant from the port), tapping the Dundee Coalfields, and thence to Vryheid (59½ miles), the Capital of the territory of the late Zululand Republic, recently added to the Colony of Natal.

An extension of the line from Harrismith to Bethlehem (about 60 miles) is in course of construction, and will shortly be opened for traffic, and worked by the Central South African Railways. The section from Van Reenen to Harrismith was purchased by the Transvaal as from the 1st December, 1903, but will in the meantime, under arrangement, continue to be worked by Natal.

A branch extends northwards from Durban to Somkele (167½ miles), in the Province of Zululand.

Another branch runs from South Coast Junction to North Shepstone (77 miles), and places in touch with the town of Durban a portion of the Colony which has large natural resources. This district contains valuable lime and marble deposits.

A line runs from the South Coast Branch at Alexandra Junction to Umtinto, 6½ miles distant, and serves an important sugar-growing area.

A further branch connecting the main line with the Bluff side (Wests) goes out from Clairmont on the South Coast Line, and is 6½ miles in extent.

* Letter postage to the U.K., India, and to other Colonies and countries which joined the Penny Post agreement, was reduced to 1½d. per ½ oz. from the 25th Dec., 1896. (See end of Introduction.)
The work of railway construction was begun in January, 1876, and the sections then authorised were completed in December, 1880. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 114 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the last, which completes the main line to Charlestown, on the border of the Transvaal, was opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was opened on the 1st December, 1896.

Work upon the new connection with Cape Colony, which will effect its junction at Riverside on the Griqualand East boundary, a distance of 100 miles from Maritzburg (the Natal Trunk Line junction), has been commenced, and the first section of about 37 miles will shortly be opened for general traffic.

The total cost of construction of the railways up to the end of 1903 was 10,543,179L. The receipts for 1903 were 2,561,552L., and the expenditure 1,791,108L. The net receipts were equal to 7L. 6s. 180L. per cent. upon the capital expended on open lines.

In addition to the railways owned and worked by the Natal Government there are two private lines in Natal. The Tea Estates of Messrs. J. L. Hulett and Sons, Ltd., are served by a 2 feet narrow gauge railway which branches off from Stanger Station, and is 8 miles in length. The ruling gradient of the railway is 1 in 30.

The Lower Illovo Sugar Estate, situated on the south coast about 22 miles from Durban, possesses a 2 feet narrow gauge line 8 miles in length. The grades vary from 1 to 4:31 in 100.

Defence.

There was, in 1903, an Imperial garrison quartered at Pietermaritzburg, Howick, and Mooi River, consisting of one regiment of cavalry, six batteries of artillery and two infantry battalions, besides detachments of the usual departmental corps. The total strength of the Imperial Forces in Natal, 1903, was 1,150 infantry, 6 batteries artillery—710, 620 cavalry, and details about 200. Total 2,680 men.

The volunteer force of the Colony has been converted into a militia, is partially paid, and is divided into a naval corps of 199 men, about 2,000 mounted riflemen, 3 field batteries of 300, a composite regiment of about 300 men, including a battery of 6 15-pounder B.L. guns, and an infantry battalion of 531 men; total, 3,197 of all ranks (1903). The whole force is fully equipped and armed with modern weapons.

The Colony also maintains an armed and mounted police force, numbering 954 Europeans, fully equipped and available for field service. The volunteers and police were on active service for over 12 months during the Boer War (1899-1902). Since the beginning of 1903 volunteering received a great impetus, owing to the passing of the Militia Act; and in September of that year the total number of all ranks was about 2,700.

Military training is compulsory on all boys over 10 years attending the Government schools. They are organised in cadet corps, and numbered 2,712 at end of 1903. There is also a senior cadet corps, formed during 1904, composed of youths who have left school of from 16 to 20 years of age, and numbering some 320. In addition to this, members of rifle associations are liable to be called out for defence purposes.

The Port of Durban is defended by batteries armed with modern heavy guns.

Industry.

The chief exports are wool, sugar, tea, hides, skins, horns, coal, maize, hair, wattle bark, fruit and tobacco.

There was a large transit trade with the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal previous to the war, which, it is thought, will be enormously increased now that the war is over. The harbour of Durban, which has a bar at its entrance, has been much improved by the works of the Harbour Department, and by dredging. The average depth at low water, for 1903, was 21ft. 3½in. The largest ships are now able to come in and go out at all times with perfect safety. It is a port of registry, having in 1903 33 vessels, with a total tonnage of 2,241 tons (net), in addition to a number of tugs and dredgers owned by Government. The main industry of the Colony is, however, agriculture, large numbers of cattle and sheep being reared, and large crops of maize and sugar raised. The land under cultivation amounted in 1903 to 768,268 acres.

The coal-mining industry is one that is increasing every year. The output for the last three years being:

| Year | Tons   | Value at Pit's Mouth |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| 1901 | 569,200| £549,439             |
| 1902 | 592,821| 512,574              |
| 1903 | 713,648| 418,975              |

The amount consumed by the railway department in 1903 was 206,327 tons. There is also a considerable and growing trade in bunkered and exported coal.

There were 25 out-putting collieries in 1903.

The present output is at the rate of about 800,000 tons per annum. The value of coal at the pit's mouth is about 12s. a ton, and the freight charged for railway transport is ½d. a ton per mile.

The area under sugar in 1903 was about 33,282 acres, the produce for the year 1903 being about 34,000 tons (a great portion of the sugar-cane is not crushed for sugar, but is grown for the purpose of feeding stock); that under coffee about 181 acres, yielding about 52,490 lbs. Tea, tobacco, arrowroot, wattle trees, and cayenne pepper are also grown. The area under tea in 1903 was 3,895 acres, yielding 1,761,091 lbs., and the area cultivated by natives was 486,489 acres.

The stock owned by Europeans was as follows:

Horses, 29,320; mules, 1,598; cattle (horned), 257,632; sheep, 509,978; Angora goats, 115,096; pigs, 11,630; donkeys, 1,652; ostriches, 862.

The stock owned by natives was as follows:

Horses, 24,743; cattle (horned), 365,616; sheep, 109,296; goats, 610,512; pigs, 36,992. Stock owned by Indians: Cattle, 3,479; goats, 13,250; horses, 561; pigs, 1,157; sheep, 28.

The very large decrease in the number of horned cattle is due to the ravages of rinderpest during the latter half of 1897, and, since then, to losses caused by the war, 1899-1902. The disease was stamped out, but has since reappeared in a mild form in several districts.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, and the National Bank of South Africa have together thirty-four establishments, with 4,406,721L. deposits in 1903. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1903 (December 31st) 617,246L. deposits.
Education.

In 1903 there were 440 schools under Government inspection—256 European, 161 native, and 23 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 22,929. There are 41 Government schools, and 399 Government-aided Schools. The aggregate number of pupils in regular attendance at the Government and Government-aided Schools was 17,657 (1903). The management is vested in the Minister of Education, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the financial year 1902-03, amounted to £82,881. 5s. 11d., and the revenue to £11,913l. 17s. 2d.

NEWFOUNDLAND.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 61° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Cape Chidley (Hudson's Strait) to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound; the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,700 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, and Hebron. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norsemen and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863, but has been discontinued for some years past. The Collector of Customs, who visits Labrador every summer, is a J.P.; no other administration exists.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district was resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieuc, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they are allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right is an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it does not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (See Cd. 1952). The arrangement will be of great benefit to the Colony, since it removes an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Copper is largely worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1902-3 was 1,429,274 quintals, value $5,633,072; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, and Royal Bank of Canada have been opened in St. John's, a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace, and of the Bank of Montreal at Bay of Islands.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1895) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Much of the trade is carried on by barter. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4.36s to the pound sterling.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $525,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, via Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,146,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, Carbonear, and Burnt Bay are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. The transinsular railway, now being opened, regular connection is made with the continent three times a week, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamer "Bruce," which makes the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 1,952 miles of telegraph open, and cables start for Europe (at Heart's Content) and America (at Placentia). There is a fortnightly mail service (except in February, March and April) with Liverpool by the Allan line, and at irregular intervals by other steamers. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The south and west coast has a ten days' steamer service from St. John's. One steamer makes fortnightly trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer. Smaller steamers ply on the four great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, per 1 oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|------------|
| In St. John's      | 1 cent.    | Free if under |
| Within Colony      | 3 cents.   | 4 oz.         |
| To United Kingdom  | 2          | 1 cent. for 2 oz. |
| and certain Colonies* | 5          | 1 ditto       |
| Other Colonies     |            |              |
| Europe, United States, and St. Pierre, Miquelon | 5 cents. | 1 ditto       |
| South America      | 5          | 1            |

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's in the year 1900 was 41°, the extreme range being from 2° to 84°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1899 was 47½ inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison. A branch of the Royal Naval Reserve, the first in any Colony, was established in Newfoundland in 1900, the expense of which is shared between the Imperial Exchequer and the Colony, the Government of the latter contributing £3,000 per annum towards the charge. The training-ship "Calypso" is stationed at St. John's, with a maximum number of 600 reservists. The scheme is very popular, and excellent reports have been received from the Naval authorities of the conduct and discipline of the men. In the initiatory stages of the arrangement, 50 reservists were embarked in H.M.'s ships for a six months' cruise with the North American and West Indian Squadron. The number has now been increased, and 130 men sailed in November, 1903, in H.M.'s ship "Charybdis," and H.M.'s ship "Ariadne," for that purpose. Arrangements have been made for the erection of a drill shed at Port Amherst at the entrance of St. Louis Harbour.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1903. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There were, in 1902, 786 schools, with 40,051 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and in the session of 1902 a small vote of $3,000 was passed for technical education.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 29,594 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 5,184; Twillingate has 3,542; Bona Vista 3,696; and Carbonear 3,703 inhabitants. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt down, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council.

* See end of Introduction. A new rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on the 1st January, 1899.
in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1901—51,887 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500l. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $120 each (President $240) per session. Members of the Assembly receive the following pay per session:—(1) Those living in St. John's, $200; (2) those living in the outports, $300. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a municipal council consisting of a mayor and six councillors elected by the citizens.
