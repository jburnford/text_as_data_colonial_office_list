SOUTHERN NIGERIA.

Situation and Boundaries.

(See Map under Lagos).

The Protectorate of Southern Nigeria is bounded on the North-west by the Colony of Lagos, on the North by the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, and on the North-east and East by the German territories of the Kameruns.

The Lagos boundary starts from a point on the sea beach of the Bight of Benin in latitude 5° 52' 20" and longitude 4° 57' 18" about a mile S.E. of the village of Omoluma. The boundary follows a straight line to the junction of the Lagos and the Adabressa Creek, continuing up the middle of the Opofanga, Kokotoro, Jojoboko, Kofuturo (or Siluko) Creek, thence up the middle of the Ofuso-Wena River to its junction with the Owens River, thence up the middle of the Ofuso River to its junction with its tributary the Abere, thence in a straight line to the junction of the Akure and Usho main road with the Ogbesi River.

From this point the Northern Nigeria boundary follows a line from the villages Usho, Amurin to Emure-Ile, thence to Egpeni and along the Owo road through the village of Orea and Suada to the point where that road crosses the Ogbesere stream. It then follows the course of the Ogbesere stream to its junction with the Owese River and then the course of the Owese River to the point where it crosses the Ipele-Iduani road. From here the boundary runs in a north-easterly direction through Iduani and Yaiya, thence easterly to Idogun and Ogpe, thence southerly through Itwa to Ake and on to Ushoka, from which village it proceeds in a south-easterly direction to Shebe and on through Yadu to Auashi; thence through Jattu to Uyere and in an easterly direction through Aota, Afana, Gufu and Goronti to Fuga. From Fuga the line runs to Yanegode, and thence in an easterly direction to a point about ten miles north-east of Idah on the Niger. The exact boundary north of Idah and affecting the territory immediately east of the Niger is in course of delimitation.

The boundary continues in a straight line slightly north of the 7th parallel of latitude to a point near Ashuku on the Anglo-German frontier as laid down in the Convention of 1893. From this point the boundary runs in a straight line to the rapids on the Cross River and thence to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The area of the Protectorate is estimated at 51,500 square miles.

The numerous rivers, creeks and estuaries in this part of the West African coast have received the name of the "Oil Rivers," from the fact of their producing the bulk of the palm oil, which constitutes the chief export of West Africa. The Niger has formed a huge delta with a coast line of over 200 miles from the mouth of the Benin river to Opobo. The coast district here for a long distance, varying from 20 to 40 miles inland, is a mere network of "creeks" and "Islands." Into this delta several other considerable rivers empty themselves, the chief being on the west, the Benin with its affluents, the Oase, Ologi, Jameson and Ethiope, and on the east the Imo with its affluents the Otaminne and Azumine.

The chief mouths of the Niger are at the Forcados estuary, communicating with Warri, Sapele and Benin, the Nun mouth at Akassa, and at Brass.

The Engenni, New Calabar, and Opobo Rivers enter the sea by the broad estuaries known as the Sombrero, the New Calabar, the Bonny, the Andoni, and the Opobo Rivers, and drain a fertile, undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive.

Further east is the Calabar estuary, mainly formed by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length which drains, with its affluents the Calabar, Aqua, Akpayfe and the Ndiana Rivers, the high mountain ranges running north-west from the Kamerun mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benue.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Jekri, occupying the lower part of the Benin, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Ijos, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Warri and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, where they join the Akuna-kunas, being an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle; and the Efiks and "Kwas" in the Calabar region.

History.

The British Protectorate of the Niger districts (Oil Rivers Protectorate) was announced in the London Gazette of 5th June, 1885. It extended along the West Coast of Africa from a point on the shore of the Bight of Benin about ten miles north-west of the Benin River to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger was included in the territories administered by the Royal Niger Company under their Charter of 10th July, 1886.

By an Order in Council, dated the 13th May, 1893, the Protectorate was extended under the name of the Niger Coast Protectorate, and an administration established under Sir Claude MacDonald, K.C.M.G., K.C.B., as Imperial Commissioner and Consul-General; he was succeeded in this office, in 1896, by Sir R. Moor, K.C.M.G.

On the taking over of the territories of the Royal Niger Company in 1900 the Niger Coast Protectorate was extended so as to include the part lying between Idah on the Niger and the Coast, which had been formerly administered by the Company, and the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was constituted under an Order in Council, dated the 27th December, 1899, the administration being transferred from the Foreign to Colonial Office.

Mr. Walter Egerton, C.M.G., High Commissioner, has recently been also appointed Governor of Lagos, and the amalgamation of that Colony with the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria is under consideration.

Constitution and Administration.

Under the Order in Council of 27th December, 1899, the Imperial Commissioner and Consul-General of the Niger Coast Protectorate assumed the administration of Southern Nigeria under the title of High Commissioner, with power to enact laws styled proclamations. There is no Legislative or Executive Council. On matters affecting the interests of merchants, chambers of commerce are consulted and given opportunities of expressing their views before the enactment of proclamations directly affecting commercial undertakings.
The Protectorate, for purposes of administration, is divided into five Divisions, each presided over by a Divisional Commissioner. The Divisions are further sub-divided into Districts, presided over by District Commissioners or Assistant District Commissioners, who, in addition to their judicial duties, are the executive officers in their Districts. The Divisions and Districts are as follows:

**Eastern Division.**—Districts.—Akwete, Bonny, Brass, Degama, Opobo, Owerri.

**Western Division.**—Districts.—Benin City, Forcados, Ifon, Sapele, Warri.

**Central Division.**—Districts.—Agberi, Asaba, Idah.

**Calabar Division.**—Districts.—Calabar, Eket.

**Cross River Division.**—Districts.—Afikpo, Aro-Chuku, Bende, Obubura Hill, Okuni.

The Military Force consists of the Southern Nigeria Regiment of the West African Frontier Force. The total strength of the Regiment is 46 officers, 23 British non-commissioned officers, and 1,351 rank and file. Twelve stations, in addition to headquarters, are garrisoned by troops.

The Protectorate maintains a Civil Police Force, consisting of 1 inspector, 2 assistant inspectors, and 304 rank and file. They are distributed over the Protectorate, and relieve the detachments of the Southern Nigeria Regiment in districts which are sufficiently settled not to require military occupation.

**Law and Justice.**

The Law in force is contained in the Proclamations enacted by the High Commissioner, and Civil and Criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Proclamations (1900, 1902 and 1903), the Criminal Procedure Proclamation (1900), the Commissioners’ Proclamations (1900 and 1903), the Police Magistrate Proclamation (1903), and the Native Courts Proclamations (1901 and 1903).

The Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice, holds Assizes at the principal centres. There are District Courts, with limited Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Commissioners, and there is a Police Magistrate’s Court with similar jurisdiction at Calabar.

The Supreme Court decides appeals from the inferior Courts in Civil matters, and the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decision of Commissioners in criminal cases. The Chief Justice and Puisne Judge are, *ex officio*, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Courts of Northern Nigeria and Lagos, while the Chief Justices and Puisne Judges of Northern Nigeria and Lagos are, *ex officio*, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Court of Southern Nigeria.

Native Courts have been established throughout the districts. The District Commissioner sits as President of the Court, and in his absence the Assistant District Commissioner. Under the Native Courts Proclamation, 1901, the Courts have, subject to the approval of the High Commissioner, power to make Rules providing for the peace, good order and welfare of the Natives. Native law is administered in all the Courts in so far as it is not incompatible with any Statute and not repugnant to natural justice.

**Domestic Slavery.**

A system of domestic slavery was, until recently, universally recognised—the father or the mother having the power of sale, according to their position in the “House.” The evil was aggravated by that peculiar development of the system known as “pawning,” under which a debtor could temporarily liquidate the claims of his creditor by handing over as security either himself or a child or a slave, and by the power which the creditor possessed in turn of handing over the security to his own creditors, the same “pawn” passing through the hands of numberless creditors. By the Slave-dealing Proclamation of 1901 the buying, selling, or pawning of slaves is prohibited under heavy penalties. The system has been effectually abolished in the more settled districts, and is gradually being eradicated from those under less effective control. The Native House Rule Proclamation, 1901, provides for the maintenance of the authority, which is vested in Heads of Houses by Native law and Custom, over members of the House. The law enforces the submission of members to the Head of the House, and upon the latter the performance of those obligations towards the members which native law and custom imposes.

**Climate.**

The climate, being hot and moist, is unhealthy for Europeans. The estimated European population in 1903 was 460. There were 12 deaths during the year, giving a death-rate of 26·08 per thousand, and showing a decrease of 1·14 per thousand as compared with 1902. Among European officials there was a death-rate of 12·97 per thousand, and an invaliding rate of 169·81 per thousand. Among Europeans other than officials these rates were 33·22 and 89·70 respectively. At Calabar the months during which sickness was most prevalent were February and August.

During 1903 the mean temperature at Calabar was 81·11° F., the shade maximum 85·65° F., and the shade minimum 70·64° F. For the years 1899 to 1903 the average mean temperature is 81·57° F., and the shade maximum and minimum 90·44° F., and 69·84° F., respectively.

There was at Calabar a total rainfall for the year of 140·85 inches, the greatest fall being recorded in the month of July (34·28 inches), and the lowest in March (0·92 inches). Observations at Calabar, Opobo, Bonny, Sapele, and Asaba show, for 1903, a mean rainfall of 104·94 inches. The direction of the prevailing wind is S. W.

**Trade.**

The principal articles of export are palm oil and palm kernels, rubber, lumber, ivory, gum-copal, ebony, cocoa and ground-nuts. The quantity and value of these products which were exported in 1903 is shown in the following table.

| Articles       | Quantity     | Value   |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Cocoa          | 288,614 lbs. | £3,652 14 0 |
| Coffee         | 50,342 lbs.  | 524 4 8   |
| Ebony          | 1,048 tons   | 3,742 13 2 |
| Fibre          | 5,685 pkgs.  | 3,226 2 8 |
| Gum-copal      | 671,100 lbs. | 6,413 8 10|
| Ground Nuts    | 9,363 cwt.   | 2,732 1 5 |
| Ivory          | 18,274 lbs.  | 5,735 8 10|
| Lumber (Native Timber) | 460,446 Supf.ft. | 32,027 14 0 |
| Palm Kernels   | 68,330 tons  | 526,738 1 2|
| Palm Oil...    | 12,018,075 Imp.Gs. | 629,708 17 11|
| Rubber         | 1,177,803 lbs.| 61,815 11 2|

The area of the *Funtumia Elastica* rubber plantations has been considerably increased under the Forestry Department, and some of the native chiefs are embarking upon the industry on their own account. “Root-rubber” is obtained from a
Landolphia Vine, which is widely distributed over the country, and possesses the habit of sending up root-suckers, which greatly increase its power of resistance to root-tapping. The lumber trade has been placed on a sound basis. The girth of trees which may be felled has been increased, and concessions are accordingly granted over larger areas.

Experiments in cotton growing have been made under the supervision of the British Cotton Growers' Association. The chief difficulty lies in the labour question. There is an abundant supply of unskilled labour, but it is found that to attain satisfactory results constant and careful supervision is necessary, and the people are so well off as to be adverse to regular labour.

There is an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on all articles imported into the Protectorate save those liable to specific duties, such as spirits, tobacco, gunpowder, etc., and those exempted under the Customs Tariff, such as books, building materials, coal, cooper's stores, educational apparatus, etc.

Means of Communication.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. There is a fortnightly service between Liverpool and Forcados, Bonny and Calabar. The steamers leave Liverpool on alternate Saturdays, and call at Monrovia, Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos. On the intervening Saturdays there is a service between Liverpool and Forcados. The time occupied in the voyage from Liverpool to Calabar is 20 days. These Companies also maintain intermediate services from London, Liverpool and Hamburg to Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, Brass, Akassa, Forcados, Warri, and Sapele.

Steamers of the German Woermann Line run from Calabar to Lagos in connection with that Company's Express Service between Lagos and Southampton. On the outward voyage there is no direct communication between Lagos and Calabar. Intermediate services are also maintained by the Woermann Line between Hamburg and the ports of the Protectorate.

The Niger is navigable to the Northern Nigeria Boundary for small ocean-going steamers during the months of June, July, August and September, and at other times for shallow-draught stern-wheel steamers and launches. Under the direction of the Government a Transport Department for the conveyance of passengers and cargo at fixed rates has been working on the Niger since 1902. The distance from Forcados to Idah, the Southern Nigeria boundary on the Niger, is 307 miles.

The Cross River is navigable up to and beyond the German boundary during the wet season by stern-wheel steamers and launches, but during the dry season mails and Government cargo can only be conveyed by means of canoes. The distance from Calabar to Ossidinge beyond the German boundary is about 242 miles.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, or Calabar, on the river of the same name, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of the administration, with a population of about 15,000. A Presbyterian mission is established there. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river in Bende, a great Ju Ju centre. Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church, presented by one of the native chiefs.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants. It was formerly the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and famous for human sacrifices. It was taken in 1897, in the circumstances stated below, and is now a thriving trading centre, with a British Resident and administrative staff; it is also a military post. The trading station in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea-breeze, though sandflies and mosquitoes abound.

In Jan., 1897, a peaceful mission on its way to the King of Benin was massacred in the bush, and a force of native troops and blue jackets had to be sent to punish the Binis. The expedition was completely successful, the king's forces being defeated, and the king himself driven to take refuge in the bush. The king was afterwards captured, and is now in exile at Old Calabar.

Post and Telegraph.

The Protectorate is included in the Postal Union. Foreign Money Order and Parcels Post Systems are in operation between it and the United Kingdom, Northern Nigeria, Lagos, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia. There is also an inland Money Order System. A system for the insurance of letters up to a maximum of 60l. has been inaugurated. The number of letters and postcards received and despatched from the Protectorate during the year 1903 was 742,034, and of parcels, 13,718. The operations of the Money Order branch in 1903 exceeded those of 1902 by 6,000. This increase is largely due to the Native Clerks and Artisans taking greater advantage of the Money Order System, and remitting money to their families in the West African Colonies, and also to the Natives and Native Foreigners in the Protectorate remitting to the United Kingdom money for merchandise to be sent out by parcel post, the latter showing an increase in value of 1,164l. over the year 1902.

There is telegraphic communication by submarine cable from Brass and Bonny to Europe (rate 5s. per word).

There are Government telegraph lines from Forcados to Lagos, and from Calabar, via Eket and Egwanga, to Bonny; the total mileage of Government telegraph line amounts to 1954 miles. The rate is 1d. a word, with a minimum charge of 1s.

Education.

Under the Education Proclamation of 1903 a Board of Education has been appointed, and a code of rules drawn up governing education in the Protectorate.

The system of education provides for primary and secondary schools, and a High School, at which the pupils will be given higher education of a general character, and special instruction in certain branches of industrial work.

There are 61 Churches and Chapels in the Protectorate belonging to the Church of England, United Free (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland, Irish Protestant (Undenominational), Primitive Methodist and Roman Catholic Churches. In addition to the schools attached to these churches,
primary schools have been established at Owo, Warri, Agbede and Benin City, which are maintained by Government grants, subscriptions from mercantile firms and native chiefs, and school fees. In places where it is decided to establish a primary school the chiefs contribute a sum equal to the Government grant; they give a site for the school and assist in the erection of the school buildings and quarters for the native staff. The schools are managed and the funds controlled by committees composed of local officials, representatives of mercantile firms and native chiefs.

There are intermediate schools at Bonny and at Sapele. New buildings are in course of construction for the Ogugumanga Institution at Bonny, to the cost of which contributions amounting to over 5,000l. have been given by the merchants and others.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling. There is a large demand for silver coinage, and, where European factories exist, the demand for cash steadily increases. A small importation has been made of the Imperial bronze coinage and though it is yet too soon to speak definitely of the results, there is no indication at present of any dislike to it on the part of the natives.

The native currency of brass rods and manillas is accepted as legal tender in native markets in which they had been current previous to the enactment of the Native Currency Proclamation (1902), the rates of exchange being for Brass Rods 4 to 1s., for Awirawu Manillas 6 to 1s., Abbie or Prince Manillas, 12 to 1s., and Ama-Ogono or Town Manillas, 24 to 1s.

Cowries are still extensively used as currency in some parts of the Protectorate. Their further importation is prohibited by the Cowrie Proclamation of 1904, and their use will probably cease in a few years' time.

The Anglo-African Bank has branches at Calabar and Burutu.
