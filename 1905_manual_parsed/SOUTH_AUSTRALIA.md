SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.
That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vict., c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The whole State covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, and includes an area of 903,690 square miles (equal to twice France and Germany together).

Kangaroo Island (90 m. by 25 m.; area, 1,500 sq. m., 1,000 ft. highest point), Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands, near Port Darwin, and Groote Eylandt, the Pellew Archipelago, and others in the Gulf of Carpentaria, are included in the State.

Adelaide, the capital of the State, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

History.
The south coast of the State was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Stuart in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. The South Australian Company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836. Copper was discovered 1842, by Menge. Responsible government was established in 1856. Stuart reached Port Darwin 1861, and the "Northern Territory" was added to the State in 1861 and 1863.

Climate.
The rainfall at Adelaide averages 21 inches annually, mostly from May to October. It varies from 16 to 42 inches on the plains and hills respectively. The mean temperature 74°, the extreme range being from 35° to 112°.

General Government.
The Parliament of South Australia consists of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly, created by the Local Act No. 2 of 1856-56, which was proclaimed on October 25th, 1856. This Act, commonly called the Constitution Act, was passed by virtue of the Imperial Act 13 & 14 Vict., cap. 59.

The Legislative Council and House of Assembly, as originally constituted, consisted of 18 and 36 members respectively. By the Local Act No. 27 of 1875, the House of Assembly was increased to 46 members, representing 22 electoral districts. By Act No. 236 of 1881, six members were added to the Legislative Council, and the Colony was divided into four electoral districts for the purpose of Council elections. In 1882 the House of Assembly was further increased to 52 members, representing 26 electoral districts; and by Act No. 450 of 1888, the Northern Territory was created an electoral district, returning two members, thus raising the number to 54. By Act 779 of 1901, the number of members was reduced from 31st March, 1902, to 18 in the Legislative Council and 42 (representing 13 districts) in the House of Assembly.

The four electoral districts of the Legislative Council are—Central, Southern, North-eastern, and Northern, the first returning six members and the others four members each. On May 3rd, 1905, and every three years thereafter, three members for the Central District and two members for each of the other Council Districts who stand first on the roll retire, and their successors will be appointed by each of the four districts electing members. The new members are placed at the bottom of the roll of their district, the member receiving most votes at the election being placed last. Elections are conducted by ballot. Act No. 779 of 1901 provides for a penal dissolution of the Council, or the calling up of additional members, if the Council twice reject a Bill which has been twice passed by the House of Assembly, a general election having intervened. But the dissolution or the calling up of members is permissive, not compulsory; and if members are called up no vacancies may be filled while the total number of members is 18 or more.
The quorum of the Council consists of ten members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the King, and that he has resided in the State for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have been on the electoral roll for a period of six months. He must also be possessed of either a freehold of the value of 50l. or of a leasehold of the annual value of 20l., having three years to run, or with right of purchase, or be in occupation of a dwelling-house of the annual rent value of 25l. Members of both houses are paid 200l. per annum.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; 9 Districts returning 3 members each, 2 Districts returning 4 members each, 1 District returning 5 members each, 1 District returning 2 members each. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, and have been six months on the electoral roll. The total number of electors in 1903 for the Legislative Council is 52,058, of whom 13,446 were females, and for the House of Assembly 163,587, of which about 80,049 were women. The session is usually from June to December.

The franchise for both Houses was extended to adult women by Act 613 of 1894.

Responsible government is carried on by four Ministers, members of the Legislature, who form the Cabinet, and are ex officio members of the Executive Council.

Local Government.

There are 32 municipalities in the State, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1890." The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen (Aldermen are at present elected for City of Adelaide and some of the Suburban Corporations only), and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditors. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by six ratepayers. There are also 141 district councils having somewhat similar powers. The aggregate assessment of the property within the municipal areas and District Councils amounts to 2,661,239l., and the revenue in 1903 amounted to 273,959l., and the expenditure to 275,411l.

Population.

The population of the State (including the northern territory) at the census of 1891, was 320,431 persons, and of 1901, 362,004. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are about 2,600. There are about 230 Chinese in the State. The immigration of Chinese is restricted by no vessel being allowed to enter any port or place in the State having on board a greater number of Chinese than in the proportion of one Chinese to every five hundred tons of the registered tonnage of such vessel." Penalty, on conviction, 500l. for each Chinaman in excess of such number.

"Any Chinese entering the State by land without first obtaining a permit in writing from some person to be appointed by the Governor in Council shall be liable, on conviction, to a penalty of not less than 5l., nor more than 20l.," and is also liable to be deported to the State whence he came.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide, including the suburbs, on 31st December, 1903, were estimated to number 168,066.

About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 26 per cent.

Education.

The University of Adelaide was founded by Royal Letters Patent in 1881, and an Act of the local Parliament in 1874. It was endowed by private munificence, aided by an annual grant of 5 per cent. on all sums contributed from private sources, and an endowment of land, the total amount of income being about 20,000l. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and music; the staff consists of 9 professors and 23 lecturers. All classes are open to women. It had in 1903—642 (exclusive of 352 students at the Conservatorium of Music) students, besides those attending extension lectures.

Total expenditure, 21,346l.

In connection with the Art Gallery 3 Schools of Design have been formed, in which 619 students are instructed in painting and designing for technical purposes.

The School of Mines and Industries was established in 1889. It is supported by an annual parliamentary vote of about 4,500l. and by school fees. Diplomas are awarded in mining, metallurgy, and mechanical engineering. The staff consists of 50 officers and teachers. The students number about 1,800.

Primary education is provided for by the Education Acts of 1875, 1878, and 1891, by which the management of public education is committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free from January 1, 1892, up to the compulsory standard, and it has been compulsory since 1876. There are 715 schools, with 1,320 teachers, and 61,977 scholars.

The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, &c., were, during 1903, 147,296l. The total expenditure on school buildings up to the end of 1903 was 509,990l. The lands dedicated to educational purposes amount to 409,947 acres, and the land leased was 386,981 acres, at an annual rental of 6,714l.

For the maintenance of the South Australian Public Library, Museum, and Art Gallery, also country institutes in 1903-4, the sum expended was 11,965l.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the State consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; and at Palmerston, Northern Territory, by the Judge of the Northern Territory; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court; Local Courts of Insolvency at Port Augusta.
Gladstone, Mount Gambier, and Moonta, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; and at Palmerston, Northern Territory, by the Judge of the Northern Territory; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction in all the principal towns throughout the State with full Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates, and Limited Jurisdiction, by Justices of the Peace; and Police Magistrates Courts.

The number of convictions in the Supreme Court has averaged during the last three years 121, one in every 3,014 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community. The total value of the lands brought under the operation of this law to the end of 1903 amounts to £6,515,710 sterling.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes. The amount of the Public Debt outstanding (including Northern Territory) on 31st December, 1903, was £28,162,645.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

Seven banking institutions carry on business within the State, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 96 branches and agencies. Their names are: The Bank of Australasia; Union Bank of Australia, Limited; National Bank of Australasia, Limited; English, Scottish, and Australian Bank, Limited; Bank of Adelaide; Bank of New South Wales; and Commercial Bank of Australia, Limited. The total average liabilities of the seven banks amount to (December, 1903) £6,472,887, average note circulation £30,116, and the total average assets to £6,547,447.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 154 agencies. The number of depositors on 30th June, 1904, was 141,572, and the total deposits amounted to £4,217,836. Average to credit of depositor, 3½. 0s. 10d. Rate interest paid to depositors, 3½. 10s. 0d. per cent. One in 2½ of the population is a depositor in savings banks.

Industry.

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 150,000 square miles of the area of the State excluding the Northern Territory, are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 300 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,200 miles. Forty-six counties have been proclaimed to 31st December, 1903, embracing 80,453 square miles, or 51,483,920 acres. Of this large area only 7,799,729 acres have been alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to upwards of 81 acres for each male adult in the State, 84,894,574 acres being held under lease from the Crown. About one in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to leasing, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 20,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, &c. About one-half the total area of land cultivated (3,261,063 acres) is cropped with wheat, of which 1,711,174 acres were cultivated in 1903.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry; 22,617 acres of land were devoted to this purpose in 1903. Wine made, 2,345,270 gals. Exported, 561,830 gals. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants; of the former 13,063 cwts., and of the latter, 10,406 cwts. were made in 1903.

Almond trees (178,535) are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment. Orange trees, 141,856; lemon trees, 67,882; olive trees, 80,560.

The State possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and general superiority over the imported article of commerce has secured for it a high position in the local market.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1903 there were 116,974 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 176,648; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 244,910; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 5,298,720, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 117,591 bales. The number of manufactories is 1,275, employing 18,780 hands and 8,560 horse-power.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, breweries, &c. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

The gasworks of the State are seven in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, and the remaining six are in the principal country towns. 329 vessels, of 57,596 tons, were, in 1903, registered at Port Adelaide.

Out of £5,157,519 worth of staple produce exported, the value of breadstuffs amounted to £1,110,673; while wool represented £1,326,236, and copper £47,036, and £2,303,574 other products and manufactures.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, tea, coals, hardware, and machinery. The total external trade is £14,919,724, far the larger part of which is with the United Kingdom and the
Colonies, the bulk of the remainder being with the United States and China. The chief copper mines are those at Moonta and Wallaroo; the chief gold fields, Arltunga, Angipena, Barossa, Blumberg, Echunga, Luxemburg, Mount Grainger, Mount Pleasant, Mount Torrens, Nillinghoo, Tarcoola, Teetulpa, Ulooloo, Wadnamings, Woodside, and Waukarings, and Burrundie MacDonnell Ranges in the N. T.

Means of Communication.

There are 4,520 miles of roads defined in the settled districts, the greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 2,703. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railways purchased by Government are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the State is 1,736, and 146 miles in the Northern Territory. Up to June 30th, 1904, the total cost of the railways reached £13,517,727. The receipts in 1903-4 were £1,160,639., and the expenditure £75,395. Working expenses 58½ per cent. Net revenue on cost, 3½ per cent. There is daily railway communication between Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph, some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over £50,000., across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party. An additional wire has been erected at a cost of over £50,000. At present the railway reaches Oodnadatta, 688 miles north of Adelaide, and Pine Creek, 146 miles south of Palmerston, the intervening gap being 1,200 miles.

At the close of the year 1903 there were 290 stations, 6,038 miles of line, and 14,846 miles of wire open throughout the State. There are 474 miles of telephone line open, 9 exchanges, 1,969 connections, and 4,572 miles of telephone wire. The number of messages sent in 1903 was 1,361,136, of which 152,033 were international.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia as well as with Europe and San Francisco. The rates of postage are:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| per ½ oz. | each       |
| not exceeding 10 ozs. | 2d. |
| ¼ oz.; every additional ¼ oz. | ½d. |
| United Kingdom and Postal Union Countries | 2½d. |

The total number of Post Offices, 706; letters and post cards sent and received in 1903, 22,194,784; packets, 1,984,312; newspapers, 6,374,684.

Cable rate, London to Adelaide and vice-versa, 3s. per word.

Defences.

The Commonwealth military force in the State on December 31, 1903, numbers 2,059 officers and men. The naval force consists of H.M.S. "Protector," 15 guns, with an establishment of 156 officers and men including Naval Reserve. Members Defence Rifle Clubs, 3,417. Batteries have been erected at Glanville and Largs Bay, to protect the harbour of Port Adelaide.
