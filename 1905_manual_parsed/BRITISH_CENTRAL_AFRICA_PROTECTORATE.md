BRITISH CENTRAL AFRICA PROTECTORATE.

(See Map under South Africa—Rhodesia.)

The boundaries of British Central Africa, as defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement, are a line starting from the eastern shore of Lake Nyasa at the point of the parallel of the confluence of the Rivers Rovuma and Msimje, and following the shore southwards as far as 13° 30' S. lat., whence it runs S.E. to the eastern shore of Lake Chiuta, which it follows; thence in a direct line to the eastern shore of Lake Chilwa, or Shirwa, which it follows to its south-easternmost point; thence in a direct line to the easternmost affluent of the River Ruo, and thence along that affluent, and subsequently the centre of the channel of the Ruo to its confluence with the River Shiré.

From the confluence of the Ruo and Shiré the boundary follows the centre of the channel of the latter river to a point just below Chiwanga, and thence due west to the watershed between the Zambezi and the Shiré, and follows the watershed between those rivers, and afterwards between the former river and Lake Nyasa, until it reaches south latitude 14°.

From thence it runs south-west to the point where south latitude 15° meets the River Aroangwa or Loangwa, and follows the mid-channel of that river to its junction with the Zambezi.

On the west the line follows the centre of the channel of the Upper Zambezi, starting from the Katima rapids up to the point where it reaches the territory of the Barutse Kingdom. That territory to remain within the British sphere, and its limits to the westward, which will constitute the boundary between the British and Portuguese spheres of influence, are to be decided by a joint Anglo-Portuguese Commission.

In the early part of 1891 Her Majesty's Government extended the field of operations of the British South Africa Company's Charter so as to include the whole of the British sphere north of the Zambezi, except Nyasaland, under which name are included certain districts in the Lake Nyasa region, where British missionaries had been settled for over 15 years, and the African Lakes Company had been at work for the same period, and which in 1889 were declared to be within the British sphere of influence. On 14th May, 1891, the Nyasaland districts were proclaimed as being under the protectorate of Great Britain, their boundaries being thus defined:

On the east and south by the Portuguese dominions, and to the west by a frontier starting on the south from the point where the boundary of the Portuguese dominions is intersected by the boundary of the Conventional Free Trade Zone, defined in the first article of the Berlin Conference Act, following that line northwards to the point where it meets the line of the geographical Congo basin, defined in the same article, and thence along the latter line to the point where it touches the boundary between the British and German spheres defined in the 2nd paragraph of the 1st article of the agreement of the 1st July, 1890.

British Central Africa is divided into the British Central Africa Protectorate, representing the country formerly known as Nyasaland, and "North-Eastern Rhodesia." The first named is administered by a Commissioner and Consul-General under the direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and the second, by the British South Africa Chartered Company,* but the Commissioner holds certain powers of supervision. The expenses of administering the Protectorate are borne partly out of local revenues, the balance being borne by the Imperial Government.

On the Upper Shiré river and on Lake Nyasa the Protectorate Administration maintains three gun-boats, viz.: the "Dove," side-wheeler, on the Upper Shiré, and the "Pioneer" and "Guen-dolen" on Lake Nyasa. The last-named vessel is a large twin-screw steamer of 350 tons displacement, carrying 3 pr. Q.F. guns, and lit with electricity.

At Fort Johnston (south end of Lake Nyasa) there is an Administration station. At Chinde the only navigable mouth of the Zambezi, there is a small plot of land, known as the "British Concession," specially granted on lease by the Portuguese Government, where all goods in transit for British Central Africa are allowed to be landed, stored and transhipped free of customs duty.

The armed force necessary to maintain order within the Protectorate and the sphere of influence beyond (no slave trade now exists in Protectorate) consists of a corps of 140 Sikhs, seconded from the Indian Army, and allowed to serve in British Central Africa for three years (being relieved by fresh arrivals at the end of that period of service), and also of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the King's African Rifles, locally recruited. This force is officered by English officers. There is also a small armament of machine and mountain guns supplied by the Imperial Government.

In 1901, the military forces of the African Protectorates were amalgamated under the Foreign Office, and formed into one corps, styled the King's African Rifles. The existing units were formed into the following battalions: 1st C.A., 2nd C.A., 3rd East A., 4th Uganda, 5th Uganda (Indian), 6th Somali. The second battalion forms a reserve force available for service in any Protectorate.

Communications are maintained between British Central Africa and the sea (the chief "port" of the Protectorate being Chiromo at the junction of the Rivers Ruo and Shiré) by the river steamers of the African Lakes Company, B.C.A. Company, and the African International Flotilla Company. These vessels meet at Chinde the ocean-going steamers of the Rennie Aberdeen line (London to Natal and Chinde), the German East Africa Steampship Company of Hamburg, and the British India S.N.Co. (whose steamers connect Chinde with Mozambique, Zanzibar, and Bombay).

The chief town of British Central Africa is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there is a population of about 100 Europeans and 6,000 natives. Other towns and settlements are:—Zomba (the headquarters of the Administration, which is electrically lighted), Chiromo (the chief Customs station), Katunga, Chikwawa, Mpimbi, Fort Anderson, all more or less in the Shiré Highlands or on the River Shiré. Fort Johnston, Kotakota, Fort Maguire, Nkata, Chintechi, Likoma, Deep Bay, Fort Hill, and Karonga, are on or near Lake Nyasa. In N.E. Rhodesia, Fife, Abercorn, and Kitutsa are in the Tanganyika District; and Kalongwisi on Lake Meru. The Mission settlements in the Shiré Highlands and on Lake Nyasa have schools attached to them. The chief colonies of Europeans are to

be met with at these settlements; the total number of Europeans at present settled in the Protectorate is 463.

In the southern part of British Central Africa a number of Indian traders have already begun to establish themselves. The native population of the whole of British Central Africa is about 1,090,000, but large portions are devoid of a single human inhabitant owing to the fearful devastation caused in the past by slave raids.

The Shiré Province, which is that portion of the Protectorate lying between the south-west, south, and south-east shores of Lake Nyasa and the Zambezi, is now governed very much on the lines of a Crown colony. Good roads are being made in all directions, life and property are safe, and the bulk of the European population is congregated here. This province is remarkable for the development of coffee planting, which has taken place within the last few years, the coffee grown in the Shiré Highlands being of remarkable excellence. Formerly the chief trade on Lake Nyasa was in ivory, and elephants some years ago were fairly abundant all over B.C.A. At the present date, however, the amount of ivory collected in the Protectorate is very small, elephants having been very much thinned by the constant hunting carried on by natives. These animals are now strictly preserved, and already there are indications that their number is increasing. Cotton cultivation is now being undertaken on a large scale, and there is no doubt that this commodity will be the chief feature of export in the future. The cotton grown in Nyassaland has proved to be of very exceptional value.

Other articles of export from the Protectorate are tobacco, oil seeds, rhinoceros horns, hippopotamus teeth, strophanthus seeds, rubber, beeswax, chillies, rice, &c. The latter article is grown on the shores of Lake Nyasa in great perfection; the cultivation of wheat has been started, and has proved successful; rust, however, is a serious drawback. Oats and barley thrive on the uplands. Cattle and horses do well in most parts of the Protectorate, and there is an excellent market for stock in Southern Rhodesia, to which territory cattle and goats can be travelled overland without danger or loss.

The climate is on the whole healthier than that of many parts of tropical Africa, but cannot be called salubrious for Europeans generally, chiefly owing to the prevalence of malarial fevers.

The health records show that as the country becomes opened up it proves much healthier for Europeans than in its virgin state. Curiously enough, most of the complaints arise from cold and not from heat, which is nowhere very excessive, except during the height of the summer on the Shiré River. On the elevated plateaus and mountain ranges, which represent so large a proportion of the territory, the climate is chilly, especially during the winter months, and fires are necessary in the Europeans' houses during several months of the year.

The attention of capitalists is being directed to the great possibilities of trade on the Zambezi and the waterways connecting it with the lakes.

Surveys for a railway to connect Chiromo with Blantyre and Lake Nyasa have been completed. A concession for its construction was granted on Dec. 31, 1902, to the Shiré Nyasaland Company, Ltd., and the work has been commenced. An extension southwards along the Shiré to Port Herald has been completed. Telegraphic communication has been established from the Cape, via Matabeleland, Mashonaland, and Tete (on the Zambezi), with Blantyre, Zomba, and several other stations in the Protectorate. The telegraph wire, which is the property of the African Transcontinental Telegraph Company, passes through the Protectorate from south to north, crosses the Tanganyika plateau, and has reached Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika.
