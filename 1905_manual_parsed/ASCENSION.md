ASCENSION.

The island of Ascension, 34 miles in area, lying in the South Atlantic, lat. 7° 53' S. and long. 14° 18' W., is under the supervision of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who maintain a small naval station there. It was taken possession of in 1815, and is now garrisoned by marines. It is famous for its turtles, large numbers of which are caught between Dec. and May. The mail steamers from the Cape call there once a month, and it is connected by telegraph with St. Vincent, St. Helena, and Sierra Leone. It is a barren, rocky peak of purely volcanic origin, and destitute of vegetation, except at the highest point, 2,870 feet high, but has been cultivated to an extent permitting the maintenance of 3,000 sheep. The population is about 400. All expenses are charged to naval funds.

Captain, R. K. McAlpine, R.N.
