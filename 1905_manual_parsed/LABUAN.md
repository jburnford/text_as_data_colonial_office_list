LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30,23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about thirty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

The island, then uninhabited, was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846, and occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the Island. Hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success, but, in 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who have since transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. A certain quantity of coal is turned out every month, and the mines are now progressing more favourably.

The company has completed several buildings both in Victoria and at Coal Point.

The coal from the Brooketon mine of the Rajah of Sarawak is exported from Labuan, and, in 1901, 14,271 tons were brought over for sale.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty, and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the old jetties to coal.

A stone pier, with a wooden T-head to allow of coal wagons being directly discharged into vessels drawing 27 feet, has been constructed by the coal company.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton from standcocks close to the piers, and H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 15s. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and béche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation.

There are sago factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore. There is no bank or savings bank. The currency is Mexican dollars and copper cents, and North Borneo notes, but since the Japanese dollars were demonetised, British dollars have taken the leading place.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

Two schools are aided by Government grants, but there are no Government schools, and education is not compulsory.

The Government is administered by a Governor, who, under Letters Patent of 6th November, 1889, alone makes ordinances, there being no legislative council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant-in-aid, but since then the Colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony, which in turn has been replaced by armed constabulary from British North Borneo. At the end of 1889 it was arranged that the Governor of the territory of the British North Borneo Company should be appointed Governor of Labuan.

A railway has been made, 2 feet 5 inch gauge, and of about 10 miles in length, from Victoria Harbour to the coal mines at Coal Point. The railway is the property of the Labuan and Borneo Company, Ltd.

The Labuan Water Company was started in 1885, and, with two miles of piping, supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with potable water.

The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has connected Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong by cable via Labuan. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

Steamers go about twice a week to Singapore, and also to North Borneo and Sulu. The Sarawak Government steamer runs about once a fortnight between Kuching and Labuan. Most of the vessels calling at Labuan are engaged in the North Borneo trade, and ply regularly between the ports of that State, Singapore, and Manila, making Labuan a port of call, while several vessels call for bunker and cargo coal, on their way to and from northern ports of China, and the Philippines.

An excellent rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are cheaply supplied by a Navy contractor. The Colony has joined the Postal Union and the Imperial Penny Post.*
