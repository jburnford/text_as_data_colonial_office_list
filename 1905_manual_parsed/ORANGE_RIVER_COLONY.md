ORANGE RIVER COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Population.
The Orange River Colony lies to the north of the Orange River and Cape Colony, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts. The population in 1890 was 207,503, of whom 77,716 were white.

History and Constitution.
The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Mosheesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the inrush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897 and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted* in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a

*For an account of the events leading up to the war, and the war itself, see "Transvaal."
Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

By Letters Patent published on the 24th June, 1902, it was declared that there should be a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and also a Lieutenant-Governor in the Colony, and that there should be an Executive Council, to consist of such persons as should be directed by Royal Instructions, and a Legislative Council, to consist of the Lieutenant-Governor together with such persons, not being less than two at any time, as may be directed by Royal Instructions. The Legislative Council is empowered to establish such ordinances, and to constitute such courts and officers, and to make such provisions and regulations for the proceedings in such courts, and for the administration of justice, as may be necessary for the peace, order, and good government of the Colony; but power of disallowance of ordinances and also power of legislation is reserved to the Crown. The South African Constabulary is declared to be under the direct control of the High Commissioner.

The estimates for 1899 approved by the Road fixed the revenue at 604,914l., of which 323,314l. was from Railways and 121,000l. from Customs. This, with a balance carried forward from the previous year and temporary loans, made a total of 948,523l. The expenditure was estimated at 948,523l., including 290,758l. for new railway work and 108,124l. for paying off debt. The total debt in 1898 was 1,830,000l. The total trade in the same year was 1,923,428l. exports, and 1,190,923l. imports.

The finances of the colony are now in a satisfactory position. The revenue for 1903-4 considerably exceeded the original estimate (£563,300). The expenditure includes a contribution of £120,000 to the Inter-Colonial Council. (See under "South Africa" and "Transvaal.") The surplus is being utilised for the purpose of making advances to the smaller municipalities. It is remarkable, considering the adverse season, the withdrawal of capital for re-building and re-stocking, and other unfavourable circumstances, that the financial position, which depends mainly on the value of imports, is so good.

Railways.

The railway system which connects the lines from the Cape ports with the line to Johannesburg is, including three small branch lines, 442 miles long, and was built at a cost of 3,066,647l. To this must be added a line from the Natal border to Bethlehem, constructed at a cost of 265,270l., and worked by the Natal Government, a section from Thabanchu to Modderpoort, and a branch from Springfontein to Jagersfontein; a line from Ladysmith to Modderpoort is under construction. The following lines are contemplated:—(1) The "Grain line," connecting Bethlehem with Modderpoort; (2) Bethlehem to Kroonstad; (3) Aliwal North to Wepener. Negotiations have been proceeding with the Natal Government with regard to the first two of these lines, and with the Cape Government as to the third. The railways are worked under the name of the Central South African Railways, and administered by the Inter-Colonial Council of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony.*

Climate.

The Orange River Colony can be separated, roughly, into three divisions, viz.: the western, the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile, but requires irrigation.

The middle division, through which the railway runs, holds moisture longer than the western division, and will grow certain crops without irrigation. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock.

The eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe.

The heat, especially in the middle and western divisions, is great during the months of December, January, and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea, often rising on individual days to 105° and 108° Fahr. at 12 noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 76°7' and the mean minimum 45°8'.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer, when the south-east trades are prevalent. The mean annual rainfall for Bloemfontein for 16 years was 24 inches. In the eastern division it would be considerably more.

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

Currency and Banking.

British sterling and the gold of the late South African Republic are legal tender, and accounts are kept in British sterling.

Under the law of the late Orange Free State the National Bank of the Orange River Colony (in which the Government is represented by 70,000£ out of the total share capital of 100,000£), and the Bank of Africa were the only ones that were legally entitled to transact business in the Colony, but banking has since been made free for all banks obtaining the permission of the Government to open branches. The banks at present represented are the National Bank, the Standard Bank, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation and the National Bank of South Africa.

Notes of all the above banks are in circulation in the Colony.

Industries.

The leading, if not exclusive, industry of the country is agriculture, inclusive of stock and sheep-farming. An Agricultural Department is in process of formation, with branches for fruit-growing and forestry. There are four coal mines open, but, pending railway construction, only the Cornelia mine is at work, producing about 10,000 tons monthly. Extensive plant is being put down by new companies, and a large increase in the output may be looked for. Three diamond mines are actively at work, and yield a value of about £70,000 a month. Prospecting for both diamonds and gold is being energetically carried on; hitherto not with very encouraging results in the case of diamonds, but the rand formation has been struck by a drill at 1,200 feet near Villiers. Good building stone is obtainable near Bloemfontein and at other places in the Colony, especially at Ladybrand.

Land Settlement.

Although the season 1903-4 was a bad one, many of the crops failing, the settlers in occupation of Government land have on the whole done fairly well, and have settled down on friendly terms with their Dutch neighbours. The value of land purchased up to 30th April, 1904, was £787,400, of which a value of £772,432, representing 607,958 acres, was allotted. £33,590 was expended in advances to settlers. The number of settlers up to 31st December, 1903, was 614 (adult males).

Public Works.

The planning and construction of public buildings has proceeded steadily. The funds available from revenue have been supplemented by a loan of £500,000 from Inter-Colonial Loan Funds. Ten public offices, thirteen post offices, ten permanent and fifty temporary schools, and various other buildings have been constructed. The extension of the main Government offices at Bloemfontein has been commenced.

Education.

The schools are managed, teachers appointed, and all expenditure borne by Government. Local School Committees are being appointed with certain defined powers.

Since the declaration of peace, schools have been re-established in every town and village in the Colony. At the end of June, 1904, there was an attendance of 12,507 children, being more than twice the number under the former Government, and at present the course of instruction roughly follows the lines laid down by the Education Department of Cape Colony. Most of the trained teachers who volunteered for work in the Concentration Camps have been offered permanent work in the Colony and a considerable number in addition are being brought out from England and Scotland to make up the deficient supply of certificated teachers.

In Bloemfontein a Normal School has been organized for the training of Colonial teachers, while the Grey College and Girls' High School provide for higher education.

The main attention of the Government is now being devoted to providing educational facilities for the country districts. At the end of June, 1904, twelve ward and fourteen farm schools were in operation, with an attendance of 690 children.

The religious instruction, when desired by the parents, is conducted in the Dutch language, and in every school provision is made for the teaching of that language to those children whose parents wish it. English is the medium of instruction in all other subjects. No compulsion has been adopted.
