RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland.

2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo Free State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the British Central Africa Protectorate. It is divided into two provinces—North-Eastern Rhodesia and North-Western Rhodesia.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1898, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tati and Ramaquaban rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamatenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory is divided into two provinces:—

(a.) Barotziland North-Western Rhodesia.

(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.

(a.) The limits of Barotziland.—North-Western Rhodesia, as defined by the Barotziland—North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 28th of November, 1899, are the parts of Africa bounded by the River Zambesi, the German South-West Africa Protectorate, the Portuguese possessions, the Congo Free State, and the Kafukwe or Loengi River. Such limits further include so much of any territory belonging to the Bashukolumbwe Tribe as may lie east of the Kafukwe or Loengi River.

(b.) The limits of North-Eastern Rhodesia, as defined by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 29th January, 1900, are the parts of Africa bounded on the west, by the boundaries of the Congo Free State and of Barotziland, North-Western Rhodesia, as defined in "The Barotziland, North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899"; on the south by the Kafukwe River and the River Zambesi down to its junction with the Luangwa River, thence by the mid-channel of the Luangwa River northwards to where it is cut by the 16th degree of latitude, and from this point, by the Anglo-Portuguese boundary eastwards to the frontier of the British Central Africa Protectorate; on the east, by the aforesaid frontier; on the north, by the Anglo-German frontier, the south shore of Lake Tanganyika, and the southern frontier of the Congo Free State as far west as Lake Mweru, including the Island of Kiwa in the British sphere.

Area.

The area of Rhodesia is estimated to be about 750,000 square miles, of which Southern Rhodesia is computed to contain about 143,830 square miles.

Up to the 31st March, 1904, the total acreage of farms surveyed in Mashonaland was 10,271,719 English acres, and in Matabeleland 11,528,240 English acres.

In 1897 a geodetic survey of Southern Rhodesia was initiated under the superintendence of Sir David Gill, K.C.B., H.M. Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope. The field operations were concluded during August 9, 1901, the survey being completed to the Zambesi River. The geodetic survey from the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika was commenced in July, 1903, and is expected to be completed in three years' time.

History.

On the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lo Bengula,

* The information in this notice is kindly supplied by the British South Africa Company.
a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Macloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was reached on 12th September, 1890. The pioneers were then disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims and farms.

In July, 1893, the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lo Bengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson with a small party of men were, after a heroic resistance, killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lo Bengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from small-pox or fever.

At the end of 1895, occurred Dr. Jameson's raid into the Transvaal (see also under Bechuanaland Protectorate), which resulted in measures being taken to give the High Commissioner increased control over the Company's administration, especially the police. These were subsequently embodied in the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. Imperial troops had to be sent to the assistance of the Company's police and volunteers, and it was only after a prolonged struggle that peace was secured.

The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures.

In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established, and the precautions taken have proved very effective. No case has since been recorded, and the disease has been finally stamped out.

From 1897 to 1899 the development of the country advanced rapidly, but the outbreak of the war with the Republics, in October, practically put a stop to progressive work of every kind, and for months the territory was completely cut off from the south.

**Constitution.**

In 1888 that portion of Rhodesia, now known as Southern Rhodesia, was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original Charter of the Company by the Supplemental Charter, and a further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 10th of January, 1900.

The Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, originally laid down by the Charter, was subsequently amended by the Orders in Council of the 9th May, 1891; 30th July, 1891; and 18th July, 1894, the latter being known as the "Matabeleland Order in Council." This Order was revoked by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1898, which provides for the Administration of the Territory, Legislation, the Preservation of Peace and Order, the Constitution of Courts of Justice, and Native Administration. This Order was amended by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of the 16th February, 1903. Under the Order of 1898 there is a Resident Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State. To assist the Administrator there is an Executive Council, composed of not less than four members appointed by the Company, with the approval of the Secretary of State. A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), seven nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and seven members elected by the Registered Voters. The Resident Commissioner sits on both Executive and Legislative Councils, but without a vote. Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council, when assented to by the High Commissioner, take effect immediately, but, within a year, may be disallowed by the Secretary of State. The duration of each Legislative Council is 3 years. The first Legislative Council was elected in 1899. The number of Registered Voters in 1903 was 4,453.

By a Proclamation, dated 10th June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony, passed prior to that date, were adopted for and are to be administered in Rhodesia as far as the circumstances of the country will permit. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequent to that date do not apply to Rhodesia.

For the Administration of Justice there is a High Court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, the judges being appointed by the Secretary of State, on the nomination of the Company. In the districts there are Magistrates' Courts. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, and thence to the Privy Council.

The administrative systems of North-Eastern and North-Western Rhodesia are prescribed by the "North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council,"
1900," and the "Barotziland North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899," under which the administrations of those territories are placed under the control of H.M. Commissioner and Consul-General for British Central Africa and the High Commissioner for South Africa respectively.

Local Government.

Salisbury and Bulawayo were constituted municipalities in October, 1897. Sanitary Boards are appointed for the other principal townships.

Native Administration.

The Native Department of Southern Rhodesia is administered by the Secretary for Native Affairs, the duties of the office at the present time being undertaken by the Administrator. The two provinces are each under the control of a Chief Native Commissioner (who is responsible to the Secretary for Native Affairs), and are divided into native districts, 18 in Mashonaland and 10 in Matabeleland. Each district is in charge of a Native Commissioner or Assistant Native Commissioner, who is appointed by the Administrator, with the approval of the High Commissioner, as laid down in the "Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," and whose duties are defined by the "Native Regulations, 1898."

Formerly the natives were scattered throughout the country, but now land has been reserved for tribal settlements which is suitable for their agricultural and pastoral requirements.

The only tax imposed upon them is an annual hut-tax of £1. Excellent provision has been made for those who go to work at the mines. Compounds have been erected and hospitals provided at most of the mines, which are periodically visited by Government Inspectors; their contracts are supervised by officials who see that the terms are faithfully fulfilled, and in the event of injustice they have their remedy in a court of law under the "Master's and Servant's Ordinance." A native at the mines can easily earn from 30s. to £3 a month with food and lodging.

Boer War.

On the outbreak of hostilities Colonel (now Major-General) Baden-Powell was in supreme command of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. When Mafeking was invested the command of the Rhodesian forces devolved upon Colonel Plumer, who was stationed at Tuli with a force of 450 men. In November, 1899, Martial Law was proclaimed in certain districts in Matabeleland, and, at a later date, in the whole territory, and the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, to the number of 800, were called out for active service.

At the beginning of January, 1900, Colonel Plumer moved his column to Palachwe and assumed direct command of the troops in the Protectorate, amongst whom were included 600 Volunteers and over 400 men of the British South Africa Police. Mafeking was successfully relieved by Mahon and Plumer's united columns on the 17th May.

In the early part of 1900 a force of 5,000 men, consisting of Australian, New Zealand and Canadian Volunteers, and English Yeomanry, was despatched to Rhodesia, via Beira, under the command of General Sir Frederick Carrington. This force was sent to the front as speedily as possible, two companies of Militia Infantry being retained at Bulawayo as a garrison.

The Administration of Southern Rhodesia estimated that the number of men contributed by Rhodesia was approximately 1,500, being at least 12½ per cent. of the European population. Despatches which have been published bear testimony to the good work performed by the Volunteers, Police, and the Rhodesia Regiment, and they have also gained the special approbation of the late Commander-in-Chief.

The attitude of the natives throughout the war was most satisfactory, and, although in some districts there appeared signs of unrest, it was confined to attempts by discontented natives to work up the feelings of the people who were, however, not affected by them to any appreciable degree.

Martial Law in Southern Rhodesia was withdrawn on the 26th July, 1902.

Defence.

The defence of Southern Rhodesia devolves upon the British South Africa Police and Volunteer Force. The whole of the Military Police Force is under the direct control of the High Commissioner, although paid for by the Company. The cost of the force during the past four years has amounted to over 1,250,000L.

On the 5th October, 1903, the 2nd and 3rd Divisions of the Police were amalgamated, and on the 31st March, 1904, the strength of the Police Force was: officers, 42; N.C.O.'s and men, 531; Native Police, 427. At the same date the strength of the Volunteer Force was: Eastern Division (Mashonaland), officers and men, 824; Western Division (Matabeleland), 1,003, excluding cadets, of whom there are about 130.

Under an arrangement with the Imperial Government the military forces of British Central Africa are available for the territorial defence of North-Eastern Rhodesia.

Climate.

The Rhodesian plateau lies at an altitude of from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. Broadly speaking, the year has two divisions, the wet and the dry season. The early rains of the wet season (which is the summer) gradually appear towards the end of October, and increase in frequency and force until about the end of April. From May to September there is practically no rain. Taking into consideration the vast extent of the territory the climate naturally varies. In the highlands it is very healthy and bracing. Formerly, in the low-lying districts, malarial fever was very prevalent, but with the opening up of the country, better housing and food, it is rapidly disappearing. From medical statistics for the year 1903-4, it appears that out of 1,342 European cases treated in the hospitals only 3·27 per cent. proved fatal. The summer is not oppressively hot, nor is the winter very cold. The average shown by the maximum and minimum thermometers in the shade at the principal towns, during 1903-1904, was: Salisbury, max. 76°6, min. 53°1; Umtali, max. 77°3, min. 53°7; Bulawayo, max. 78°7, min. 54°3; Melsetter, max. 68°9; Victoria, max. 79°1, min. 52°5; Gwelo, max. 78°4, min. 52°1; Hopefountain, max. 79°2, min. 57°5; Empandeni, max. 80°8, min. 52°9; Belingwe, max. 83°0, min. 58°9.

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Victoria, and Gwelo, each supplied with a complete staff of doctors and nurses. Cottage hospitals have also been erected in the districts of Hartley, Enkeldoorn, Selukwe, Gwanda, and Filabusi to meet the wants of the mining centres.

Population.

A census for Southern Rhodesia was taken on the 17th April, 1904, showing the number of Europeans to be 12,623 (Mashonaland, 4,917; Matabeleland, 7,706). On the 31st March, 1904, the native population was estimated by Native Commissioners to be 564,000 (Mashonaland, 377,000; Matabeleland, 187,000). There were also 1,352 Colonial Natives and Asiatics.

Chief Towns.

The chief towns of Southern Rhodesia are Salisbury (the capital), Umtali, Victoria, Enkeldoorn, and Melsetter in Mashonaland; and Bulawayo, Gwelo, and Tuli in Matabeleland. New townships have been formed at Rusapi, Gwanda, Selukwe, and Hartley.

Salisbury, the seat of the Government, has a white population of 2,681. The town stands 4,700 feet above sea level. Branches of the Standard Bank, Bank of Africa, and African Banking Corporation have been established. It was constituted a municipality in 1897, and at the close of 1904 the assessed value of rateable property stood at 1,993,295L.

Bulawayo is the commercial centre of Southern Rhodesia, with a white population of 5,995, and stands 4,469 feet above the sea level. It was constituted a municipality in 1897, and the assessed valuation of rateable property in 1904 stood at 1,778,133L. Branches of the same banks as at Salisbury have been opened. There is a municipal hospital, which is one of the finest in South Africa. The town is on the main line of railway from Cape Town to the far north, and is distant from Cape Town 1,362 miles.

Railways.

The Bechuanaland Railways (now Rhodesia Railways, Limited) reached Bulawayo on the 19th October, 1897, and was formally opened on the 4th November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was opened on the 22nd May. This placed Salisbury in direct communication with the sea over a line 380 miles in length. On the 1st August, 1900, the widening of the gauge of the Beira Railway to 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa, was completed. On the 6th October, 1902, the line was completed between Salisbury and Bulawayo, and it is now possible to travel by rail from Cape Town to Beira, a distance of over 2,000 miles, without a change of carriage. Its length is about 290 miles, and it passes through the mining districts of Hartley, Sebakwe, Gwelo, Bembesi, etc., and within a few miles of the important district of Selukwe. A line (about 277 miles) from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, was completed on the 25th April, 1904. This is the first extension of the railway northwards from Bulawayo to Lake Tanganyika, and the construction of the line north of the river is being proceeded with. A line from Bulawayo to Gwanda to open up the gold and coal areas to the south-east has been constructed, and a line, with a 2 feet gauge, from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine in the Lomagundi district, was opened for traffic on the 15th October, 1902. A line from Gwelo to Selukwe (about 23 miles) was completed in August last, and one from Salisbury to Mazoe (about 30 miles) is being surveyed. A line to the Matopos, where Mr. Rhodes is buried, was ready for traffic on November 1st, 1903.

Lands and Agriculture.

Any person who is desirous of obtaining a grant of land in Southern Rhodesia should make written application to the Surveyor-General, Salisbury, who will, if satisfied that the applicant is in a position to beneficially occupy the land, and to carry on bond fide farming operations, recommend the application to His Honour the Administrator, for the issue of a permit. Grantees are required to occupy the land under such permit for a period of five years, in a bond fide and beneficial manner, either with cultivation or with stock. The rent to be paid during the term of occupation is fixed at 5 per cent. of the purchase price. The annual quit-rent or permanent rent, payable after the five years' term, is fixed at the rate of 1s. per 25 morgen or part thereof. The purchase money may be stated to average 9d. an acre in Mashonaland and 1s. 6d. an acre in Matabeleland. These charges are subject to slight increase where the land applied for is considered to be specially well situated or of exceptional value. The average size of farms in Mashonaland is 1,500 morgen (approximately 3,000 acres). Matabeleland farms are, as a rule, twice this size.

Survey fees, averaging 30L. for 1,500 morgen farms, and 40L. in the case of 3,000 morgen farms, are payable upon issue of the permit. In the case of settlers introducing stock and agricultural implements, payment of survey fees will be allowed to extend over a period of twelve months. Settlers bringing their own cattle with them to the port of Beira will, at present, be granted a special rate by the railway company of 2L. per head over the railway, and 5s. per head for sheep, in truckloads.

Since the pacification of the country considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. It may be said that virtually the whole of Southern Rhodesia is well watered, and adapted for stock-raising and for agriculture. Cattle generally do very well in all parts. Sheep and goats thrive in many parts and will do better after the grass is fed down. Horses are more uncertain, and are liable to horse sickness unless properly stabled. Pigs thrive well, and, so far, have never shown disease. Poultry and eggs always command a ready sale at remunerative prices. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical regions can be
successfully cultivated. Mealies, Kaffir-corn, and other native cereals grow well in the rainy season without irrigation. Tobacco occurs in a wild state, is grown universally by the natives, and has been produced of excellent quality by European farmers in several districts. Indiarubber and cotton are similarly indigenous and will well repay cultivation. Large fruit orchards are in course of formation, and all fruit trees thrive. Grapes, figs, oranges, peaches, almonds, walnuts, lemons, bananas, quinces, apricots, apples, and pomegranates of good quality are produced. The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns.

**Roads.**

On March 31st, 1904, the total mileage of roads in Southern Rhodesia was about 3,750 miles, including about 650 miles of cross roads in mining and farming districts. In these figures roads which have fallen into disuse owing to railway construction are not included. The total expenditure on all roads and river crossings during the year 1903-4 was 15,080l.

**Posts and Telegraphs.**

The mails from the United Kingdom to Southern Rhodesia are conveyed by the mail steamers of the subsidised Union-Castle Company, weekly, between Southampton and Table Bay. From Cape Town they are conveyed by train to Bulawayo in three days. There are also daily mail and passenger trains from Cape Town to Bulawayo performing the journey in four days. From Bulawayo to Salisbury the mails are conveyed three times a week, the journey occupying about 24 hours. There are two mail and passenger trains weekly between Salisbury and Beira, the time occupied on the journey being thirty hours.

The outlying districts of Southern Rhodesia are served by mail coaches and carts, but the mails to the less important districts are conveyed by native runners.

North-Western Rhodesia (Barotsealand) receives its mails via Bulawayo. They are conveyed from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls by train, and to the several postal stations in the territory by native runners.

The North-Eastern Rhodesia postal service, which formerly was carried out via Chinde, is now performed via the Salisbury-Feira route, although mail matter may still be forwarded to Fort Jameson and other stations in the territory by the Chinde and Blantyre route. The time occupied in the transmission of the mails between Fort Jameson and the United Kingdom is now about six weeks.

On the 31st of March, 1904, fifty-eight post offices were open in Southern Rhodesia, at eighteen of which Money Order business was transacted. Telegraph Money Orders are also exchanged between Money Order Offices in Rhodesia and with Money Order Offices in the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony.

The rate for inland letters is one penny per ½ oz. for letters to other parts of South Africa 1d. per ½ oz., and for letters for places over-sea 2½d. per ½ oz.

The Rhodesian Telegraph system extends from Ramathlabama, on the northern border of Cape Colony, to Ujiji in German East Africa, and comprises 6,056 miles of wire, on 3,832 miles of poles. The section of line from Umtali to Ujiji is the property of the African Trans-continental Telegraph Company, but is under the control of the Postmaster-General of Southern Rhodesia.

On the 31st March, 1904, 67 telegraph offices were open. The rate for Inland telegrams is 1d. per word; for telegrams exchanged between Rhodesia and other parts of South Africa, 2½d. per word; and for cablegrams to Europe is 2½d. per word. Telegrams from Europe and from South Africa, for the Portuguese province of Manica and Sofala, Portuguese East Africa (including Chinde and Quelimane), the Nyasaland Protectorate, North Eastern Rhodesia, and for German East Africa, all pass over the Rhodesian lines.

Telephone exchanges are in operation at Bulawayo, Salisbury, Umtali, Gwelo, and Selukwe, the total number of subscribers being 283, and the length of wire used 308 miles.

**Customs.**

Prior to the 1st August, 1899, no duties were leviable upon goods entering Southern Rhodesia. On that date the Customs Ordinance came into operation, and continued in force till August, 1903, when, as a result of the South African Customs Conference, the necessary Ordinance empowering Southern Rhodesia to enter the newly-formed Customs Union was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council. During the eight months ending 31st March, 1900, the net amount of Customs duty received was 39,639l.; the value of dutiable goods imported was 83,901l., and non-dutiable goods 186,830l. During the year ending 31st March, 1901, the net amount of duty received was 91,430l.; the value of the dutiable goods being 322,522l., and non-dutiable goods 899,446l. During the year ended 31st March, 1902, the net amount of duty received was 124,634l.; the value of dutiable goods was 498,882l., and non-dutiable goods 944,165l. During the year ended 31st March, 1903, the net amount of duty received was 123,673l.; the value of the dutiable goods being 495,240l., and non-dutiable goods 1,363,329l. During the year ended 31st March, 1904, the amount of duty collected was 128,388l.; and the value of imports 1,576,620l. An Ordinance was promulgated on 1st October, 1901, imposing a duty of 6s. per gallon on spirits manufactured in South Africa, and imported into the Territory. Another Ordinance was also promulgated upon the same date imposing an excise duty of a similar amount upon spirits manufactured within Southern Rhodesia.

**Minerals.**

GOLD.—That gold was obtained from Rhodesia many centuries before the Christian Era is evidenced from the innumerable "ancient workings," the ruins of temples and forts supposed to date from the time of the Himyarites and Phoenicians, and the discovery of gold beads, gold plates, fine chains, wire, nails, etc. From the occupation of the country in 1890 by the British South Africa Company when the European population amounted to about 200 persons, consisting of the pioneers and a few officials, up to September, 1898, the gold produced only amounted to 6,470 ounces. Since that date, however, the output has been steadily increasing, notwithstanding the unparalleled difficulties which were encountered in the shape of war, rinderpest, etc. Owing to the rapid progress of railway construction, transport of machinery is now not so difficult.
Some of the mines began to crush in September, 1898, and the following table shews the progress made:

| Year     | Revenue (ozs) |
|----------|---------------|
| Up to December, 1896 | 6,018 ozs |
| 1897     | 215           |
| 1898     | 16,706        |
| 1899     | 56,742        |
| 1900     | 85,366        |
| 1901     | 172,035       |
| 1902     | 194,170       |
| 1903     | 231,872       |
| 1904     | 267,737       |

On the 31st March, 1904, 490 stamps were actually in use, and over 150 were in course of erection or were proposed to be erected.

**Coal.**—For some years past coal has been known to exist in several districts, but it is only recently that the value of the deposits has been definitely ascertained. In the Wankie District, 200 miles from Bulawayo, and 77 miles from the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, a coal bed of vast extent has been disclosed. The result of careful and systematic examination shows that as regards quality the best of the coal is only from 4 to 6 per cent inferior to Welsh steam coal of similar quality, and the worst portion is superior to any coal hitherto discovered in Africa. Other promising discoveries of coal have lately been made in the Victoria, Tuli, Lomagundi and Sebungwe districts, but, so far, sufficient exploratory work has not been carried out to admit of a final opinion being pronounced as to their precise value.

**Copper.**—Discoveries of copper have recently been reported in the Victoria, Lomagundi and Melsetter districts in Southern Rhodesia, and highly promising deposits have been disclosed both in North-Eastern and North-Western Rhodesia. In the year ending 31st March, 1904, the number of copper claims registered amounted to 4,751.

**Education.**

In 1899 an Education Ordinance, providing for grants-in-aid of both voluntary and undenominational schools, was passed, and satisfactory progress has been made in placing the educational system of the country on an improved basis. On the 31st March, 1904, there were in Southern Rhodesia fourteen state-aided schools. The total number of European pupils was 630, or an increase of 61 over the previous year. The total net expenditure amounted to £6,480, while loans amounted to £740. The St. Cyril's School at Bulawayo for coloured children is specially aided, and there are four native schools aided by the Government.
