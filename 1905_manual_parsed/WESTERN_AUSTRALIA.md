**WESTERN AUSTRALIA.**

**Situation and Area.**

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 50' E.

**Coast Line.**

The Southern and Western coast line is, to a great extent, of a flat and sandy character, with comparatively few natural harbours or other indentations, until the Kimberley Division is reached, where its character changes, and it becomes bold and broken, and fringed with numerous islands. The total length of the coast line, following known indents, is estimated to be approximately 5,200 miles.

**Bays, Gulfs, &c.**

The principal inlets, beginning from the north, are: Cambridge Gulf, Napier Broome Bay, Vansittart Bay, Admiralty Gulf, Montague Sound, York Sound, Brunswick Bay, Camden Sound, Collier Bay, King Sound, Beagle Bay, Roebuck Bay, Lagrange Bay, Port Walcott, Nickol Bay, Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, Champion Bay, Cockburn Sound, Koombana Bay, Geographe Bay, Flinders Bay, King George Sound, Bremer Bay, and Esperance Bay. With the exception of Princess Royal Harbour (the inner harbour of King George Sound), the principal anchorages used to the south of the 19th parallel of latitude are open roadsteads, which, as a rule, are only partially protected; but the holding grounds of these are fairly good, and accidents seldom happen to vessels properly found. Fine harbours have, however, been artificially provided at Fremantle, at the mouth of the Swan River, and at Bunbury, in Koombana Bay.

**Capes.**

The principal capes are: Capes Domet and Dussejour at the entrance of Cambridge Gulf; Cape Londonderry, which is the most northerly point of the State; Cape Talbot, Cape Bougainville, lying between Admiralty Gulf and Vansittart Bay; Cape Voltaire, which is the western boundary of Admiralty Gulf; Cape Torrens, at the entrance to York Sound; Cape Lévéque, the southern boundary of King Sound; Sloping Head, to the west of Nickol Bay, well-known to the North-West pearlers; North-West Cape, which forms the western boundary of Exmouth Gulf; Cape Peron, in Shark Bay; Steep Point, situated on
the southern entrance to Shark Bay, which is the most westerly point of the Continent; Capes Naturaliste and Leeuwin at the south-western extremity of the Continent, and Point D'Entrecasteaux, West Cape Howe, Peak Head, Hood Point, Cape le Grande, and Cape Arid on the Southern coast.

Tides.

As would naturally be expected with so extensive a coast line, the tides are very varied, little or no rise and fall being experienced on the South and South-Western coasts, whilst from Shark Bay northwards they increase rapidly, though not uniformly in range, attaining at King Sound a height of 46 feet.

Islands.

The islands which occur on the coast are, as a rule, small and unimportant, those best known being Garden and Rottnest Islands off Fremantle; the Houtman Abrolhos, near Champion Bay, on which guano is found; Dirk Hartog and other islands in Shark Bay, used for pastoral purposes; Dampier's Archipelago and the Lacepedes, on the North-West coast, the latter of which also contain guano deposits; and, in addition to these, there are the numerous but as yet unexplored islands off the Kimberley or extreme northern coast.

Rivers.

The principal rivers are: in the North, the Ord, with its tributaries, the Denham, Bow, Negri, and Panton; the Pentecost, with its tributary, the Chamberlain; the Durack, Drysdale, King Edward, Prince Regent, Charnley, Isdell, and the Fitzroy, with its tributaries the Margaret River and Christmas Creek. In the North-West the De Grey, with its tributaries, the Oakover, Shaw, and Strelley; the Yule, the Fortescue, and the Ashburton, with its tributaries, the Henry and Hardy. Then, falling to the Western Coast, the Gascoyne, with its tributary, the Lyons; the Murchison, with its tributary, the Sanford; the Greenough; the Swan, on which is situated the capital of the State, and which, above tidal waters, is called the Avon; the Murray, the Collie, and the Preston. And lastly, on the Southern Coast, the Blackwood, Warren, Kalgan, and Phillips Rivers.

Mountains.

In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the King Leopold and the Princess May ranges, the highest point in the latter probably attaining above 3,000 feet. In the North-West, between the Fortescue and Ashburton Rivers, the highest range is the Hamersley, with Mount Bruce (3,800 feet). The Darling range, which extends from Yatheroo in the North to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles, attains its highest elevation, 1,700 feet above the level of the sea, at Mount William in the Murray District. In the South, the loftiest range is the Stirling range, the highest point of which is a little over 3,000 feet.

Lakes.

There are no lakes of any considerable importance in the State. Between the Darling range and the coast there are a few salt water lagoons, and many fresh water lakes, the majority of which are nothing more than swamps during the dry season, and none of them are of any economic importance. The so-called lakes in the interior of the State, which are frequently of very considerable area, are, except after the occasional heavy rains, merely immense salt marshes or clay-pans.

Contour of the Country.

That part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as mountainous, consisting of alternating high and lower lying plateaux; the highest country here is principally of sandstone formation. The North-West Division and much of the Gascoyne Division is a distinctly mountainous country, the ranges here being principally granite. The north and north-eastern parts of the State contain a large area of good pastoral country. A large proportion of the South-Western and Southern sea-boards is of flat, sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation, and may be described as a vast forest, principally timbered with jarrah, white and red gums, and karri, most of which timbers are of great commercial value. From some points on the Western sea-board settlement has now extended for about 600 miles inland; but, from very complete information furnished by explorers and prospectors, it is apparent that no considerable portion of the interior lying between the 19th and 31st parallels of latitude, and between the 121st and 129th meridians of longitude is suitable for any class of settlement except in connection with the development of the mineral resources. This area may be described as a great table-land, with an altitude of from one to two thousand feet above sea level, the surface of which consists largely of sand dunes, though in many parts of it there are large areas of clayey soils. Between the 30th parallel of latitude and the Great Australian Bight, much of the country is of limestone formation, and here there are immense areas of grass land, which only await the discovery of subterranean water to make them amongst the most productive areas of the State.

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain James (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, in H.M.S. Success, surveyed the coast from King George Sound to the Swan River, and in 1829 Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. Challenger, took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain Stirling founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success, until, in 1850, the State was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned that it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until, on the 30th June, 1886, only forty Imperial prisoners remained. The Imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution, which was what is called "Representative," was established, by Act 33 Vict., No. 13. The Governor was assisted
by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council, consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The Legislature consists of two Houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 30 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 50 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The State is divided into 10 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the State for at least 2 years; (3) a natural-born subject of His Majesty or naturalised for 5 years, and a resident in the State during that period.

Qualification of Elector.—"The Constitution Act Amendment Act, 1899," has extended the right to vote equally to both sexes. Every person seeking to be registered as an elector must (1) be at least 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity; (2) be a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty, resident in the State for 6 months; (3) within the electoral province for which he seeks to be registered: (a) possess a freehold estate of the clear value of 100l. above all charges or encumbrances affecting the same; or (b) be a householder, the dwelling-house being of the clear annual value of 25l.; or (c) be holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 25l.; or (d) be holder of a lease or license from the Crown at an annual rental of at least 10l.; or (e) have his or her name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property in the province of the annual rateable value of 25l. When registered he or she shall be entitled to vote for each of any number of candidates not exceeding the number of members to be elected for the province.

Legislative Assembly.—There are 50 electorates for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by one member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 3 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the State for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the King, or shall have been naturalised for 5 years, and shall have resided in the State for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Any person of either sex of the age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall have resided in the State for at least 6 months, if he (1) is resident in the district at the time of making his claim; or (2) has a freehold estate in the district of the clear value of 50l.; or (3) is a householder, the house or premises being of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (4) is the holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 10l.; or (5) is the holder of a lease or license from the Crown to depasture, occupy, cultivate or mine Crown lands within the district, at an annual rental of 5l.; or (6) has his name on the electoral list of a municipality or roads board in respect of property within the district, is entitled to be registered as an elector for the Legislative Assembly. After having been registered he or she is entitled to vote for a member for the district. No person can be a registered voter in more than one electorate.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible Ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Premier and Colonial Treasurer, also Minister for Education; the Minister for Mines and Justice; the Minister for Lands; the Minister for Works; the Colonial Secretary; and the Minister for Railways and Labour.

Western Australia is represented in the Federal Senate of Australia by six members, and in the House of Representatives by five members.

Local Government.

Under the "Municipal Institutions Act, 1900," municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Boulder, Bulul, Broad Arrow, Busselton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Collie, Coolgardie, Coossack, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Guildford, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Kookynie, Leederville, Leonora, Malcolm, Mt. Morgans, Mt. Magnet, Menzies, Midland Junction, Nannine, Newcastle, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, North Perth, Paddington, Perth, Roebourne, South Perth, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Victoria Park, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a mayor and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and 12 councillors or three councillors for each ward—the mayor being elected annually by the ratepayers, by whom also the councillors are elected for a term of three years.

Local roads boards and municipal councils have power under Acts of Parliament to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under the Water Works Act, 1889 (53 Vict., 13), the Perth City Council was authorised to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £, but this power was, under the Metropolitan Water Works Act (60 Vict., No. 19), transferred to the Metropolitan Water Works Board; also under The Health Act, 1898, the local boards of health of municipalities and other localities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 6d. in the £; 60,000l. was granted in 1903 to district roads boards (of which there were, on the 30th June, 1904, 98) and municipal councils (44) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the State, in addition to the moneys expended by the Public Works Department for the same purpose.
Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the State at the 30th June, 1904, was estimated to be 238,003, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese at the 1901 census was 1,521, of whom 1,503 were males and only 18 females. In addition to these there were 23 male and 25 female half-caste Chinese.

The chief towns are Perth (46,400, including suburbs), Fremantle (24,050, including suburbs), and the following municipalities:—Coolgardie (3,830), Kalgoorlie (6,780), Albany (3,435), Bunbury (2,677), Claremont (2,727), Geraldton (2,504), Guildford (1,666), Kanowna (1,212), Menzies (1,046), Northam (2,426), York (1,339), Midland Junction (2,208).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the State, 10,548,057 acres only were, on the 31st December, 1903, alienated or in process of alienation, while 135,678,028 acres were leased, viz., 134,687,972 for pastoral, and the balance for other purposes. No less than 478,362,715 acres were still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 5,200 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the south-west corner of the State are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the State, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total area of land under crop on 29th Feb., 1904 was 283,752 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialised in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian States, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,600,633) are depastured in all parts of the State. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1903, principally to London, was 12,907,065 lbs., which, at 8d. per lb. for greasy and 1s. 4d. per lb. for scoured, is valued at 443,743l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1903 was valued at 620,012l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore, China, and other places to the value of about 37,913l. during 1903.

At Shark Bay and on the north-west coast a fleet of 267 schooners, cutters, and luggers are employed on the pearling banks, giving occupation to 154 white, 75 aboriginal, and 1,527 Asiatic pearlers. The export of pearls and shell amounted to 224,322l. in 1903.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but of late years little work has been done in them. Copper, however, is now found also in the Day Dawn District, on the Ashburton Goldfield, the West Pilbara Goldfield, the Phillips River Goldfield, and more especially in the Mt. Malcolm District, and the exports of copper (ingot and ore), during 1901, amounted to 110,769l.; the export during 1902 only amounted to 12,904l.; but in 1903 it increased again, amounting during that year to 37,815l.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners to Western Australia, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

Since the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining has become the principal industry of the State, and so rapidly has the annual output of gold increased of late, that it has now placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing States of Australasia.

There are now 19 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, Phillips River, and Donnybrook, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a great future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold produced up to the end of September, 1904, was 52,726,049l. In the first nine months of 1904, the value of the gold production was 6,285,016l., against 6,632,215l. in the corresponding period of 1903.

There is also good coal in the south-west corner of the State, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, four companies are now successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1903 was 133,427 tons.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood river. There is little doubt that a fairly rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood. Considerable quantities of tin have also been recently raised at Marble Bar. The total exports of tin (ingot and ore), during 1903, amounted to 52,133l.

Silver is found, mostly in conjunction with other minerals. Other minerals found are ironstone and limestone.
Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the State: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia, and the Bank of Australasia.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1903, averaged 4,792,090l.

A Government Post Office savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1896, amounted to 520,016l., during the year ended 30th June, 1897, to 1,068,322l., during the year ended 30th June, 1898, to 1,231,638l., during the year ended 30th June, 1899, to 1,057,022l., during the year ended 30th June, 1900, to 1,112,251l., during the year ended 30th June, 1901, to 1,333,376l., during the year ended 30th June, 1902, to 1,534,010l., during the year ended 30th June, 1903, to 1,605,148l., and during the year ended 30th June, 1904, to 1,631,687l.

A branch of the Royal Mint exists in Perth. The quantity of raw gold received at the Perth Mint during 1901 was 860,281 ozs., during 1902, 1,354,615 ozs., during 1903, 1,452,624 ozs., and during the nine months ended 30th September, 1904, 1,033,560 ozs.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the State, and are under the supervision of the Minister (Premier) controlling the Education Department, assisted by district boards.

Attendance at school of all children between the ages of six and fourteen is compulsory, and only in special circumstances is exemption granted to children between the ages of 12 and 14. General religious teaching, exclusive of dogmatic or polemic theology, is included in the course of instruction given, whilst half-an-hour each day is reserved for special religious denominational instruction if desired.

Cadet corps have been organised in connection with several State schools.

Western Australia does not at present possess an University, but aspirants for the B.Sc. degree of the Adelaide University may go through their full course at the Perth Technical School. Local examinations for B.A. and LL.B. degrees of the Adelaide and the London Universities may also be arranged for, as well as for the B.Sc. and B.Sc. (Economics) of the latter institution. The Adelaide University Junior, Senior, and Higher Public Examinations are held at regular intervals, whilst the London and Melbourne Universities hold them whenever occasion arises. Steps have been taken to reserve land for the purpose of endowment of a local University.

The Perth Technical School, which has now been established some years, is in a very flourishing condition, and the scope of its curriculum is correspondingly increasing. Besides the Boys' High School, which is subsidised by the State, there are the Christian Brothers' College, the Scotch College, and the Guildford Grammar School, which provide for boys the necessary basis for an university education, whilst for the girls similar institutions exist in the Girls' High School, the Notre Dame Convent, and the Loretto Convent. Several bursaries of the value of 10l. each are offered by the Government for competition annually amongst boys and girls attending Government and efficient private primary schools. Three or more secondary school scholarships, of the value of 50l. per annum, tenable for three years, in an approved secondary school, are also offered. In addition to these, five Senior Exhibitions of 25l. and eight Junior of 15l. each are competed for on the results of the Adelaide University Higher Public, Senior, and Junior Examinations, whilst an University Exhibition of 150l. a year, tenable for three years in any recognised University of the British Empire, is also offered by the Government for competition.

In order that the State may be assured that all children attending private schools are receiving efficient instruction, these schools are regularly inspected, to ascertain whether the instruction given in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography, is satisfactory.

The amount disbursed for education during the financial year ended June 30th, 1904, was 134,337l.

In the year 1903, there were 270 Government schools in the State, with 24,267 scholars on the rolls. The number of private schools in 1903 was 92, with 6,757 scholars.

Means of Communication.

The State possesses at present (Sept., 1904), four lines of Government railways: The Eastern and Eastern Goldfields Railway (705 miles), connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with Perth, Guildford, Northam, Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Menzies, Kookynie, Mount Malcolm, and Mount Leonora, including branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), from Northam to Goomalling (31 miles), from Spencer's Brook Junction to York and Beverley (38 miles), Yprk to Greenhills (15 miles), Midland Junction to Pickering Brook (15 miles), Fremantle to Owens Anchorage (3 miles), and two miles to the Perth racecourse; also a branch line (9 miles), running out from Kalgoorlie to the Boulder, with a loop line to Brown Hill (4½ miles) and Hannan's Lake; the Northern Railway (353 miles), connecting Geraldton with Northampton (34 miles), in the Champion Bay mining district, with Walkaway (18 miles), and with Cue and Nannine (310 miles); the South-Western Railway (240 miles), from Perth to Bunbury, from Picton Junction to Busselton, from Boyanup Junction to Bridgetown, and from Brunswick Junction to Collie Coalfields, and the Great Southern from Beverley to Albany (243 miles)—in all, 1,541 miles of railway open for traffic.

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and connects the two Government systems of railways.

There are also several other private lines, mostly constructed by timber companies in the south of the State, in extent about 343 miles.

A scheme is at present under consideration by the Commonwealth Government for the connection, by a proposed Transcontinental Railway (4ft. 8½in. gauge) from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, of the Railway systems of Western and South Australia, a distance of about 1,100 miles.

The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1904, were 1,588,084l., and the working expenses 1,179,624l. The total cost of construction has been 8,955,929l.
Of electric telegraph at the end of 1903 there were 9,369 miles of wire. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1903 was 1,587,734, and the revenue received by the telegraph branch was 68,137l.; telephone receipts amounted to 30,324l., and postal and other revenue of the post and telegraph department to 122,862l.; cost of post and telegraph, 277,021l. There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay, also with South Africa by Cocos Island. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the State, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 5,431 miles of telephone wire in the State; further 7,178 miles of Government, and 475 miles of private railway telephone wire.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient, Messageries Maritimes, and Nord-Deutscher Lloyd Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the other Australasian States. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australasia States by the various inter-State steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 28 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers per ½-oz. |
|--------------------------------|
| Within a Town, and between any two places on the Suburban Railway Line from Fremantle to Midland Junction | 1d. ½d. per 10 ozs. |
| Within the State | 2½d. ½d. per 10 ozs. |
| Australasia | 2½d. ½d. per 10 ozs. |
| United Kingdom and Postal Union | 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs. |

The postal statistics for 1903 give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

| English, Inter-State, Inland, and Foreign. |
|------------------------------------------|
| Letters (ordinary) | 9,832,929 |
| Registered letters | 117,808 |
| Newspapers | 3,854,469 |
| Packets and parcels | 2,993,996 |
| Postcards | 394,415 |

(a) These were included under other heads, principally letters.

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 324 vessels and a tonnage of 21,612 on 31st December, 1903. Harbour works there are practically completed, and the Royal Mail steamers, as also those of the Nord-Deutscher Lloyd and the Messageries Maritimes, now call at the port.

**Defence.**

In December, 1903, the Military forces of the State consisted of 1,260 (officers 101, other ranks, 1,159). Of this number 59 belonged to the Permanent Force, and the remainder to the Militia and the various Volunteer corps. King George Sound, on the south coast, is strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian Government and the War Office.

It may not be out of place to mention that Western Australia contributed six companies of mounted infantry for military service in South Africa during the late war; and, in addition, three squadrons of mounted men, one for each of the Commonwealth Contingents.

### Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are occasionally employed as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule, they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (founded by the late Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the Houses of Legislature in 1897. In accordance with its clauses, the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and...
provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of £5,000, to be used by this sub-department. In addition to this sum, a further amount of £7,965 was spent on behalf of the Aborigines during the year ending 30th June, 1904.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate during 1903 was 12·60 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 32·99 inches (for 28 years), and the mean temperature is 65°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

British New Guinea.

Situation and Area.

The Possession of British New Guinea is composed of a portion of the island of New Guinea, and of a number of islands, most of which lie to the south-east of New Guinea. The boundaries of the Possession are as follows:—"The S. and S.E. shores of New Guinea, from 141° E. long. eastward as far as East Cape, thence N.W. to 8° S. lat. in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock, together with the territory lying south of a line from Mitre Rock proceeding along the said 8° S. parallel to 147° E. long., then in a straight line N.W. to the intersection of 6° S. lat. and 144° E. long., and continuing W.N.W. to the intersection of 5° S. lat. and 141° E. long. together with the Trobriand, Woodlark, d'Entrecasteaux, and Louisiade groups of islands, and all other islands lying between 8° and 12° S. lat. and between 141° and 155° E. long., and not forming part of Queensland; and including all islands and reefs lying in the Gulf of Papua to the north of 8° S. lat."

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if Australia is excluded, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland, between 0° 0' and 12° 0' S. lat., and between 130° 50' and 154° 30' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 234,768 square miles. The islands which lie near New Guinea, and which form part of the Possession, number, great and small, about two hundred. Of these the principal ones are: Kiriwina (in the Trobriand group of D'Entrecasteaux), Woodlark, Normanby, Goodenough, Fergusson, St. Aignan, Rossel and Sudest.

History.

The island of New Guinea was discovered in 1511 by Antonio de Abrea, and it was touched at by several of the early navigators. The Archipelagos lying to the south-east of New Guinea were discovered by French navigators towards the close of the eighteenth century. The waters that are adjacent to the Archipelagos, and to the south-eastern coasts of New Guinea, have at different periods been partly surveyed and mapped by British ships of war.

The whole island to the west of 141° E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of Tidore. The Dutch have established a post on the south coast of New Guinea, which is in charge of a Resident. That portion of the island which lies to the eastward of 141° E. long. and to the north of British New Guinea belongs to the German Empire. A Government has been established and several industries are being started there. The acquisition by the British Crown of the portion of the island not claimed by Holland was long advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement in the French island of New Caledonia, created some alarm in Australia lest a country lying so near to Australia as New Guinea should pass into the hands of a foreign Power. To prevent this from taking place as regards the eastern part of New Guinea, the Government of Queensland annexed it to the Empire on the 4th of April, 1883, but this proceeding was not ratified by the Imperial Government. The Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in Nov. and Dec., 1883, passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertook to recommend their respective Legislatures to provide for defraying a part of the cost of a Protectorate if one were established by the Imperial Government. On the Australasian colonies agreeing to guarantee 15,000£ a year to meet the cost, a Protectorate was proclaimed by Commodore Erskine on the 6th November, 1884, over the south-east coast of New Guinea and the adjacent islands.

General Sir Peter Scratchley was appointed Special Commissioner for the Protectorate, and arrived in 1885, but he succumbed shortly after his arrival in the Protectorate to malarial fever. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G., formerly Premier of Queensland. At the Colonial Conference held in 1887, the Colonies of Queensland, N.S. Wales and Victoria undertook to guarantee 15,000£ a year for ten years, for defraying the cost of administering the territory now forming the Possession, on the understanding that Her
Majesty's Sovereignty would be proclaimed over it.

By the Queensland British New Guinea Act, 1887, that colony undertook to be responsible for the payment of the 15,000l. a year. The territory was annexed to the Crown by the newly-appointed Administrator, Dr. (now Sir W.) Macgregor, on 4th Sept., 1888.

The Imperial Government has contributed some 52,000l. towards the founding of the Possession. The local revenue raised in the Possession was formerly paid over to Queensland, for distribution amongst the guaranteeing colonies, in reduction of their contribution of 15,000l. a year, but is now kept and expended by the Government of the Possession.

At the end of 1900 the Government of the Commonwealth agreed to take over the Possession as a territory of the Commonwealth, and brought proposals before the Federal Parliament (which were adopted) for providing towards the expenses of administration a sum not exceeding 20,000l. a year. The provision runs from 1st July, 1901, and is subject to revision at the end of five years. The future arrangements for the Government are dealt with in the Papua Bill now before the Commonwealth Parliament (which provides for a change to the name of Territory of Papua).

Description and Formation.

It extends from east to west upwards of 300 miles, and about 200 from north to south towards either end, but is only about 50 miles deep behind Freshwater Bay, near the middle of the portion of the colony that is situated on the island of New Guinea. The total coast line of the Possession has been computed at 3,664 statute miles, 1,728 on the mainland and 1,936 on the islands. The total superficial area of the colony is about 90,540 square miles, of which about 87,786 are on the mainland of New Guinea, and 2,754 made up of many islands.

With the exception of the low coral islands of Kiriwina, Nada, part of Murua, and a few others of small dimensions, the islands are mountainous and principally of schistose formation, the highest, Goodenough, 8,000 feet. The eastern end of the colony is also mountainous, and as the mountains extend westward they rise and coalesce to form a great central chain, which attains its greatest altitudes in the Owen Stanley range, the highest point of which is Mount Victoria, 13,200 feet, and in Mount Scratchley, the Wharton Range, and Mount Albert Edward, the latter about the same height as Mount Victoria. Further west the main range becomes more broken and lower, while pursuing nearly the same general trend towards the north-west as it had in the more eastern part of the colony. The western end of the Possession is for nearly 300 miles generally low and swampy until a long distance from the coast is reached. The mountains near the east end, on the mainland, are of igneous origin; the great masses of the central part of the main range are all schistose, while in the west sandstone predominates, but there are outcrops of igneous formation, such as Mount Yule, upwards of 10,000 feet high. On the Fly River, near the point of junction of British, Dutch, and German territory, there are limestones with fossil corals, and these are also met with at many other places in the low and swampy regions of the western end of the colony and elsewhere. The whole Possession is remarkably well watered. The great mountains, and by far the larger portion of the lower country, are all covered by forest.

Rivers.

The majority of the principal rivers open into the Gulf of Papua. They have a general direction towards a point near the middle of the Gulf. The two largest are the Fly and the Purari. The Fly spreads out its head branches over a large area in the centre of the island, comprising considerable portions of the three different territories. Its course is about 620 miles from the sea to the British-German boundary. The influence of the tide is felt for six or seven score of miles up the Fly. It is navigable by a steam launch for over 500 miles.

The Purari River is the second in point of size, and seems to start from the southern side of the Bismarck range of Kaiser-Wilhelmland. It is navigable by steam launch for 120 miles. The Bailala and Lakckamu rise in undetermined mountains in the central main range. The Angabunga River has its origin from the western spurs of Mount Albert Edward; the Vanapa from the Owen Stanley Range, the Wharton Chain and the southern slopes of Mount Albert Edward; the Brown from the Owen Stanley Range east of Mount Victoria. On the northeast coast the rivers are all small, except four that open into the sea between Cape Nelson and the British-German boundary. These are, proceeding northwards, the Musa, Kumusi, Mambare, and Gira. Each of them pursues a course from the central main range towards the north-east until it enters the sea. The Gira rises from the eastern spurs of Mount Albert Edward, and is smaller than the other three, all of which are nearly of the same size.

Climate and Natural Resources.

As the colony lies between five and eleven and a half degrees of south latitude, the climate of the lower part of the country is warm. It is outside the range of the hurricanes that pervade the southern part of the Western Pacific. At Port Moresby, the seat of Government, and situated near the middle of the colony, the average temperature for the last four years at 9 a.m. was 80°. The average maximum readings for the same period, 86°65; the average minimum readings, 78°69. The extreme range of temperature is from 94° to 74° F. at 9 a.m. The greatest temperature registered by the maximum thermometer during the year ending with 30th June, 1903, was 93°6; the lowest by the minimum thermometer was 69°6 for 1903. The hot season is from November to May; the hottest months are January and February; the cold season is from June to October, the coldest month is August. During the hot season winds on the south coast are from the north and west, and are unsteady; during the cold season they are from the south-east, and are much more regular.

At Port Moresby the rainfall of the last seven years has averaged 41 inches; at Daru, in the western division, the average for the same period has been 94 inches. The measurements at Samarai, near the south-east end of the mainland, gave 126½ inches for one year. It is much greater, but undermined, on the central mountain ranges. On the south coast the climate is rather comfortable than oppressive during the cold season. It is generally agreeable at an altitude of 2,000 feet,
a height that can be reached on foot in one day from Port Moresby. At 5,000 to 6,000 feet it becomes distinctly cold at night, the thermometer sometimes reading 55° F.; at 10,000 feet ice is met with in the early morning. Above that the grass is often covered with hoar frost, and the cold is severe.

Malarial fever, of a type that is as a rule comparatively mild, is not rare in the low parts of the country. About the time of the change of seasons inflammatory diseases of the chest frequently occur among natives.

There exists there the obstinate scaly ringworm, common in many parts of the Pacific. A mild form of Yaws, not nearly so severe as it is in the Pacific Islands, is indigenous. Sporadic cases of elephantiasis and leprosy are met with, but these have not affected any European. Lupus and simple ulcers are common, and rheumatism is not unknown. Beriberi is also met with in some districts. There is no scarlet fever, croup or diphtheria. Typhoid fever, smallpox, and Asiatic cholera have not been introduced into the colony, but unfortunately dysentery has. Only one case of cancer has been seen in the country. Such diseases as tape-worm and guinea-worm are unknown.

The climate is favourable to the cultivation of all tropical products. The cocoanut palm bears well everywhere, and is common anywhere along the coast line, but in the far interior it is not met with. Cotton would be specially suited to the dry climate of the central district. Tobacco, in certain localities, of superior quality, and sugar cane seem to be indigenous or to be long domesticated; there are several native trees and plants that yield good classes of rubber. There are some good varieties of timber, including sandalwood, ebony, and cedar. Tea, cocoa, and coffee thrive well, but are not indigenous; the latter has been introduced and propagated. The climate is very congenial to rice and maize and all kinds of tropical fruit. The mineral deposits comprise gold, which exist over a large area; oesmiridium, which has been found from the Gira River to the Owen Stanley Range; and in the Purari sandstone district there is coal.

The marine resources comprise pearl-shell and pearls, trepang, sponges, and turtle shell.

Fauna and Flora.

There are no dangerous wild beasts in the Colony; wild swine are common. There are several varieties of wallaby, phalanger, and echidna. There are no deer, hares, or rabbits. The most dangerous creature is the crocodile; many lives are lost each year through these amphibians and by snake-bite. The snakes are nearly related to those of Australia. The birds include the cassowary, many birds of paradise, a great variety of pigeons, the hornbill, the black and the white cockatoo, geese, many species of ducks, quails, and on the mountain tops, snipe and woodcock.

The flora is as varied as the climate. On the tops of the highest mountain chains there are many species of grasses: several kinds of buttercup, forget-me-nots, daisies, rhododendrons, heaths, and other flowers of temperate climates. The forest there is principally cypress. From seven to ten thousand feet it is chiefly myrtaceous, often covered by trailing bamboo or mixed with pandanus. From two to five thousand feet the evergreen oaks are common. On the low lands there are several varieties of hardwood trees, afzelia bijuga, calophyllum, &c. Native cloth is made by beating out the bark of the paper mulberry, of the bread fruit tree, or of certain trees of the nettle family. Fibre is obtained from the banana, the cocoanut, from the bark of many saplings, and the best of all from the aerial roots of certain species of pandanus. Most of the trees and flowers that are met with in the tropical islands of the Pacific, or in North Queensland, occur also in British New Guinea.

The People.

All the native tribes of the Colony that have up to now been met with seem to belong to the same race; they present, however, well-marked differences in physical appearance, disposition, language and customs, but not greater than the circumstances would lead one to expect. No clear trace of an older or earlier race than the existing one has been discovered. The present inhabitants doubtless arrived in the country when it was already covered by dense forest; this must have had its effect in separating the people into secluded, shy, and suspicious communities. To this is due the notable diversities so common between the communities of even adjacent districts, each being confined strictly to its own small territory, subject to circumscribed local influences. Thus, for example, the tribes on the Fly and other estuaries have, for generations, had only brackish water; others water running over calcareous formation, or over slate, lava, granite, &c., a circumstance that would perhaps differentiate quite as much as the great variety of food. Some tribes live almost exclusively on sago, others on yams and taro, some on bananas, others principally on sweet potatoes. Many tribes live continuously in a heavy, moist, warm atmosphere near the coast line; others in the light and bracing climate of the mountains at an altitude of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The average size of a Papuan is less than that of an average European. The race affinities with the Pacific are strong; on the coast line there is a small percentage of a smooth-haired Malay-like element that is absent in the interior. The isolation of the different communities has led to such diversities of dialect that people living only a few miles apart cannot understand each other's speech. There is a well-marked relationship to the languages of Polynesia, and this extends, especially in place names, right across the colony, but it becomes weaker in ordinary language as one proceeds towards the west. The dialects are easy to acquire, containing as they do few or no sounds that cannot be represented by the English alphabet, or easily pronounced by an English-speaking person. English is now making considerable progress. The European population is about 500; the native population is estimated at about 350,000. There has been, however, no census. The country and people have no history, and but few current well-defined traditions. These refer to only local movements and actions of tribes within the last four or five generations.

Mode of Government.

The Possession has the constitution of a Crown colony, regulated by Royal letters patent of 8th June, 1888, under which the Government is carried on by an Administrator, with the advice and assistance of an executive and a legislative council. The correspondence of the Administrator of British New Guinea with the Secretary of State
passed first through the Governor of Queensland, and afterwards through the Governor-General of Australia. By Letters Patent, of 18th March, 1902, provision is made for placing the Possession under the authority of the Commonwealth, and for the revocation of the Letters Patent governing the present Constitution as soon as the Commonwealth Parliament has provided by law for the future government. There was no form of Government among the native population, the Polynesian system of chiefs being practically unknown; patriarchal authority did not extend beyond near family relatives, and even then was only loose. A certain measure of chiefly influence is being created now by a few men under Government authority, but control over the natives is being best acquired by the gradual creation of a force of village policemen. The Administration has at its disposal an armed constabulary, consisting of about 150 natives, enrolled from many different districts. Special laws have been passed for the protection of the native population, and for dealing with lands. A code consisting of a series of simple regulations, which are from time to time being added to, has also been passed for the benefit of the native population. The general law of the Possession is the same as that of Queensland. The courts of the Possession consist of the Central, Petty Sessions, and Native Magistrates' Courts.

Manufactures and Industries.

There are no European manufactories in the colony.

The chief industry worked by Europeans is gold mining. The number of miners has varied at different times from 100 to 800 men. Gold to the value of over £26,648, was declared at the custom house in 1900-1901 for export. It was nearly all obtained by alluvial mining. The gold-bearing country is extensive, but it is for various reasons very difficult to prospect. There are also indications of auriferous reefs, and three crushing plants have been established on Woodland Island. The pearl-shell fishery is of considerable importance; pearl-shell was exported in 1900-01 to the value of £5,676. The shell is widely distributed over the eastern seas of the colony, but large areas of water are difficult to work on account of their depth. Beche-de-mer is found on most of the reefs, and will always figure as a small industry. Sandalwood to the value of £8,382, was exported in 1903-4. It is sometimes found in the form of large trees, so far only in the central district on the mainland. It commands a fair price in the market. The rubber industry is already important, but promises to become greatly more so. The indigenous trees alone yield this article at the present time, but both soil and climate would no doubt be favourable to the better sorts of foreign rubber. The indigenous rubber commands a comparatively high price in the London market. Up to the last few years no systematic efforts had been made to plant cocoanuts. The old trees are only in small clumps, except in a few instances, and in those exceptional cases the groves are the property of large communities, who make extensive use of the cocoanut as an article of food. Many nuts are now being planted, but the amount available for coprah-making is not likely to exceed annually some 400 or 500 tons for some time. There are large sago fields in the colony, but this article has not yet been worked for export. There can be no reasonable doubt that the sugar cane, which is indigenous and present in a great many varieties, and cotton, coffee, tea, vanilla, and tobacco, which is domesticated, and of exceptionally fine quality, will eventually be made into great industries. Three coffee plantations and one tobacco plantation have been established.

External Trade.

The customs tariff is comparatively a light one; ad valorem duties do not exceed 10 per cent. The external trade of the colony is chiefly with Queensland and New South Wales. There are no direct shipments to or from Great Britain. The external trade, imports and exports, as entered at the customs, amounted in 1903-1904 to £53,138. Two steamers, of 2,400 tons register, trade regularly with the Possession, starting from Sydney and calling at Samarai, and proceeding thence to New Britain, back to Samarai, and thence to Port Moresby, Thursday Island, and then to Singapore, calling at the same ports on the return voyage. The whole time occupied by the voyage to and fro is three months. There are also trading schooners from Cooktown and Thursday Island. The coasting and general inter-island trade is carried on by means of four small steamers and some small cutters or luggers, many of which are manned exclusively by Papuans. There are suitable substantial wharves for working cargo at Port Moresby and Samarai, at which places all manner of supplies are obtainable at reasonable prices. No macadamised roads have been constructed. Much of the internal communication will be made by the rivers. Tracks have been cut in many directions, and the natives are becoming accustomed to travel alone or with Europeans over great areas. During the south-east trades, travelling by small boat is uncomfortable and difficult west of Yule Island, where there is no barrier reef; but east of that the coast is largely protected. East of Yule Island harbours and good anchorages are numerous. In the interior travelling is done always on foot, but in the central district horses can be used on many tracks.

Political Divisions.

The colony is divided into six magisterial divisions, in each of which there is a resident magistrate, who is also invested with the executive authority of dealing in the first instance with any administrative matter that may arise. Besides these there are assistant resident magistrates with limited judicial powers in certain more populous districts. The Central Court, which possesses the jurisdiction of an ordinary Supreme Court, sits wherever there is occasion. The principal seat of Government is at Port Moresby. This place is centrally situated. It is easy to approach the harbour, and the latter is large, commodious, and sheltered from all winds. The population of Port Moresby consists of about 1,600 natives and some three score of Europeans. It is not well-watered, but is very picturesque, and comparatively healthy. The immediate neighbourhood is not well suited for ordinary cultivation on account of the rather scanty rainfall. Port Moresby is a port of entry.

Samarai, the next place in importance, is an island of some sixty acres four or five miles from the south-east end of the mainland. There is no native village on that island. It is a port of entry, and the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate of the district. The European population is
always greater than at Port Moresby. There is good anchorage there, but no convenient water supply. It is the port from which miners, pearl fishers, &c., generally obtain their supplies. Like Port Moresby, the neighbourhood of Samarai is very picturesque. Its rainfall is nearly three times as great as at the former place.

The third port of entry for the colony is the island of Daru, the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate for the Western Division. It has a good and safe harbour, with an approach that presents no difficulty. It is the only harbour the colony possesses in the west, and the island supplies the best building sites obtainable in that part of the country. It is visited by many boats engaged in the pearl-shell fishery of Torres Straits.

Summary.

British New Guinea differs from all other countries in its newness. A large part of the interior is still in the stone age, much of it is in a stage of transition in which the stone axe and the steel tomahawk are used side by side. The aboriginal methods of house-building, of canoe-making, of pottery manufacture, of cultivation, are still generally maintained. About half of the coast line has been brought under missionary influence, and there are two or three stations on the larger rivers.

Four missionary societies are established in the Possession. They are the London Missionary Society, which has for its field the south coast of New Guinea; the Society of the Sacred Heart, which is established at Yule Island, and along the banks of the St. Joseph River; the Australian Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, which extends its influence over all the archipelago; and the Church of England Mission which has as its field the north-east coast of New Guinea. The last-named constituting the Diocese of New Guinea, organised under a Bishop of the Church of England. The two first-named societies were in New Guinea before annexation was proclaimed: the last two have come there since the proclamation of sovereignty. The native population take readily to civilisation in most great matters, while they often cling tenaciously to their own habits and customs in smaller and less important things.

Nearly all Europeans in the Colony give their attention to trading or to gold mining, while very few give much time or labour to agriculture, with the result that cultivation by Europeans has made but very little progress though land has been procurable at a very small price. Europeans can and do work hard at gold mining, but they probably could not do so in the open fields.
