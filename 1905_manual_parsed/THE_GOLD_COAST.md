THE GOLD COAST.

(See Map under head of Lagos.)

THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast Colony, with Ashanti and the Protected Northern Territories, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, between 3° 7' W. long. and 1° 14' E. long., and is bounded on the west by the French settlements of Assinie, on the east by the German colony of Togoland, on the north by the 11th degree of N. lat., and on the south by the sea.

The area of the Colony is 24,200 square miles, of Ashanti, 20,000, and of the Northern Territories, 35,800.

The country is inhabited by a large number of native tribes more or less independent of each other, but with similar customs and forms of government. Each tribe has its own head chief or king, and every town or village of the tribe a chief. The chiefs form the king's council, and assist him in dealing with matters affecting the general welfare of the tribe. The succession both to the king's and chiefs' stools is for the most part hereditary by the female side, the heir to the stool being the son of the occupant's eldest sister, or failing male offspring by his sisters, his brothers according to seniority, and back from them to the male offspring of his aunts on the father's side.

The principal coast tribes are the following:—Appollonia, Ahanta, Shama, Kommanda, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winneba, Assin Gomoa, Accra, Adangme, Awuna, Agbosome and Affiao. Some of these, on account of tribal differences, are split up into divisions more or less independent of each other, and as education and civilisation spread, a tendency to further disintegration develops itself.

In the interior the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wassaw, Sefwhi, upper and lower Denkera, Tofel, Assin, Essikuma, Ejumako, eastern and western Akem, Akwapem, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepri, Kwahu, Atabubu, Shai, Ningo, Krikor, and Anum.

For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into three provinces, each presided over by a Provincial Commissioner. These Provinces are further divided into districts, presided over by District Commissioners. All these Officers not only perform judicial duties as magistrates, but also have charge of the Executive of their district.

The districts are as follows:—

1. Western province:—districts—Sefwi and upper Denkyira, Axim, Dixcove, Sekondi, Wassaw.
2. Central province:—Districts—Elmina, Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winneba.
3. Eastern province:—Districts—Accra, Prampram, Adda, Volta River, Okwawu & Eastern Akyem, Keta.

History.

The Gold Coast, with the adjacent territories bordering on the Gulf of Guinea, first became known to Europeans by the enterprise of Portuguese and French navigators in the 14th century. The first European Settlement on the Gold Coast was in 1482, when the fort San Jorge de Mina (Elmina) was built and garrisoned by the Portuguese, who subsequently made several other settlements, and obtained Papal authority for their occupation of the country. During the reign of Elizabeth of England, the Dutch established themselves on the coast, and their rivalry was so successful that they eventually terminated the Portuguese occupation by the capture of Elmina in 1637, and of Fort Anthony at Axim in 1642. The first English Expeditions to the Coast were made in the reign of Edward I, but were all of the nature of private ventures. The "Company of Adventurers of London trading into Africa" incorporated in 1618, led to the establishment of the first British Settlement at Kormantine. A second company was formed in 1626, and a third in 1662, and settlements were made at Cape Corso (Cape Coast), Anomabo, and Accra, the main object of these companies, as well as those of the other European nations, being traffic in slaves. Three other European nations succeeded in acquiring territories on the Gold Coast, viz.:—The Swedes, the Brandenburghers, and the Danes. The first-mentioned built the fort of Christiansborg, near Accra about 1645, but were driven out by the Danes in 1657, and retired from the Coast. The Brandenburghers established "Fort Great Fredericksburg" at Princes River in 1682, and "Fort Dorothea" at Akwada in 1685, but their enterprise does not seem to have been prosecuted with much vigour, and was finally abandoned in 1720, their possessions falling into the hands of the Dutch. The Danes, however, after first selling the Fort at Christiansborg to the Portuguese, and re-buying it three years later, rapidly improved their position, building forts at several stations to the East of Accra, as far as Adda and Kitts, and exercising a kind of Protectorate over Akwapem, and the Volta River district.

The third English Company was not successful. The Dutch traders spared no efforts to get rid of their rivals, and in consequence of their aggression,
an expedition was sent by Charles II. in 1663, under the command of Captain Holmes, which recaptured Cape Coast, taken a few years previously by the Dutch, and all the other Dutch forts, with the exception of Elmina and Axim. In the following year, however, the Dutch Commander de Ruyter recaptured all the lost Dutch forts, with the exception of Cape Coast; and the treaty of Breda, 1667, left affairs in the Gold Coast in this condition. The fourth English Company was incorporated in the year 1672 under the name of the "Royal African Company of England." Under its influence English interests steadily advanced, and forts were established at Dixcove, Sekundu, Kommenda, Anomabo, Tantumkweri, Winneba, Accra. The abolition of the exclusive privileges which the Royal African Company enjoyed, led to its decline and eventual dissolution in 1752. By the Acts of Parliament 23 George II., c. 31, and 25 George II., c. 40, a fifth trading Corporation, called the "African Company of Merchants" was formed, the membership of which was open to all British traders on payment of a fee of 40/-, compensation being paid for its charter, and property to the Royal African Company. An annual subsidy was granted by Parliament to the newly-formed Company, until 1821, when by the Act 1 & 2 George IV., c. 28, the Company was dissolved and its possessions vested in the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlement, the seat of government being at Sierra Leone.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Ensimankao, where, on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Accra, in 1827. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831, between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4,000l. a year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his Government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast Protectorate. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the slave trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieutenant-Governor appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of native affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

Hitherto the forts of the various nations were intermixed with each other, and there was no defined limit as to where the influence of one or the other began or ended. The imposition of Customs duties was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by the existence of the free ports of a rival nation within a stone's throw, as it were, of the duty ports. On the 24th of January, 1850, by Letters Patent, the Settlements on the Gold Coast ceased to be dependencies of Sierra Leone, and in the same year, by the purchase of the forts and protectorate of the Danes, the Coast line from Christiansborg to Keta and the districts of Shai, eastern and western Krobo, Akwapem, Akwamu, and Krepi, were acquired by England. By a Commission dated the 19th February, 1866, the Gold Coast Settlements were reunited to the Colony of Sierra Leone under one Governor-in-Chief. In 1867, a convention was made with the Dutch by which the portion of the Coast lying to the west of the Sweet River, which flows into the sea between Cape Coast and Elmina, was allotted to Holland, England taking all the territory to the east of the river, and a customs union between the two nations was established. The Dutch, however, found many difficulties in the way of their occupation of the forts and possessions received from the English in exchange for those of their own lying to the East of the boundary line. The native tribes refused to recognise their authority, and the prospect before them was that of a long series of petty wars with no reasonable hope of profit to be gained in the future. The result was the convention made between England and Holland in 1871, by which the Dutch transferred all their forts and possessions on the Coast to the English, and Great Britain obtained at last the sole sovereignty and control of the territory from Axim to Volta. The forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872. The present extent and limits of the colony are defined in the Order in Council of 1901.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by Letters Patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Four unofficial members have been appointed to the Legislative Council.

The Supreme Court of the Colony was a Court of Appeal for Lagos, and also under the West African Order in Council, 1884, but legislation providing for the establishment of separate courts of appeal in each colony was passed in 1888.

**Law and Justice.**

The Law of the Colony is the Common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England, on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed at various periods since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Ordinance passed in 1876.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court presided over by the Chief Justice, Divisional Courts held in different parts of the colony by four puisne judges, and thirteen inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction presided
over by District Commissioners. The Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and decides appeals from the inferior courts in civil matters, while the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decisions of the Commissioners in criminal cases. Appeals from Divisional Courts are heard by a full court.

Native law is administered in all the Courts, in as far as it is not incompatible with any Statute or Ordinance, and not repugnant to natural justice.

The Forts of St. James at Accra, St. Jago at Elmina, and Cape Coast Castle are utilised as prisons, and a central prison is in course of construction at Sekondi.

At Accra convicts are taught trades, remunerative industries are carried on, and the English penal system is carried out in a modified form.

Climate.

The climate is very unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The death rate among the non-official European population is difficult to ascertain, but the rate per 1,000 is believed to have been, in 1891, 32·7; in 1892, 70·7; in 1893, 64·93; in 1894, 19·6; in 1895, 59·02; 48·78 in 1896; 93·92 in 1897; 37·52 in 1898; 45·0 in 1899; 15·91 in 1900; 29·09 in 1901; 30·11 in 1902; and 25·57 in 1903.* Among the European officials the death rate per 1,000 was 30·7 in 1891; 36·3 in 1892; 31·25 in 1893; 33·7 in 1894; 33·33 in 1895; 60·10 in 1896; 37·5 in 1897; 36·36 in 1898; 54·2 in 1899; 33·23 in 1900; 79·78 in 1901; 34·96 in 1902; and 15·33 in 1903. No data are at hand for estimating the death rate among the natives. Infant mortality is great. The mean temperature in the shade at Accra averages 85° F. The average annual rainfall at the same place is about 26 inches. The rainfall varies with the physical configuration of the country, and is very great in Axim and the mining districts of Tarkwa, Upper and Lower Wassaw, etc. The "first rains," or rainy season proper, begin in March and end in July, the "latter rains" are spread over the months of September and October. The Harmattan season begins in December and ends in February. It is characterised by a cool wind which is sometimes dry and bracing, but often moist, and then very depressing. The climate generally is hot and moist, and very malarious.

Domestic Slavery.

Domestic slavery existed from time immemorial on the Gold Coast, as in other parts of Africa, the slave population consisting partly of native-born slaves, and partly of Donkos, slaves purchased from Ashanti importers. Slavery was mainly an emanation of parental authority, every man being saleable either by his father or mother, according to the character of the union subsisting between his parents, and the consequent status of the mother; but there was also a species of slavery called pawning, founded on contract, which arose when a debtor gave to his creditor, as a security, either himself, or a child or slave, to be a temporary slave in the hands of the creditor until debt and interest were paid.

Within the British possessions on the Gold Coast, slavery was abolished by force of the statute 3 & 4 Will. IV., c.73, but no attempt had been made to deal with it in the Protectorate, which was not affected by that statute. The harsher usages of slavery were, however, appreciably mitigated by the action of the court of the "Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs" and other magistrates. At the conclusion of the war of 1873-4 the question was taken in hand anew by the newly-established Legislative Council at its first meeting, and settled by two ordinances. One of these prohibits, under penalties, the introduction of slaves into the Protectorate, and the buying and selling, and pawnment of slaves and other persons within the Protectorate; and the second declares, that henceforth no court, native or British, shall take notice of, so as to give effect to, the relations between master and slave, except in so far as those relations may be in accordance with the law of England relating to master and servant.

MAIL AND STEAMSHIP SERVICES.

The British and African Steam Navigation Co. (1900), Ltd., and African Steamship Company.

Mail steamers of these companies leave Liverpool every Saturday calling at Sierra Leone, Monrovia, Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast and Accra, the length of the voyage being 15 to 16 days.

These companies also despatch cargo steamers every alternate Wednesday and fourth Thursday from Liverpool, the Wednesday steamers calling at the principal Gold Coast ports and the Thursday steamers at all Gold Coast ports outwards and homewards. Length of the voyage, Liverpool to Accra, varies from 30 to 37 days.

On the 15th of each month a steamer leaves Hamburg and calls at the principal Gold Coast ports, length of voyage being about 30 days.

Homewards, the mail steamers of these companies call at Accra every Tuesday, also calling at Cape Coast, Sekondi and Axim. The length of the voyage, Accra to Plymouth, by these steamers is 17 days.

The steamers of these companies call at the Canary Islands or Madeira homewards.

Compagnie Belge Maritime du Congo.

The steamers of this company sailing outwards from Antwerp call at Southampton every third Friday for passengers for Teneriffe, Sierra Leone, Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast and Accra, the length of the voyage, Southampton to Accra, being 14 days. These steamers also call at Accra on the homeward voyage every third Saturday, and at the other above-named ports in reverse order, the length of the passage, Accra to Southampton, being 14 days.

Woermann Line.

A mail steamer of this line outwards from Hamburg calls at Southampton on 12th of each month for passengers for the principal Gold Coast ports, length of the voyage, Southampton to Accra, being 16 days. Cargo steamers of this line leave Hamburg on 1st, 7th, 20th and 22nd of each month, calling at most ports on the Gold Coast, the voyage to Accra varying from 25 to 32 days.

Two of this Company's steamers leave Accra on 14th and 27th of each month homewards, calling also at Cape Coast, Sekondi and Axim for mails and passengers, the voyage, Accra to Southampton, taking about 16 days.

Cargo steamers of one or two French Companies sailing from Marseilles call irregularly outwards and homewards at Gold Coast ports.

Note: The above steamship services were in operation in August, 1904. In details they are liable to frequent changes.

Internal Communication.

The construction of a railway from Sekondi to Tarkwa, a distance of about 40 miles, was commenced in February, 1898. The rails reached Tarkwa on the 17th April, 1901, and in July of that year an extension was started from that point, the lines reaching Obuase (124 miles) by the end of 1902, and Kumase on 1st October, 1903. The receipts were £13,435/., in 1891, £9,438/., in 1902, £65,965/., in 1903, and are rapidly increasing.

The roads in the Colony that are maintained by the Department of Public Works are as follows:—

In the Axim district: Axim to the Ankobra, 3½ miles; in the Tarkwa district: Tarkwa to Daman, 23 miles; Tarkwa to Himan, 24 miles; Tarkwa to Bonsa, 14 miles. In the Cape Coast district: Cape Coast to Anomabo, 11½ miles; Cape Coast to Elmina, 8 miles; Cape Coast to Jukwa, 14½ miles; Cape Coast to Kumase, 14½ miles. In the Saltpond District: Saltpond to Mankessim, 5 miles. In the Winneba District: Winneba to Soedru, 14½ miles; Soedru to Asafo, in the Accra and Volto Districts: Accra to Aburi, 26 miles; Accra to Dodowa, 25 miles; Accra to Sansama, 24½ miles; Tinkraniko to Pong, 9¾ miles. In the Kitta district: Anyako to Sasaaki, 36 miles; Afianigba to Whenyi, 15 miles; Dogblu to Dogplata, 23 miles.

In addition to these there are numerous native roads, which are kept clear of bush and passable for traders and travellers by the local chiefs, who are paid by the Government for this purpose 10s. a quarter per mile. Of these the most worthy of mention are the road from Aburi through Apasare and Kofrodua to Osino, the Western frontier road running through Aowin and Sefwi to Wam and British Gaman; the road from Cape Coast to Asafo and Debisu, via Mampong; the roads from Saltpond, Appam and Winneba to Insuain in Western Akym; the roads from Aburi, through Akwapem and Krobo, to Akuse and Pong. A road has also been constructed from Accra to Kyebi by the Eastern Akym Gold Fields Co., with assistance from the Government. Kumase is the centre for the various routes to the Northern District. From it roads lead to Gambaga, via Kintampo, to Yeji and Prang, via Atabubu, to Wam and British Gaman, via Odumase and Berekum, and to Ahafo. It is also connected with the districts of the Colony by roads running into Sefwi and Akyem, as well as by the Cape Coast road mentioned above. Where rivers and swamps have to be crossed, ferries have been instituted, which are controlled for the most part by the Chiefs, who are empowered to levy a small fee. In some cases, where this arrangement has not given satisfaction, ferries are worked under direct Government supervision.

The principal waterway is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and flows into the sea at Ada, after a course of 200 miles. It is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse, and, with the exception of the Krakyi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. As this route is the most direct to the Northern Territories, a transport service has been organised by the Government for this purpose. The Ankobra River has been largely used for transport purposes to the mines in the Prestea and Himan Districts, and is navigable for many months of the year by surf boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assini, by the main lagoon, and by a tramway, three miles in length, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tanoso, a distance of about 60 miles. Rapids at Attakwabo prevent this river being further utilised.

There is no harbour along the whole coast of the Colony, and passengers and goods are landed in surf-boats.

The best landings are at Dixcove, Axim and Sekondi, while the surf is most dangerous at Adda, Saltpond, and the Apollonia Coast.

A Transport Department has been working for three years at Sekondi and Cape Coast, under the direction of the Government. Arrangements can be made for the conveyance of goods and mining material to any part of the Colony by this Department, at a fixed tariff.

Postal Communication.

The Colony is included in the Postal Union. Foreign money order and parcel post systems are in operation between it and the United Kingdom, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Lagos, and Southern and Northern Nigeria. An inland postal order system is in existence. A tri-weekly postal service is maintained between all the principal Coast stations and by rail between Sekondi and Kumase; a weekly service between Kumase and Kintampo and Gambaga, and between Kumase, Attabubu, and Salaga in the Northern Territories; between the Colony and the French Ivory Coast; and a bi-weekly service between the Colony and the German protectorate of Togoland. The number of letters, etc., posted and received in 1903 was 3,749,982.

The rates of postage are as follows:—

| For News, Books, and other Printed Papers, per 2 oz. | 1d. | ½d. | ¼d. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|
| For a reply-paid Postcard.                        |     | 2½d.| 1½d.|

Money Order commission, 2d. on every 10s.

Telegraphs and Telephones.

Telegraphs were first introduced in 1882, when a line 2½ miles in length was constructed between Accra and Christiansborg. This was in 1885 extended to Aburi, distant 25 miles. A line was next constructed along the coast from Accra to Axim, a distance of 180 miles, with intermediate stations at Winnebe, Appam, Saltpond, Anamaboe, Cape Coast, Elmina, Chama, Sekondi, Adja, and Dixcove. This has been duplicated, and in 1902 the system was extended from Axim to the French boundary at Newtown. Another line of about 114 miles in length extends from Accra to the Anglo-German frontier, where it joins the line of the German settlement of Togoland, with intermediate stations at Pram Pram, Ada, Kwitta, and Danoe. A third line strikes inland from Ada, and connects the towns of Akuse and Kpong, on the River Volta. A fourth has been constructed through the interior, starting at Cape Coast, and reaching as far as Bole, with intermediate stations at Manau, Prahus, Kumase, Nkoranza, Kintampo. A fifth line runs along the railway from Sekondi to Tarkwa, and will eventually be extended to Kumase. A line has been constructed connecting Accra with Kpong, via Ahui and Akropong. From this there is a branch line to Dodowa. The total length of lines constructed is, so far, 961 miles.

In 1893 the number of telegrams forwarded was 60,031; in 1895, 91,690; in 1897, 84,580; in 1899, 128,026; in 1900, 140,315; in 1901, 199,424; in 1902, 248,077; and 276,681 in 1903.

There are telephone exchanges at Accra and Cape Coast which provide communication between all the Government and some private offices.

Accra and Sekondi are in telegraphic communication with Europe—via Sierra Leone, St. Vincent, and Madeira—with Lagos, Brass, Bonny, Cameroons, and St. Thomas. They are also connected with the Cape, via Loanda and Mossamedes.

Defence Force.

A military force was raised by Captain Glover, R.N. (afterwards Sir John Glover), and Mr. (afterwards Sir Roger) Goldsworthy for service in the Ashanti War 1873-4, and was known as Glover's Haussa. The force was converted into Constabulary in 1879, and into a Regiment of Infantry and three Batteries of Artillery in 1901. The present establishment is two Battalions of Infantry and two Batteries of Artillery, and forms part of the West African Frontier Force.

Gold Coast Volunteers.

This corps was organised in 1892, and at present consists of two infantry companies and a European machine gun section at Accra, one infantry company and a European machine gun section at Cape Coast, and one infantry company and a European machine gun section at Axim.

Education.

Elementary education in the Colony is chiefly in the hands of the Wesleyan, Basel, Roman Catholic and Bremen Missionary Societies; these receive annual grants from the Government. The Government has established schools at Accra, Cape Coast, and Insuaim, in Western Akim; there is also a Government school at Accra in connection with the Civil Police force. The various missions have schools situated in outlying districts, reaching far into the interior. A scheme of technical education, under a European master, has been introduced into the Government school at Accra, and many of the mission schools in the interior have small plantations attached, where the scholars receive instruction in the cultivation of coffee and other native products. The Basel Mission has also established training schools for their teachers at Akropong and Abetifi, and at their head stations instruction is given in carpentry, masonry, bookbinding, and various other crafts.

In addition there are about 147 more schools which do not yet receive Government support.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling, with Spanish, American, and French gold coins, as fixed by Ordinance No. 2 of 1880. Gold dust was demonetised by Ordinance No. 9 of 1889, but still remains a medium of exchange in the districts of the interior. A number of United States silver half-dollars are in circulation, but are not legal tender. German gold and silver coins circulate in the Trans-Volta districts since the Customs Union. Copper coins are being gradually introduced through the agency of the native chiefs. Cowries are still in use, but only for the purchase of articles of little value. Accounts are kept in sterling. The Bank of British West Africa has establishments at Accra, Cape Coast, Sekondi, and Axim. It commenced business at those places on the 1st January, 1897, 22nd January, 1900, 1st July, 1901, and 21st October, 1901, respectively. In March, 1888, a Government savings bank was established, and
had, on the 31st December, 1901, a credit of £3,936l. 0s. 8d., in the names of 341 depositors. Penny Banks have also been established in the principal schools. The rate of exchange is at par.

**Population.**

The census returns for 1901 give the population of the Colony as 895,350; but the Census Committee estimated that, owing to the difficulty in obtaining information in the interior of the Colony, and the reluctance on the part of the natives to be enumerated, an addition of 148,000 should be made, thus bringing the total to 1,043,350. The returns for Ashanti give 335,651, and for the Northern Territories, 107,432. The populations of the chief towns on the coast are Accra, 17,892; Cape Coast Castle, 28,948; Ada, 13,240; Sekondi, 4,095; Kwitta, 3,018; and Axim, 2,189.

**Trade and Industries.**

The chief products of the Colony are palm oil, rubber, palm kernels, lumber, cocoas, kola and gold. Palm oil is used chiefly in the manufacture of soap and candles, and though for this reason its value fluctuates to some extent with the tallow market, the average value of the exports of this article is consistently high. The Volta River District is the most important centre for palm oil, on account of the facilities afforded by the river for transport to the coast. The oil is packed in casks, rolled to the river, towed by canoes to Akuse, and thence by launches to Addá for shipment to Europe. In other parts of the country, the casks are rolled along the road to the nearest sea-port. The value of the palm oil exported in 1903 amounts to £145,896l. against £236,211l. in 1902, and the average value for the previous ten years was £183,662l.

The value of rubber exports has fluctuated in the last few years. There are several reasons to account for this, viz.:—the low prices ruling in the European markets, the destruction of trees by unskilful tapping, the fact that rubber from the adjoining French and German Colonies no longer comes to Gold Coast ports, and the fact that a more profitable field for labour is offered by the numerous mining enterprises, a cause which has affected all staple products. Between 1891 and 1901, rubber was the most important export of the Colony, the value for 1899 amounting to £566,731l., and the average for the decade being £321,165l. In 1902, although 5½% more rubber was exported than in the previous year, the value was 15½% less. The value of this export, however, rose to £196,500l. in 1903, which represents an increase of 100% on the preceding year, although the increase in the amount shipped was less than 50%. 15,000 trees have been planted by the Botanical Department in forest land recently acquired by Government, and efforts are being made to instruct the natives in more scientific methods of tapping the trees and preparing the rubber for the market.

The export of palm kernels maintains a steady rate. In 1903 the value of the kernels exported was £106,272l., and the average for the 10 years previous was £93,097l. The price obtained for this product rose from 5½ per ton in 1886, to 8½ per ton in 1900, and the average price for the last three years has been over 7½ per ton.

The lumber trade is not as yet on a very sound basis. The value of the mahogany timber exported rose from 4l. in 1886, to £110,331l. in 1898, but had fallen in 1902 to £21,896l., and rose again in 1903 to £48,853l.; the average value for the ten years previous to 1903 being £63,318l. The cause of the decline is due to the fact that as the supply of good timber in the immediate vicinity of the rivers Ankobra and Tano become exhausted, it is necessary to go farther afield, and, without the waterways, transport to the coast is a matter of great difficulty.

The cultivation of cocoa was started in Akwapem in 1879, and the first exports in 1891 realised 4l. Coffee at that time fetched a fair price, and it was not until 1898, when the price for the latter article fell so low as to make its cultivation at any distance from the coast unremunerative, that attention was paid to cocoa. Since that year the cocoa industry has made rapid strides, and the exports in 1903 were valued at £86,250l.

The trade in kola nuts, which suffered greatly during the Ashanti disturbances, is showing signs of revival. The tree is found principally in Ashanti and Akyem, and the largest markets are at Bontuku (in French Territory), Kintampo, Salaga, and Pong, whence the kola nut is conveyed by caravans to the Hausa States in the Hinterland. Returns are not available for the amount of kola exported by these routes. Good trees have recently been planted by the Botanical Department, and increased attention is paid to its cultivation by the natives. The value of this product, exported by sea, amounted to £50,561l. in 1903.

Gold has been exported from the Gold Coast more or less continuously since the discovery of the country by Europeans in the fifteenth century. Up to 1874, however, the industry was almost entirely in the hands of the natives. The first company for gold mining in West Africa was founded in 1874, but did little beyond exploration. A second company, formed in 1879, engaged in mining operations in the neighbourhood of Tarkwa, and from that year the progress of mining enterprise is indicated by the rapid increase in the exports of gold bars, the result of European operations, as compared with those of gold dust, the produce of native mining. In 1899 there was a very remarkable development of the mining industry, which, though checked for a while by the disturbances in Ashanti, received a fresh impetus from the passing of the Concessions Ordinance in 1900, the progress of the railway, and general improvement in means of transport. The amount of gold exported in 1903, viz., £264,790l., was greatly in excess of any previous year. The average for the ten years prior to 1903 was £69,058l. The number of companies holding concessions is 61.

Gold is widely diffused throughout the Colony, Ashanti, and some parts of the Northern Territories, in quartz deposits and alluvial deposits, while in Wassaw there is good conglomerate or banket formation. The rivers are said to be rich in alluvial deposits. Bitumen is found along the banks of the river Bonni, in Apollonia, and the stream Akyikyiri, flowing into the Ewiano lagoon near Half Assini. About three-quarters of the total export is with the United Kingdom, the rest being chiefly with Germany, France and Holland. The quantities
and values of the principal exports for 1903 were:

Up to the year 1894, the exports of the Colony exceeded the imports. Since that year, however, the imports have been greater than the exports, the proportion in 1903 being 2 to 1. The United Kingdom holds the bulk of the import trade with 64%; Germany is second with 13%, and the United States third with about 3%. The first in value of the imports are cotton goods, with provisions second, and wines and spirits third. The imports of machinery have improved in the last few years with the advance of the mining enterprise. The majority of the imports are subject to an ad valorem duty of 10%. Specific duties are imposed on a few articles, such as spirits, tobacco, gunpowder, &c. The Customs receipts come to more than three-quarters the total revenue of the Colony.

Native manufactures are insignificant. Clothes are woven in many parts of the country, for the most part of English spun yarn, but in the northern districts occasionally of thread manufactured from the indigenous cotton plant. Narrow strips of four to six inches are woven on a rough hand loom, and stitched together to make clothes of various sizes. Gold and brass are worked by native smiths; canoes are made on the coast rivers; pottery for domestic purposes is made by hand, and wood-carving is done chiefly in Ashanti and Okwawu. Salt is roughly prepared from the lagoons between Accra and Keta, and sent up country to the markets of the Northern Territories. Fishing is extensively carried on along the coast, and large quantities of sun-dried fish are sent to the villages and markets of the interior.

Agriculture is the staple occupation of the interior. The chief food crops are yam, cassada, maizi, amankani, a species of eddoc, plantain, and, in some districts, rice. The soil is very productive, and the methods of cultivation crude. In April, 1890, a Botanical Station was established at Aburi, where the Government Sanatorium stands, at an elevation of 1,600 feet above sea level, and a Curator from the Royal Gardens, Kew, appointed, the object in view being to teach the natives the most approved methods of planting, and preparing their produce for the home markets. Forty-four acres were acquired for this purpose, and these were divided into plots and planted with rubber, kola, coffee fibres, cotton, cocoa, spices, vanillas, peppers, timber trees and various other ornamental and economic plants. Plant shelters were made to raise seedling plants, and these now cover an area of more than an acre. Thousands of plants are raised annually and distributed to European and native planters. In 1900 an Assistant Curator was appointed, and the Curator sent to various parts of the Colony to instruct the natives in the proper methods of cultivation of rubber, cocoa, &c. Hundreds of cocoa plantations were formed in different parts of the country, and the success of this enterprise has greatly increased the influence of the Botanical Department by winning the confidence of the native planter. A bronze medal was received from the Paris Exhibition in 1900 for cocoas grown and cured at the Botanic Garden, Aburi. At Christiansborg 8,000 cocoanuts have been planted, to encourage the natives in the cultivation of this palm, for the production of copra and coir. An exchange seed list was established in 1900, and has been the means of the introduction of hundreds of valuable plants into the Colony. To increase the native interest in agriculture, instruction, both theoretical and practical, is given to school teachers, and a grant paid to schools which have a plot of land attached which is used for giving instruction in agriculture.

ASHANTI.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwans, Juabins, Kokofus, Kumases, Daniassiss, Mampons, Nautas, Nkwantas, Dadiassiss, Ofinasus, and Adjusaes. Each tribe has its own king, but from time immemorial the King of Kumase was recognised as the King paramount of the Confederation. As King paramount, he succeeded to what was known as the "golden stool," the ceremony of enstoolment lasting several weeks, and being observed by the performance of native customs, which in times past consisted largely in the sacrifice of slaves.

In 1873 the King of Ashanti invaded the British Protectorate with a large army, and reached Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the British forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing. Later in the year Captain (afterwards Sir) John Glover was sent to the eastern districts of the Protectorate to organise the tribes in that quarter, for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, now Viscount, Wolseley was despatched to the Gold Coast, with British and West Indian troops, native levies, and some seamen and marines, to operate against the Ashantis, starting from Cape Coast. On the 31st of January, 1874, he came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoafu, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Kumase. The King had fled to the bush. A few days later Sir John Glover also reached Kumase. On the 13th, messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommanna, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fommanna, the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold.

In 1894 Prempeh, who was then King of Kumase, and had successfully fought against the Nkoranzas, who had revolted against his rule,
threatened to attack the Atabubus. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Kumase. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and a military expedition accordingly proceeded to Kumase, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Kumase without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmina Castle. A Resident was at the same time installed at Kumase, and thus commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

In 1900 the Governor visited Kumase, and was there besieged by the Ashantis, the town being closely invested. Provisions ran short, and a part of the garrison, with the Governor, cut their way out; the rest were relieved by Colonel (afterwards Sir J.) Willcocks, commanding the Ashanti Field Force, on 15th July, after severe fighting. The Ashantis were subsequently thoroughly routed at Obassa.

An Order of the King in Council, dated September 26th, 1901, defined the boundaries of Ashanti, annexed it to His Majesty's Dominions, and provided for its administration under the Government of the Gold Coast. Effect was given to this Order in Council by the enactment, on 1st January, 1902, of the "Ashanti Administration Ordinance," which places Ashanti under a Chief Commissioner, with Commissioners of Districts under him. These districts are called the Central, Southern, North-Western, and North-Eastern Districts, and have head-quarters at Kumase, Kwissa, Sikassiko and Atabubu. Courts of Justice were established at each of these stations, with appeal to the Court of the Chief Commissioner.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES.

In 1897 the territories to the north of Ashanti were constituted a separate district with the title of "The Northern Territories," and placed in charge of a Commissioner, and a grant-in-aid of the expenditure in the Northern Territories was voted by Parliament.

Major H. P. Northcott was appointed Commissioner and Commandant of these territories, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The negotiations between the British and French Governments for the settlement of territorial questions in West Africa, which had been suspended in 1896, were resumed in October, 1897; and on 14th June, 1898, after a period of considerable tension in consequence of the proximity of the British and French forces in the disputed territories, a Convention was signed at Paris with a proviso that it should be ratified within six (subsequently extended to twelve) months. By this Convention the boundary between the Gold Coast and the French Colony of the Ivory Coast, which had only been settled in 1889, as far as the 9th parallel of north latitude, was continued northwards along the course of the Black Volta River to the 11th parallel, and it was then drawn along the 11th parallel with a deflection to the north in the neighbourhood of Mamprusi, until it met the Franco-German boundary of 1897. The effect of the Anglo-French Convention of 14th June, 1898, was to leave Bona, Lobi, and Moshi to France, while Dagarti, Wa, Mamprusi, and the southern portion of Gurunshi were included in the British sphere.

On 14th November, 1899, an agreement was concluded with Germany for the partition of the "neutral zone." This partition assigned Salaga, to Great Britain, and Yendi to Germany, and to the north of the zone gave Mamprusi to the former and Chakosi to the latter.

Survey operations were undertaken by Anglo-French and Anglo-German Commissions during 1901-2, for the delimitation of those portions of the boundaries which had not yet been settled. These operations are still in progress.

Provision was made for the administration of the Northern Territories under the Gold Coast Government by an Order of the King in Council of 26th September, 1901, and by an Administrative Ordinance of January 1st, 1902, the Northern Territories were placed under a Chief Commissioner, and divided into the White Volta, Black Volta, Kintampo and Gonga Districts with headquarters at Gambega, Wa, Kintampo and Salaga. These Districts are presided over by Commissioners, who are responsible to the Chief Commissioner, and have Courts of Justice, with appeal to the Chief Commissioner at Gambega.
