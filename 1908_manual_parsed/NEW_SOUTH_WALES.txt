NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The State of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 37th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 154th meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the State of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the State follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the State is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the State follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary,
Dumaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,367 square miles, or 198,434,880 acres, being a little over two and a half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 195,669,030 acres, or about 305,733 square miles.

The length of the State, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 680 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 760 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 42" E. long.

Of the total area of the State, 49,415,883 acres have been alienated, or are in the process of alienation.

The number of Alienated Holdings over one acre in extent for the year ended 31st March, 1907, were:

| Acres | No. |
|-------|-----|
| 1 to 30 | 26,094 |
| 31 to 400 | 36,724 |
| 401 to 1,000 | 9,481 |
| 1,001 to 10,000 | 5,998 |
| 10,001 and upwards | 729 |

Total | 79,026 |

**History.**

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, at Port Jackson, under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1800 was 4,958. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 36,598. Convicts ceased to arrive in 1841. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland. On the 1st January, 1901, the Colony of New South Wales united with the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, in a Federal Commonwealth of Australia.

**Climate.**

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade in 1906 was 45.2°, to Brewarrina, Bourke, Lismore, Walgett, and Moree, where it was 71.2°, 69.0°, 68.5°, 67.7°, and 67.3° respectively. On the coast it varied from 54.9° at Broadwood to 68.5° at Lismore, Sydney being 63.6°, almost the same as Barcelona. On the mountains snow lies in a few places all the winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 58.0°, and on the inland plains about 66.9°.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1906 at Sydney was 32 inches; and the days on which rain fell 161. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day. Fifty years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeasterly sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

**Trade and Industry.**

The great staple produce of N.S.Wales is wool. The export of wool the produce of the State during the past twelve years has been as follows:

Total average amount of deposits in banks of issue for June quarter, 1907:—

| Deposits bearing interest | £23,392,858 |

The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1907, were 4,709,406l., and the working expenses 2,499,741l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being 2,209,665l. There are also 81½ miles of private railway, the capital expenditure on which amounted to 553,389l. There are 129 miles of Government tramways, earning 908,701l., against working expenses amounting to 727,947l. The total capital expenditure on tramways was 3,600,524l.

Of telegraphs there are 15,417 miles open, with 74,754 miles of wire and 1,122 stations. The cost of construction, including telephones, was 1,474,104l., and the revenue received during 1906, 186,962l. from telegraph, and 144,933l. from telephone branch.

The following are the numbers of telegrams transmitted and received in New South Wales during 1906:—

Transmitted.

| Outside New South Wales | 719,280 |
| Inland                  | 2,645,749 |

Of Inland rivers the Murray, Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan are navigable most of the year, and nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, the Macleay, the Manning, the Hunter, the Hawkesbury, and the Shoalhaven, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all
parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Brindisi), the Orient Royal Mail lines (via Suez and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), North German Lloyd (via Genoa), White Star line (via Durban and Capetown), Aberdeen line (via Natal and Capetown), Federal, Houlder, Shire and Bucknall lines (via Suez). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Public Instruction Act of 1880. Teachers in State schools belong to the Public Service and are paid fixed salaries. Fees in State primary and superior public schools were abolished from the 8th October, 1906. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

In 1906 there were 3,101 State schools divided into 5 high schools, 2 for boys, 2 for girls and 1 mixed, public and half-time schools, provisional schools, house-to-house schools, evening public schools, subsidised schools 195, industrial and reformatory schools 3. The State has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective Churches. For the year 1906 the net cost to the State of public instruction was 817,440/.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1850. Its State endowment was originally 5,000/, and from 1890 to 1892 was as high as 13,900/, but it has now been reduced to 10,000/. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations.

The State endowment and special grants for 1906 amounted to 13,500/. Threedenominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of 500/ per annum. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated, having a similar endowment. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and engineering. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 657 pupils, and having a State endowment of 1,500/. There is also a technical college, under the Department of Public Instruction, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns. The fees are within the reach of all, and the college is open to males and females alike. Public libraries and schools of art are established throughout the State. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnaean, a Zoological, a Geographical, and an Art Society, a Government Observatory, Agricultural and Forestry Museum, and a Mining and Geological, also Technological Museums, a Government Agricultural College, Experimental Farms, with many other educational associations.

Defence.

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, and George's Heads, Sydney Harbour, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

Local Government.

Local Government throughout New South Wales is governed by the Local Government Act, 1906, a measure in which are consolidated the Local Government Shires Act, 1905, and the Local Government Extension Act, 1906.

The greater part of the State is incorporated, leaving only the "Western Division," which is but sparsely settled, outside the scope of the Act, though even in that division there are a few towns which, having been incorporated as Municipalities under the Municipalities Act of 1897, now repealed, are governed by the new law.

There are two kinds of Local Government organisation—viz., Shires and Municipalities. Speaking generally, the Municipal form of organisation is applied to towns, the Shire form to the open country outside the towns. There are 134 Shires and 192 Municipalities.

Shires.

The Shires were incorporated on 7th March, 1906, and when rolls of electors had been prepared and arrangements brought to a head, a Council of six members was elected in each Shire. The Shires were divided into three Ridings, and each Riding elected two Councillors. The Councils hold office until 31st January, 1908, and thereafter the elections will be triennial.

The first Shire Council having been elected in November, 1906, a few weeks were allowed for organisation; and the control of all roads, bridges, public watering places for travelling stock, and wharves and jetties, was transferred to the Councils on 1st January, 1907.

The Shire Councils may, under the Act, as time goes on, largely extend their functions, and take up many duties not at present part of their work.

To obtain the revenue they require the Councils levy general rates not less than ld. nor more than 2d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of rateable land (i.e., the value the land would realise in the open market if it had no improvements on it, but with the rest of the surrounding district in its present state of development).

For special purposes Shire Councils may levy "special" or "local" rates, subject to the right of the "ratepayers" to demand a poll, at which the rate may be vetoed. Shire Councils may not borrow.

To assist Shire Councils the Act provides that they shall be classified once every three years, and that not less than 150,000/- shall be distributed as endowment in accordance with the classification.

For the past ten years the Government of New South Wales has levied a direct tax of 1d. in the £ on the Unimproved Capital Value of land, and this tax has been taken into Consolidated Revenue. The Local Government Act provides that when a Shire Council levies a rate on the Unimproved Capital Value of land the Government land tax shall be suspended.

Municipalities.

The Municipalities Act of 1867, and its Amending Acts, which were consolidated in 1897, have been swept away, and the Municipal organisation brought into line with that of the Shires. The new law came into force on 1st January, 1907, the day on which the newly elected Shire Councils took up their task.

All Municipal Councils are to retire on 31st January, 1908, and thereafter elections are to be held once in three years. The old system of the retirement of one-third of the Aldermen each year has disappeared—all go out of office on the
same day—so that the 1st February, 1908, will be a Local Government General Election day throughout the State.

The functions of Municipal Councils under the old law were confined within certain very circumscribed limits, which they had outgrown owing to the rapid progress of the State and the growth of town life. The new Act makes provision for any Council to extend very widely its sphere of activity as necessity occurs, so that it is possible now for a Municipality to undertake the conduct of an infants' milk depot, or a public mortuary, or to regulate the erection of buildings or town-planning in the sub-division of land for building sites, with many other powers.

The financial system is also being completely revolutionised. Under the old Municipalities Act all rates were levied on rental values. During the first year of the operation of the new Act this system was continued. From 1st January, 1908, all Municipal rates will be levied either on the Unimproved or Improved Capital Value. The whole of the General Purposes requirements may be levied by a General Rate (which must not be less than 1d., and may be any higher number of pence in the £) on the Unimproved Capital Value of rateable land. If the Council prefer, they may levy only part of General Purposes requirements as a General Rate on Unimproved Capital Value, and the rest as an Additional General Rate on either the Unimproved Capital Value or Improved Capital Value. Similarly, any special, local or loan rates may be levied on either Unimproved Capital Value or Improved Capital Value as Council may decide. In all these cases, however, except in the case of "General" Rates, the ratepayers may demand a poll, and at the poll may decide whether the rate is to be on the Unimproved or the Improved Capital Value. With respect to special and local rates the poll may also decide whether the rate shall be levied at all.

As to loans, the new Act introduces the principle that wherever a Council proposes to borrow (except to repay an existing loan) they shall first submit the proposal to a poll of ratepayers. If the poll approve of the loan, then before raising it a loan rate must be levied sufficient to pay interest and sinking fund contributions in respect thereof; and this rate must be continued until the loan is wholly repaid.

The new law also provides for the introduction of uniformity into municipal accounts, the Government being empowered to make regulations prescribing the manner in which the accounts are to be kept.

The system of accounts is now being prepared, and will be brought into operation in September, 1908.

In Municipalities, as in Shires, the State Land Tax will disappear on the Council's levying general rates on the Unimproved Capital Value of all rateable land.

Manufactories and Works.

In 1905 there were 3,700 Manufactories and Works, employing 72,175 hands, of which 56,117 were males and 16,058 females.

Constitution.

The first Legislative Council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers on H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 61 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry. All members are privileged to travel free over all Government Railways and Tramways.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880," consisted of 141 members, representing 74 electoral districts; and provision was made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise was given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in district.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l., respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

A new Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provided for the division of the State into 125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The new Act also abolished the property qualification and plural voting, and established the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalised subject, and who shall have resided in the State for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. As the qualification of electors who held Electors' Rights had been tested at Revision Courts, the residence necessary in the new district, on change of residence from one district to another, was reduced from three months to one month, during which period the elector is entitled to vote in the original electorate. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day. The first election under this Act took place on July 17th, 1894; the second on July 24th, 1895; the third on July 27th, 1898; and the fourth on July 3rd, 1901. Under an amending Act, passed in 1896, the franchise has been conferred on members of the police force, who are all in the employment of the State, and not controlled by local bodies.
The Electoral Acts were consolidated in 1902, and during that year the franchise was extended to women.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old Electoral Acts of 1858 and 1880, now repealed.

Early in 1904 the State was divided into 90 electorates, each of which has one member to represent it in the Legislative Assembly. The General Election, held in August, 1904, was the first election held after the new divisions had been made, and at which women exercised the franchise.

The electoral law was amended by the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1906, which abolished the system of elector's rights, and substituted therefor provisions similar to that of the Commonwealth.

The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Under a law passed in 1889, members receive £300 per annum each; in addition, Members also travel free over the Government railways and tramways in the State, and are provided with official stamped envelopes for the transmission of correspondence through the post.

**NORFOLK ISLAND.**

Norfolk Island is the principal of three small islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 58' E long., the other islets being Philip and Nepean Islands. They comprise altogether about 15 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Captain Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there. This was removed in 1853, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 150 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The Pitcairn Islanders were the descendants of the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," who occupied Pitcairn in 1780, and were removed at their own request to Norfolk Island. Of these 40 returned to Pitcairn. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population at the census of 1905 was males 371, females 378. Melanesians, males 166, females 52, total 967. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The island has now been placed under the government of New South Wales. The office of the Administration is at the Chief Secretary's Department, Sydney—Deputy Administrator, W. Houston, C.M.G., J.P., Officer-in-charge, M. V. Murphy. It is a station of the Pacific cable. Communication with the group is maintained once a month by steamer from Sydney. There is a resident doctor. Education is free and there is an efficient school which has recently been placed under the control of the Department of Public Instruction, N.S.W. James Jacobs, B.A., is the head master. The chief village is Kingston, on the largest island.

Chief Magistrate, Captain C. S. Elliot, R.N.; Government Medical Officer, Dr. P. H. Metcalfe, J.P.
Lord Howe Island is a dependency of New South Wales, about six miles long, and one mile broad. Its population at the census of 1901 was males 68, females 52, total 120. It is a mountainous, well-wooded island. The land in some places is very rich, and remarkable for its equable and delightful climate. It is situated about 450 miles N.E. of Sydney, in 31° 32' S. lat. and 159° 4' 26" E. long., and forms part of the State, being administered by a visiting magistrate from Sydney.

The islet of Ball's Pyramid lies about 15 miles south-easterly.

Visiting Magistrate, Frank Farnell, J.P.

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 700 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 670,500 square miles, or 429,120,000 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°; the latter, however, very rarely occurring. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from November to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, to which must be attributed the reduced output of many primary products about that period.

Sugar growing has become a very important industry. In 1906 there were 133,284 acres under cane, of which 98,194 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 1,728,780 tons of cane, which produced 184,377 tons of sugar at 94% net titre.

Maize was grown on 139,806 acres, and returned a yield of 3,703,274 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1906, 666 acres yielded 6,454 cwts. of cured leaf.

In 1906 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 393 acres, which yielded 4,241 tons of tuber, and 758,520 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A small proportion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where
The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony, and about 9,922 acres are artificially watered. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but
but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where
the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. In 1906, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 8,664 acres were mown for hay, and 114,375 acres yielded 1,108,902 bushels of grain, 6,026 acres were cut for green forage.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,105 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 182,384,400 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 24,961,495 acres are leased as grazing farms and homesteads.

The chief exports were: Wool, valued at 3,388,929l.; gold, 2,211,958l.; sugar, 1,615,719l.; live stock, 1,122,138l.; tin, 430,407l.; silver, 85,883l.; meat 664,868l.; meat extract, 10,550l.; hides and skins, 295,425l.; tallow, 181,388l.; green fruit, 120,113l.; copper, 765,702l.; butter, 582,326l.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State, and gives employment to over 25,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mount Morgan mine—Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-eight districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1906 amounted to 544,636 fine ozs. The Herberton district is the head-quarters of the silver, 45,378l., tin, 385,680l., and copper, 389,836l., mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, Hodgkinson, Gladstone, Conlourry, and Mount Perry also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, wolfram (64,136l.), and lead. Copper to the value of 916,546l., and tin 490,283l., were raised during the year. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1906 being of the value of 3,000l., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems to the value of 18,110l. were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burram and Peak Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1906 was 606,772 tons, valued at 173,282l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood dark yellow wood, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay Bean tree pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisa myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1906, 305 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 23,601.

Water Supply.

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1906 an indebtedness to the Government of 801,385l.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 670,500 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 934 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,045 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimerah Run; 564 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 375,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 196° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000l., so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony, and about 9,922 acres are artificially watered. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but
vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51·20 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1901 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions.

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 35 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 257,106. The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1906 were £628,444; their expenditure £644,156; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control £4,548,470, and debt £1,989,185. Debts for water works, amounting to £843,351, which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on the 31st December, 1906, an estimated population of 132,468 (ten-mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (15,506), Ipswich (15,246), Maryborough (12,900), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (19,691), Gympie (14,431), and Toowoomba (14,087), Charters Towers (20,976). All these include an area of five-mile radius. (Census 1901.)

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1906, 11 banks, with 199 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £2,041,831; deposits, £13,924,392. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 90,536; the amount of deposits as £4,292,066.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 30th June, 1907, the railways in Queensland showed 3,137 miles in operation, the cost of construction of opened lines being £23,661,747, the revenue £1,821,946, and the working expenses £912,638. The following lines are now open for traffic:

THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN from Brisbane to Cunnamulla; with its branches (1,598 miles), Ipswich to Dugandan, North Ipswich to Tivoli, Wulkuraka to Kaunangur, Dalby to Bell, Gowrie Junction via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crow's Nest, Wyreema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney, and Warwick to Inglewood. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to The Tweed, connecting with the Southern and Western line by a loop to Corinda, with branches to Beaudesert, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Rockhampton, with branches to New Farm, Enoggera, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Wetheron, Kingaroy, Pialba Cordalba, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

THE CENTRAL RAILWAY is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches (752 miles) to Mount Morgan, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 38 miles of railway are open to Finch Halton, with branches to Eton and Langdon opening up good agricultural land.

THE BOWEN RAILWAY is also open from that port to Bobawaba, a distance of 48 miles.

THE NORTHERN RAILWAY is open from Townsville to Winton, with branches (465 miles) to Ravenswood and Richmond having been carried through Charters Towers, the latter town, a great gold-mining centre, having a population of 20,976 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the sites of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook District a railway is constructed intended ultimately to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 68 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also constructed from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Mareeba, with a branch to Atherton, connecting with the private line to Chillagoe and Mungana, with a branch to Mount Garnet, tapping a large area rich in minerals. There is also a line from Cairns to Harvey's Creek, 31 miles. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, 96 miles, south-easterly.

There is also a steam tramway line from Townsville to Ayr, a distance of 50 miles.

There are 536 electric telegraph stations in the State. The number of miles of line 10,198, with 20,875 miles of wire. The receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department were £381,759.

The number of messages during 1906 was 1,894,923. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 4,405 subscribers who use it, and cables containing multiple wires are now being laid underground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street, and to secure a metallic circuit, and the Revenue amounted to £37,413.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Melbourne every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every three weeks; via Vancouver every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by
Brindisi is thirty-four days. There is daily communication with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1906 there were in operation 1,089 schools with an enrolment of 121,974 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 117 private schools, with 14,117 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,002 pupils on the roll.

A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

Immigration.

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 47,677, and the departures to all countries 47,713, showing an excess of departures of 36. The arrivals of Chinese numbered 347, and of Pacific Islanders 314, whilst the departures of these coloured aliens numbered 682 and 2,438, and their deaths 96 and 128 respectively.

By Act 53 Vict., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The Elections Act Amendment Act of 1905 provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only, a twelve months' continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc. Owners of freeholds and leaseholds of a certain value possessing a residential qualification in another electorate can elect to be registered for the former in lieu of that within which they reside, but no persons can be enrolled for more than one electorate.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 44 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act, No. 10 of 1887, as amended by the Electoral Districts Act of 1892, the State is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.
