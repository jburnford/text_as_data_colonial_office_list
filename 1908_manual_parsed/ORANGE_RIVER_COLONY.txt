ORANGE RIVER COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Orange River Colony lies to the north of the Orange River and Cape Colony, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts. The population in 1904 was 387,315, of whom 142,679 were white. The population in 1907 had probably not increased.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Mosesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the rush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a

* For an account of the events leading up to the war and the war itself, see "Transvaal."
Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

By Letters Patent published on the 24th June, 1902, it was declared that there should be a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and also a Lieutenant-Governor in the Colony, and that there should be an Executive Council, to consist of such persons as should be directed by Royal Instructions, and a Legislative Council, to consist of the Lieutenant-Governor together with such persons, not being less than two at any time, as may be directed by Royal Instructions. The Legislative Council was empowered to establish such ordinances, and to constitute such courts and officers, and to make such provisions and regulations for the proceedings in such courts, and for the administration of justice, as may be necessary for the peace, order, and good government of the Colony; but power of disallowance of ordinances and also power of legislation was reserved to the Crown. The South African Constabulary was declared to be under the direct control of the High Commissioner.

**Constitution.**

Letters Patent providing for the establishment of Responsible Government in the Orange River Colony were issued on June 5th, and promulgated on July 1st, 1907. In their main features the provisions approximate very closely to those of the Transvaal Constitution.

The Legislature consists of two Chambers—namely, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly.

The Legislative Council comprises eleven members, who, in the first instance, are nominated by the Governor. Of these three vacate their seat at the expiration of their third year of office, four at the end of the fifth year, and four at the end of the seventh year. Their places will be filled by persons to be appointed by the Governor in Council, who will hold office for five years from the date of appointment. Appointments to fill casual vacancies are also to be made by the Governor in Council, but such appointments will continue only until the completion of the period for which the retiring member would have held office.

It will, however, be lawful at any time after four years from the date of the first meeting of the Council for the Legislature to pass a law providing for the election of members of the Legislative Council.

Members of the Legislative Council must not be less than thirty years of age, and must have resided in the Colony for three years, and possess the electoral qualification.

The Legislative Assembly consists of thirty-eight members, of which eleven represent urban and twenty-seven rural divisions. Members are returned for single member constituencies.

The existing magisterial districts are generally retained as separate units, being sub-divided where a district is entitled to more than one member, but in one instance two such districts are amalgamated as one constituency.

In case of sub-division the boundaries of the existing Magisterial Wards are, as far as possible, followed. Every white male British subject is entitled to be registered as a voter if he has resided in the Colony for six months, either immediately before the framing of the register or within three years in case of temporary absence during those six months. The qualification for membership of the Assembly is the same as the voters' qualification. There will be an automatic redistribution of seats, on a voters' basis, at the end of every four years. The Legislative Assembly and any elected Legislative Council will be dissolved at the end of five years, or earlier, at the option of the Governor. The Speaker of the Assembly will be elected by members, and will, on election, vacate his seat.

The language of debate in the Legislature will be either English or Dutch, the language of record being English, while copies of votes and proceedings, and of all proposed laws, will be printed in both languages, in accordance with the practice observed in Cape Colony. It is provided that, in the event of disagreement between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the Governor may convene a joint sitting of the members of both Houses, presided over by the Speaker of the Assembly, when the matter at issue shall be decided by an absolute majority of both Houses. Members of the Legislature will receive as payment for their services a fixed sum of £500., and 2½. a day for each day of attendance, up to a maximum of £300. in any one year. The Legislature will have power to alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Letters Patent, but any Bill effecting such repeal or alteration must be reserved.

The following Laws must also be reserved—namely, any Law whereby persons not of European birth or descent are subjected to restrictions or disabilities not imposed on persons of European birth, or providing for the introduction under contract, indenture or license of labourers into the Colony from places outside South Africa. Special provision is made with regard to the system of Lands Settlement established under Crown Colony Government. The Governor is to appoint and control for five years a Lands Settlement Board, consisting of three members, which will be a body corporate, and will exercise and discharge the rights and duties conferred and imposed on the Government of the Colony by any Law or agreement in respect of Lands Settlement property and the persons in occupation thereof. The Lands Settlement property will consist of all lands held by settlers at the date of the Board's appointment under the Lands Settlement Ordinances, and all other fixed property in any town or village purchased by the Government out of funds allocated for the purposes of Lands Settlement, all movable property vested in the Government and used in connection with such lands or other fixed property, and all stock required for Lands Settlement purposes.
All such property, together with all moneys paid to the Government by settlers, and held by it on the day of the Board's appointment for or on account of Lands Settlement, and any balance of money appropriated to the Government by the Inter-Colonial Council for Lands Settlement purposes, or which with the approval of the Secretary of State may subsequently be so appropriated, will be transferred to and vested in the Board during its five years' existence.

The Government of the Colony may at any time prior to the termination of the four years (subject to the consent of the Governor and the approval of the Secretary of State) enter into an agreement with the Board for determining the functions of the Board at an earlier date.

The provisions as to the Inter-Colonial Council and its termination are identical with those contained in the Constitution of the Transvaal.

The election for the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907.

**Railways.**

The railways are worked under the name of the Central South African Railways, and administered by the Inter-Colonial Council of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony.

The railway system in the Colony consists of:

(1) A main line connecting the Cape Colony ports of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London with the Transvaal, running from Mid Norval's Pont Bridge and Mid Bethulie Bridge to Mid Vaal River Bridge, a distance of 334 miles from Mid Norval's Pont Bridge, the line from East London connecting at Springfontein, a distance from Mid Bethulie Bridge of 28 miles.

(2) The following branch lines:—Springfontein to Fauresmith (57 miles); Hamilton Junction to Tempe Cantonments (4 miles); Bloemfontein to Ladybrand (91 miles); Marseilles to Maseru (16 miles); Smaldeel Junction to Winburg (28 miles); Dover to Parys (20 miles); Wolfheuvel to Heilbron (31 miles); Vierfontein to Eastleigh in the Transvaal (10 miles) connecting with the Klerksdorp-Fourteen Streams line, and the Bethlehem-Modderpoort (108 miles), opened in July, 1907, making a total of 723 miles.

To these must be added a line from the Natal border to Kroonstad Junction (178 miles), worked by the Natal Government.

The following line is under construction—Bloemfontein-Kimberley line (101 miles), which, it is hoped, will be open for traffic to the border, about 3 miles from Kimberley, early in 1908.

It is also contemplated to construct a line from Wepener to a point on the Bloemfontein-Modderpoort line (about 60 miles), when all parts of the Colony, with the exception of the Vrede district, will be within fairly easy reach of the railway.

**Climate.**

The Orange River Colony can be separated, roughly, into three divisions—viz., the western, the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile, but requires irrigation.

The middle division, through which the railway runs, holds moisture longer than the western division, and will grow certain crops without irrigation. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock.

The eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe.

The heat, especially in the middle and western divisions, is great during the months of December, January, and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea, often rising on individual days to 105° and 108° Fahr. at 12 noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 76°7' and the mean minimum 45°8'.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein:

| Month | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June |
|-------|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|
|       | 4°04 | 2°93 | 2°87 | 1°88  | 1°01| 0°54 |
| July  | 0°44 | 0°42 | 0°87 | 1°37  | 1°32| 2°33 |

Total for Year ... ... 20°02

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

**Public Works.**

A considerable number of public buildings have been erected from revenue and the small balance remaining from the Loan Fund. The greatest demand under this head has been for new schools and school additions, of which two classes there were no less than 16 separate structures dealt with during the year.

As the above funds were inadequate to meet all demands, large sums were provided from unexpended Treasury balances to enable certain special buildings to be proceeded with. Under this head £33,050 was provided for the new Grey University College, College School, College House, Hostels, etc., the construction of several of which buildings is now well advanced, and £3,000 for new Law Courts, which were commenced in July, 1907.

All bridges provided for out of Loan Fund have now been completed, and two not very large structures are about to be undertaken from other funds.
After the disastrous flood of the 17th January, 1904, it was decided to straighten the course of the Bloemspuit which runs through the town. This has now been completed at an approximate cost of £157,000. The Sanna's Post Waterworks (28,000,000 gallons) have been supplemented by reservoirs at Mazelsoort (220,000,000 gallons) and Mocke's Dam (460,000,000 gallons) at a cost of £245,000; while a sewerage scheme is being carried out at a cost of £96,000. A system of electric tramways is also being considered.

Currency and Banking.

British sterling and the gold of the late South African Republic are legal tender, and accounts are kept in British sterling.

Under the law of the late Orange Free State the National Bank of the Orange River Colony (in which the Government is represented by 70,000£ out of the total share capital of 100,000£), and the Bank of Africa were the only ones that were legally entitled to transact business in the Colony, but banking has since been made free for all banks obtaining the permission of the Government to open branches. The banks at present represented are the National Bank, the Standard Bank, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, the National Bank of South Africa, Natal Bank, and the Netherlands Bank of South Africa.

Notes of all the above banks are in circulation in the Colony.

Industries.

The leading industry of the country is agriculture, inclusive of stock and sheep-farming. The value of the total mining output was, during the year ending 30th June, 1906, £1,222,202. 7s. 0d., as against £957,732. 12s. 10d. for the previous year. The value of the coal mined for the year showed a considerable increase over that of the previous year. There are several coal mines open, of which the Clydesdale, Cornelius, and Viertfontein are the most important. Five diamond mines are actively at work, and yield a value of about £100,000£ a month. Prospecting for both diamonds and gold is being energetically carried on with very encouraging results. The rand formation has also been struck, at a depth of 1,200 feet by a drill near Villiers. Good building stone is obtainable near to Bloemfontein and at other places in the Colony, especially at Ladybrand. Excellent pottery clay has been found near Bloemfontein, and a small factory has been started by some Italian potters with the aid of a small Government grant. Jam factories have been opened in Bloemfontein and Parys.

Land Settlement.

Although the past three or four seasons were bad, the settlers have been enabled to tide them over. The total area of purchased land to June 30th, 1907, amounted to 1,109,081 acres, costing £846,184£. Practically every acre of purchased land, available for allotment to settlers, has been taken up. Up to 30th June, 1907, there were 718 heads of families, of which 640 are British, and 78 Dutch. Land has been reserved for the Imperial South African Association, while arrangements have been made for a limited number of selected reservists from the Royal Garrison Regiment to be placed with certain settlers.

Under the new Constitution all land allotted to settlers on 1st October, 1907, is transferred to a Land Board appointed by the Government, consisting of a chairman and two members, who will administer the revenue and conduct the business previously carried on by the Land Settlement Department for a period of five years from above date. The Board will have power to re-allot any land falling vacant by reason of death or retirement of a settler during that period. All land unallotted on 1st October, 1907, reverts to Responsible Government.

Education.

The educational policy of the Government is administered through the Education Department. From 1900 to 1905 the schools were managed, teachers were selected and appointed, and all expenditure was borne by the Government. Local Education Committees were established in the towns in 1903, but these were merely advisory bodies. In terms of an agreement come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church in March, 1905, the Christian National Schools, which had been started a year previously, were amalgamated with the Government Schools and a new Ordinance introducing certain administrative changes was passed.

Under the provisions of this Ordinance the areas of jurisdiction of School Committees have been enlarged, and the bare majority of the members have been elected by the ratepayers. The powers of these Committees have also been extended in return for the local financial responsibility provided for in the Ordinance.

At the end of June, 1904, the number of pupils attending the Government Schools of the Colony was 12,507. In March, 1907, the attendance had increased to 17,800, or more than double the highest number recorded under the former Government. Education in all schools, with the exception of three Residential High Schools, is free to the standard of Matriculation. The Education Ordinance of 1905 provides for compulsory attendance, subject to certain conditions.

Students are prepared for the B.A. and M.A. Degrees, Law, Surveying and Engineering Examinations at Grey University College in Bloemfontein, new buildings for which are now in the course of erection on an extensive site in the west of the city.

A Normal School in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination held annually in April.

In accordance with an agreement arrived at in June, 1905, between the Government and the leading religious denominations in the Colony, religious instruction of a purely historical character is given in all Government Schools for two hours every week. Facilities are also afforded to the Ministers of the various denominations to give instruction to the children of their own congregations immediately after school hours, for one hour on one day in each week, in cases where the parents make a special request for such instruction.
