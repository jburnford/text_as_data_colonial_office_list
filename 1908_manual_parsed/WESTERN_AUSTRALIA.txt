WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 50' E.

Coast Line.

The Southern and Western coast line is, to a great extent, of a flat and sandy character, with comparatively few natural harbours or other indentations, until the Kimberley Division is reached, where its character changes, and it becomes bold and broken, and fringed with numerous islands. The total length of the coast line, not including minor features, is estimated to be approximately 4,350 miles.

Bays, Gulfs, &c.

The principal inlets, beginning from the north are: Cambridge Gulf, Napier Broome Bay, Vansittart Bay, Admiralty Gulf, Montague Sound York Sound, Brunswick Bay, Camden Sound
Collier Bay, King Sound, Beagle Bay, Roebuck Bay, Lagrange Bay, Port Walcott, Nickol Bay, Exmouth Gulf, Shark Bay, Champion Bay, Cockburn Sound, Koombana Bay, Geographe Bay, Flinders Bay, King George Sound, Bremer Bay, and Esperance Bay. With the exception of Princess Royal Harbour (the inner harbour of King George Sound), the principal anchorages used to the south of the 19th parallel of latitude are open roadsteads, which, as a rule, are only partially protected; but the holding grounds of these are fairly good, and accidents seldom happen to vessels properly found. Fine harbours have, however, been artificially provided at Fremantle, at the mouth of the Swan River, and at Bunbury, in Koombana Bay.

Capes.

The principal capes are: Capes Domett and Dussejour at the entrance of Cambridge Gulf; Cape Londonderry, which is the most northerly point of the State; Cape Talbot, Cape Bougainville, lying between Admiralty Gulf and Vansittart Bay; Cape Voltaire, which is the western boundary of Admiralty Gulf; Cape Torrens, at the entrance to York Sound; Cape Lévêque, the southern boundary of King Sound; Sloping Head, to the west of Nickol Bay, well known to the North-West pearlers; North-West Cape, which forms the western boundary of Exmouth Gulf; Cape Peron, in Shark Bay; Steep Point, situated on the southern entrance to Shark Bay, which is the most westerly point of the Continent; Capes Naturaliste and Leeuwin at the south-western extremity of the Continent, and Point D'Entrecasteaux, West Cape Howe, Peak Head, Hood Point, Cape le Grande, and Cape Arid on the Southern coast.

Tides.

As would naturally be expected with so extensive a coast line, the tides are very varied, little or no rise and fall being experienced on the South and South-Western coasts, whilst from Shark Bay northwards they increase rapidly, though not uniformly in range, attaining at King Sound a height of 46 feet.

Islands.

The islands which occur on the coast are, as a rule, small and unimportant, those best known being Garden and Rottnest Islands off Fremantle; the Houtman Abrolhos, near Champion Bay, on which guano is found; Dirk Hartogs and other islands in Shark Bay, used for pastoral purposes; Dampier's Archipelago and the Lacepedes, on the North-West coast, the latter of which also contain guano deposits; and, in addition to these, there are the numerous but as yet unexplored islands off the Kimberley or extreme northern coast.

Rivers.

The principal rivers are: in the North, the Ord, with its tributaries, the Denham, Bow, Negri, and Panton; the Pentecost, with its tributary, the Chamberlain; the Durack, Drysdale, King Edward, Prince Regent, Charnley, Isdell, and the Fitzroy, with its tributaries the Margaret River and Christmas Creek. In the North-West the De Grey, with its tributaries, the Oakover, Shaw, and Strelley; the Yule, the Fortescue, and the Ashburton, with its tributaries, the Henry and Hardy. Then, falling to the Western Coast, the Gascoyne, with its tributary, the Lyons; the Murchison, with its tributary, the Sanford; the Greenough; the Swan, on which is situated the capital of the State, and which, above tidal waters, is called the Avon; the Murray, the Collie, and the Preston. And lastly, on the Southern Coast, the Blackwood, Warren, Kalgan, and Phillips Rivers.

Mountains.

In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the King Leopold and the Princess May ranges, the highest point in the latter probably attaining above 3,000 feet. In the North-West, between the Fortescue and Ashburton Rivers, the highest range is the Hamersley, with Mount Bruce (3,800 feet). The Darling range, which extends from Yatheroo in the North to Point D'Entrecasteaux in the South, a distance of about 300 miles, attains its highest elevation, 1,700 feet above the level of the sea, at Mount William in the Murray District. In the South, the loftiest range is the Stirling range, the highest point of which is over 3,000 feet.

Lakes.

There are no lakes of any considerable importance in the State. Between the Darling range and the coast there are a few salt water lagoons, and many fresh water lakes, the majority of which are nothing more than swamps during the dry season, and none of them are of any economic importance. The so-called lakes in the interior of the State, which are frequently of very considerable area, are, except after the occasional heavy rains, merely immense salt marshes or clay-pans.

Contour of the Country.

That part of the State lying to the north of the 19th parallel of latitude may be described as mountainous, consisting of alternating high and lower lying plateaux; the highest country here is principally of sandstone formation. The North-West Division and much of the Gascoyne Division is a distinctly mountainous country, the ranges here being principally granite. The north and north-eastern parts of the State contain a large area of good pastoral country. A large proportion of the South-Western and Southern sea-boards is of flat, sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation, and may be described as a vast forest, principally timbered with jarrah, white and red gums, and karri, most of which timbers are of great commercial value. From some points on the Western sea-board settlement has now extended for about 500 miles inland; but, from very complete information furnished by explorers and prospectors, it is apparent that no considerable portion of the interior lying between the 19th and 31st parallels of latitude, and between the 121st and 129th meridians of longitude is suitable for any class of settlement except in connection with the development of the mineral resources. This area may be described as a great tableland, with an altitude of from one to two thousand feet above sea level, the surface of which consists largely of sand dunes, though in many parts of it there are large areas of clayey soils. Between the 30th parallel of latitude and the Great Australian Bight, much of the country is of limestone formation, and here there are immense areas of grass land, which only await the discovery of subterranean water to make them amongst the most productive areas of the State.
History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain James (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, in H.M.S. Success, surveyed the coast from King George Sound to the Swan River, and in May, 1829, Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Chas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. Challenger, took possession of the territory. In June, 1829, Captain Stirling founded the Swan River Settlement, now the Commonwealth State of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success, until, in 1850, the State was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants' petition that it might be made a penal settlement was acceded to. Up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until, on the 30th June, 1886, only forty Imperial prisoners remained. The Imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1890 the constitution, which was what is called "Representative," was established, by Act 33 Vict., No. 13. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council, consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry was sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The Legislature consists of two Houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 30 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 50 members.

Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The State is divided into 10 electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the State for at least 2 years; (3) a natural-born subject of His Majesty or naturalised for 5 years, and a resident in the State during that period.

Qualification of Elector.—"The Constitution Act Amendment Act, 1899," has extended the right to vote equally to both sexes. Every person seeking to be registered as an elector must (1) be at least 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity; (2) be a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty, resident in the State for 6 months; and (3), within the electoral province for which he seeks to be registered: (a) possess a freehold estate of the clear value of £100 above all charges or encumbrances affecting the same; or (b) be a householder, the dwelling-house being of the clear annual value of £25; or (c) be holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of £25; or (d) be holder of a lease or license from the Crown at an annual rental of at least £10; or (e) have his or her name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property in the province of the annual rateable value of £25. When registered he or she shall be entitled to vote for each of any number of candidates not exceeding the number of members to be elected for the province.

Legislative Assembly.—There are 50 electorates for the Legislative Assembly, each represented by one member.

Tenure of Seat.—The members of the Assembly are elected for a period of 3 years.

Qualification of a Member.—Any man who has resided in the State for 12 months, if he be 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity, and is a natural-born subject of the King, or shall have been naturalised for 5 years, and shall have resided in the State for 2 years.

Qualifications of Electors.—Any person of either sex of the age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty, and not subject to any legal incapacity, who shall have resided in the State for at least 6 months, if he (1) is resident in the district at the time of making his claim; or (2) has a freehold estate in the district of the clear value of £50; or (3) is a householder, the house or premises being of the clear annual value of £10; or (4) is the holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of £10; or (5) is the holder of a lease or license from the Crown to depasture, occupy, cultivate or mine Crown lands within the district, at an annual rental of £1; or (6) has his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property within the district, is entitled to be registered as an elector for the Legislative Assembly. After having been registered he or she is entitled to vote for a member for the district. No person can be a registered voter in more than one electorate.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible Ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Premier and Minister for Lands; the Colonial Treasurer and Minister for Agriculture; the Minister for Mines and Railways; the Attorney-General; the Minister for Works; the Colonial Secretary; and a Minister without portfolio.

Western Australia is represented in the Federal Senate of Australia by six members, and in the House of Representatives by five members.

Local Government.

Under the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1906," municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding 1s. 6d. in the £ per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, dues, &c., under the Municipal Corporations Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. Similar provisions with regard to Road Boards exist under the "Roads Act, 1902." Municipalities have power to borrow money for the construction of roads and other purposes, whilst Road Boards possess more restricted borrowing powers for the construction of roads only. Both may levy loan rates not to exceed 1s. 6d. in the £ on all rateable property.

The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Boulder, Broome, Bulong, Broad Arrow, Paddington, Busselton, Carnarvon, Claremont, Collie, Coolgardie, Cossack, Cottesloe, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, East Fremantle, Fremantle, Geraldton, Guildford, Kalgoorlie, Kanowna, Kookynie, Leederville, Leonora,
Malcolm, Mt. Morgans, Mt. Magnet, Menzies, Midland Junction, Nannine, Narrogin, Newcastle, Norseman, Northam, North Fremantle, North Perth, Perth, Queen's Park, Roebourne, South Perth, Subiaco, Southern Cross, Victoria Park, Wagin, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000 consist of a mayor and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and 12 councillors—the mayor being elected annually by the ratepayers, by whom also the councillors are elected for a term of three years. Local road boards and municipal councils have power under Acts of Parliament to issue licenses to carts, carriages, &c., within their respective districts and municipalities. Under the Water Works Act, 1889 (53 Vict., 13), the Perth City Council was authorised to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £, but this power was, under the Metropolitan Water Works Act (60 Vict., No. 19), transferred to the Metropolitan Water Works Board, and since, under the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Act, 1904, to the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage; also, under The Health Act, 1898, the Local Boards of Health of municipalities and other localities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 6d. in the £; 61,000l. was granted during the financial year 1905-6, and 42,000l. during the financial year 1906-7, to District Road Boards (of which there were, on the 31st July, 1907, 102) and Municipal Councils (47) for the construction, repair, and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the State, in addition to the moneys expended by the Public Works Department for the same purpose.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the State at the 30th June, 1907, was estimated to be 264,269, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese at the 1901 census was 1,521, of whom 1,503 were males and only 18 females. In addition to these there were 23 male and 25 female half-caste Chinese.

The chief towns are Perth (53,800, including suburbs), Fremantle (27,900, including suburbs) and the following municipalities:—Coolgardie, (3,830), Kalgoorlie (6,780), Albany (3,435), Bunbury (2,677), Claremont (2,727), Geraldton (2,504), Guildford (1,666), Kanowna (1,212), Menzies (1,046), Northam (2,426), York (1,339), Midland Junction (2,208), Boulder (5,658), Collie (1,713), Kookynie (1,520).

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the State, 12,575,902 acres only were, on the 30th June, 1906, alienated or in process of alienation, while 152,527,740 acres were leased, viz., 151,582,656 for pastoral, and the balance for other purposes. No less than 459,485,158 acres were still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 4,350 miles, not including minor features, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Eucla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the south-west corner of the State are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of Northam, York, Newcastle, Beverley, Katanning, Wagin, and the other centres of the southern part of the State, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total area of land under cultivation on 29th Feb., 1907, was 3,064,035 acres, viz., under crop 460,825 acres, under permanent artificially sown grasses 6,787 acres, new ground cleared during the season and prepared for next season's crops 109,731 acres, land in fallow 118,600 acres, area of other cleared land, previously cropped, now used for grazing or lying idle 222,655 acres, ring-barked or partially cleared land 2,145,437 acres; and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialised in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

One of the principal industries, as in the case of the other Australian States, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 3,340,745) are depastured in all parts of the State. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1906, principally to London, was 15,041,604 lbs., which, at about 9½d. per lb. for greasy and 1s. 4½d. per lb. for washed, is valued at 603,080l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1906 was valued at 708,993l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore, China, and other places to the value of 70,958l. during 1906.

At Shark Bay and on the north-west coast a fleet of 360 schooners, cutters, and luggers are employed on the pearling banks, giving occupation to 179 white, 95 aboriginal, and 2,129 Asiatic pearlers. The export of pearls and shell amounted to 255,182l. in 1906.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but of late years little work has been done in them. Copper, however, has since been found also in several other districts, notably those of Mt. Morgans, Phillips River, and West Pilbara, the exports of copper (ingot and ore) during 1906 being valued at 36,529l.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners to Western
Australia, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

Since the discovery and opening up of the Central and Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, gold-mining has become the principal industry of the State, and so rapidly has the annual output of gold increased of late years, that it has now placed Western Australia at the head of the gold-producing States of Australasia.

There are now 19 goldfields in existence—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Gascoyne, Murchison, East Murchison, Mount Margaret, Peak Hill, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, Broad Arrow, Phillips River, and Donnybrook, and a large population is continually employed in searching for and extracting precious metals.

Much machinery is in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a steady annual output and a settled population. The value of gold produced up to the end of August, 1907, was 75,491,448L. In the first eight months of 1907 the value of the gold production was 4,697,730L., against 5,146,702L. in the corresponding period of 1906.

There is also good coal in the south-west corner of the State, and evidence of its existence in the vicinity of Champion Bay and the Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district. On the Collie Coalfield, situated in the Wellington district, five companies are now successfully working coal-leases. The output in 1906 was 149,755 tons.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered at Greenbushes, on the Blackwood river, resulting in the opening up of a rich tinfield. Considerable quantities of tin have also been recently raised at Marble Bar. The total exports of tin (ingot and ore) during 1906 amounted to 147,380L.

Silver is found, mostly together with other minerals, and extracted in conjunction with gold. The amount exported during 1906 was valued at 37,612L. Other minerals found are ironstone and limestone.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the State: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank of Australia, and the Bank of Australasia.

The deposits in the banks during the year ended 31st December, 1906, averaged 5,550,930L.

A Government Post Office savings bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863; the deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1896, amounted to 520,016L., during the year ended 30th June, 1897, to 1,068,322L., during the year ended 30th June, 1898, to 1,231,638L., during the year ended 30th June, 1899, to 1,057,023L., during the year ended 30th June, 1900, to 1,112,251L., during the year ended 30th June, 1901, to 1,333,376L., during the year ended 30th June, 1902, to 1,534,010L., during the year ended 30th June, 1903, to 1,605,148L., during the year ended 30th June, 1904, to 1,631,687L., during the year ended 30th June, 1905, to 1,703,687L., during the year ended 30th June, 1906, to 1,734,496L., and during the year ended 30th June, 1907, to 1,962,594L.

A branch of the Royal Mint exists in Perth. The quantity of raw gold received at the Perth Mint during 1901 was 860,281 ozs., during 1902, 1,354,615 ozs., during 1903, 1,452,624 ozs., and during 1904, 1,403,084 ozs. During 1905 a total of 1,300,227 ozs. of fine gold was received at the Mint, and during 1906, of 1,232,296 ozs.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the State, and are under the supervision of the Minister controlling the Education Department, assisted by committees of management.

Attendance at school of all children between the ages of six and fourteen is compulsory, and only in special circumstances is exemption granted to children between the ages of 12 and 14. General religious teaching, exclusive of dogmatic or polemic theology, is included in the course of instruction given, whilst half an hour each day is reserved for special religious denominational instruction if desired.

Cadet corps have been organised in connection with several State schools.

Western Australia does not at present possess a University, but aspirants for the B.Sc. degree of the Adelaide University may go through their full course at the Perth Technical School. Local examinations for B.A. and LL.B. degrees of the Adelaide and the London Universities may also be arranged for, as well as for the B.Sc. and B.Sc. (Economics) of the latter institution. The Adelaide University Junior, Senior, and Higher Public Examinations are held at regular intervals, whilst the London and Melbourne Universities hold them whenever occasion arises. Steps have been taken to reserve land for the purpose of endowment of a local University.

The Perth Technical School, which has now been established some years, is in a very flourishing condition, and the scope of its curriculum is correspondingly increasing. Branches of this school are in operation at various centres of the State, whilst in some places Manual Training Evening Classes are held. Besides the Boys' High School, which is subsidised by the State, there are the Christian Brothers' College, the Scotch College, and the Guildford Grammar School, which provide for boys the necessary basis for a university education, whilst for the girls similar institutions exist in the Perth Girls' High School, the Notre Dame Convent, and the Claremont Girls' High School. A Mining School exists at Kalgoorlie. Several bursaries of the value of 10L. each are offered by the Government for competition annually amongst boys and girls attending Government and efficient private primary schools. Three or more secondary school scholarships, of the value of 50L. per annum, tenable for four years, in an approved secondary school, are also offered. In addition to these, five Senior Exhibitions of 25L. and eight Junior of 15L. each are competed for on the results of the Adelaide University Higher Public, Senior, and Junior Examinations, whilst two University Exhibitions of 150L. a year, tenable for three years in any recognised University of the British Empire, are also offered by the Government for competition. One Rhodes Scholarship, of the value of 300L. a year, for a three years' course at Oxford, is annually awarded.

In order that the State may be assured that all children attending private schools are receiving efficient instruction, these schools are regularly inspected to ascertain whether the instruction...
given in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, and geography, is satisfactory.

The amount disbursed for education during the financial year ended June 30th, 1907, was £169,753.

At the end of the year 1906 there were 367 Government schools in the State, with 28,792 scholars on the rolls. The number of private schools at the same date was 108, with 7,515 scholars.

Means of Communication.

The State possesses at present five lines of Government railways:

| Division | Main Line |
|----------|-----------|
| 1. Eastern Railway—Fremantle to Perth and Northam, including Owen's Anchorage, Jandakot and Woodman's Point, Belmont, Upper Darling Range, Newcastle, Greenhills, and Beverley branches, and Mahogany Creek Deviation | 186 |
| 2. Eastern Goldfields Railway—From Northam Eastwards to Southern Cross, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, including Kanowna, Leonora, Laverton, Lakeside Goomalling, and Dowerin branches, and Brown Hill loop line | 605 |
| 3. South Western Railway—From East Perth Junction Southwards, including Canning and Bursley Racecourse branches, Collie, Collie-Boulder, Donnybrook, Busselton and Bridgetown branches | 240 |
| 4. Great Southern Railway—Beverley to Albany, including Darkan, Dumbleyung, Kojonup and Denmark branches | 379 |
| 5. Northern Railway—Geraldton to Nannine, and including Walkaway and Northampton branches | 353 |

Total... ... ... 1,763

Another railway, the "Midland" (277 miles), constructed on the land grant system, affords communication between Midland Junction and Walkaway, and connects the two Government systems of railways.

There are also several other private lines, mostly constructed by timber companies in the south of the State, in extent about 406 miles.

A scheme has for years been under consideration by the Commonwealth Government for the connection, by a proposed Transcontinental Railway (4ft. 8½in. gauge) from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, of the Railway systems of Western and South Australia, a distance of about 1,100 miles.

The receipts of the Government railways for the year ended June, 1907, were £1,357,907, and the working expenses £1,357,907. The total cost of construction has been £10,300,938.

Of electric telegraph at the end of 1906 there were 9,713 miles of wire. The number of telegrams forwarded and received during 1906 was 1,679,172, and the revenue received by the telegraph branch was £69,678; telephone receipts amounted to £36,239, and postal and other revenue of the post and telegraph department to £153,818; cost of post and telegraph, £295,300. There is telegraphic communication with Europe, via South Australia, and by a direct cable from Java to Roebuck Bay, also with South Africa by Cocos Island. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the State, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast. There are also 6,957 miles of telephone wire in the State; further 7,767 miles of Government, and 494 miles of private railway telephone wire.

The steamers of the P. and O., Orient, Messageries Maritimes, and Nord-Deutscher Lloyd Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, Europe, and the other Australasian States, whilst the White Star line conveys those from and to South Africa at regular monthly intervals. Mails are also despatched to and received from Australasian States by the various inter-State steamers. Local steamers supply coastal communication. Letters from England reach Perth in about 28 days via Brindisi. The rates of postage are:

Letters, Newspapers per ½-oz papers.

Within a Town, and between any two places on the Suburban Railway Line from Fremantle to Mindland Junction... 1d. ½d per 10 ozs.

Within the State... 2d. ½d per 10 ozs.

Australasia... 2d. ½d per 10 ozs.

United Kingdom and Dependencies... 2d. 1d. per 4 ozs.

Other Countries of Postal Union... 2½d. 1d. per 4 ozs.

The postal statistics for 1906 give the following as the number (each counted once) of letters and postcards, &c., received and despatched:

| English, Inter-State, and Foreign |
|----------------------------------|
| Letters... 15,436,757            |

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 390 vessels and a tonnage of 19,989 on 31st December, 1906. Harbour works have been constructed, and the Royal Mail steamers, as also those of the Nord-Deutscher Lloyd and the Messageries Maritimes, make Fremantle their port of call.

Defence.

In December, 1906, the Military forces of the State consisted of 6,630 (officers 199, other ranks, 6,431). Of this number 64 belonged to the Permanent Force, and the remainder to the Militia and the various Volunteer corps. King George Sound, on the south coast, is strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian Government and the War Office.

It may not be out of place to mention that Western Australia contributed six companies of mounted infantry for military service in South Africa during the late war; and, in addition, three squadrons of mounted men, one for each of the Commonwealth Contingents.
Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. The natives were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are occasionally employed as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule, they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. In this connection may be mentioned, the successful mission conducted at New Norcia (founded by the late Right Reverend Bishop Salvado), which was commenced in the year 1846. A Bill for the better protection of the aborigines of Western Australia was passed by the Houses of Legislature in 1897, but has since been repealed by the "Aborigines Act" of 1905. In accordance with the clauses of the latter the welfare of the natives is now entrusted to a sub-department of the State under the control of a Minister of the Crown, and provision is made for the appropriation of an annual sum of 10,000£. to be used by this sub-department. In addition to this sum, a further amount of 3,893£. was spent on behalf of the Aborigines during the year ending 30th June, 1907.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate during 1906 was 11·87 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·03 inches (for 31 years), and the mean temperature is 65°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

Papua.

Situation and Area.

Papua (formerly called British New Guinea) is composed of a portion of the island of New Guinea, and of a number of islands, most of which lie to the south-east of New Guinea. The boundaries of the Territory are as follows:—"The S. and S.E. shores of New Guinea, from 141° E. long. eastward as far as East Cape, thence N.W. to 8° S. lat. in the neighbourhood of Mitre Rock, together with the territory lying south of a line from Mitre Rock, proceeding along the said 8° S. parallel to 147° E. long., then in a straight line N.W. to the intersection of 6° S. lat. and 144° E. long., and continuing W.N.W. to the intersection of 5° S. lat. and 141° E. long. together with the Trobriand, Woodlark, d'Entrecasteaux, and Louisiade groups of islands, and all other islands lying between 8° and 12° S. lat. and between 141° and 155° E. long., and not forming part of Queensland; and including all islands and reefs lying in the Gulf of Papua to the north of 8° S. lat."

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if Australia is excluded, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland, between 0° 0' and 12° 0' S. lat., and between 130° 50' and 154° 30' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 234,768 square miles. The islands which lie near Papua, and which form part of the Territory, number, great and small, about two hundred. Of these the principal ones are: Kiriwina (in the Trobriand group of D'Entrecasteaux), Woodlark, Normanby, Goodenough, Fergusson, St. Aignan, Rossel and Sudest.

History.

The island of New Guinea was discovered in 1511 by Antonio de Abrea, and it was touched at by several of the early navigators. The Archipelagos lying to the south-east of New Guinea were discovered by French navigators towards the close of the eighteenth century. The waters that are adjacent to the Archipelagos, and to the south-eastern coasts of New Guinea, have at different periods been partly surveyed and mapped by British ships of war.

The whole island to the west of 141° E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of Tidore. The Dutch have established a post on the south coast of New Guinea, known as Merauké, which is in charge of a Resident. It is a little to the West of the S.W. extreme of the Anglo-Dutch boundary. That portion of the island which lies to the eastward of 141° E. long. and to the north of British New Guinea belongs to the German Empire. A Government has been established and several industries are being started there. The acquisition by the British Crown of the portion of the island not claimed by Holland was long advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement in the French island of New Caledonia, created some alarm in Australia lest a country lying so near to Australia as New Guinea should pass into the hands of a foreign Power. To prevent this from taking place as regards the eastern part of New Guinea, the Government of Queensland annexed it to the Empire on the 4th of April, 1883, but this proceeding was not ratified by the Imperial Government. The Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in Nov. and Dec., 188
passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertook to recommend their respective Legislatures to provide for defraying a part of the cost of a Protectorate if one were established by the Imperial Government. On the Australasian colonies agreeing to guarantee 15,000£. a year to meet the cost, a Protectorate was proclaimed by Commodore Erskine on the 6th November, 1884, over the south-east coast of New Guinea and the adjacent islands.

General Sir Peter Scratchley was appointed Special Commissioner for the Protectorate, and arrived in 1885, but he succumbed, in the Protectorate, to malarial fever in November of the same year. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G., formerly Premier of Queensland. At the Colonial Conference held in 1887, the Colonies of Queensland, N.S. Wales and Victoria undertook to guarantee 15,000£. a year for ten years, for defraying the cost of administering the territory now forming the Possession, on the understanding that Her Majesty's Sovereignty would be proclaimed over it. By the Queensland British New Guinea Act, 1887, that colony undertook to be responsible for the payment of the 15,000£. a year. The territory was annexed to the Crown by the newly appointed Administrator, Dr. (now Sir W.) Macgregor, on 4th Sept., 1888.

The Imperial Government has contributed some 52,000£. towards the founding of the Possession. The local revenue raised in the Possession was formerly paid over to Queensland, for distribution amongst the guaranteeing colonies, in reduction of their contribution of 15,000£. a year, but is now kept and expended by the Government of the Possession.

At the end of 1901 the Government of the Commonwealth agreed to take over the Possession as a territory of the Commonwealth, and brought proposals before the Federal Parliament (which were adopted) for providing towards the expenses of administration a sum not exceeding 20,000£. a year. The provision ran from 1st July, 1901, and was subject to revision at the end of five years. On the 1st Sept., 1906, a Proclamation was issued by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, under the provisions of the Papua Act, 1905, declaring British New Guinea a Territory of the Commonwealth, under the name of "Papua." The above Act provides that a sum of £20,000 shall be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth towards the revenue of the Territory in each financial year, up to and including 30th June, 1906, and thereafter such sums, if any, as the Parliament appropriates for that purpose. In 1906-7, 20,205£. was paid by the Commonwealth towards Administration. The estimate for 1907-8 is 20,000£., with an additional 5,000£. towards development.

Description and Formation.

It extends from east to west upwards of 800 miles, and about 200 from north to south towards either end, but is only about 50 miles deep behind Freshwater Bay, near the middle of the portion of the colony that is situated on the island of New Guinea. The total coast line of the Possession has been computed at 3,664 statute miles, 1,728 on the mainland and 1,936 on the islands. The total superficial area is about 90,540 square miles, of which about 87,786 are on the mainland of New Guinea, and 2,754 made up of many islands.

With the exception of the low coral islands of Kiriwina, Nada, part of Murua, and a few others of small dimensions, the islands are mountainous and principally of schistose formation, the highest, Goodenough, 8,000 feet. The eastern end of the Territory is also mountainous, and as the mountains extend westward they rise and coalesce to form a great central chain, which attains its greatest altitudes in the Owen Stanley range, the highest point of which is Mount Victoria, 13,200 feet, and in Mount Scratchley, the Wharton Range, and Mount Albert Edward, the latter about the same height as Mount Victoria. Further west the main range becomes more broken and lower, while pursuing nearly the same general trend towards the north-west as it had in the more eastern part of the colony. The western end of the Territory is for nearly 300 miles generally low and swampy until a long distance from the coast is reached. The mountains near the east end, on the mainland, are of igneous origin; the great masses of the central part of the main range are all schistose, while in the west sandstone predominates, but there are outcrops of igneous formation, such as Mount Yule, upwards of 10,000 feet high. On the Fly River, near the point of junction of British, Dutch, and German territory, there are limestones with fossil corals, and these are also met with at many other places in the low and swampy regions of the western end of the colony and elsewhere. The whole Territory is remarkably well watered. The great mountains, and by far the larger portion of the lower country, are all covered by forest.

Rivers.

The majority of the principal rivers open into the Gulf of Papua. They have a general direction towards a point near the middle of the Gulf. The two largest are the Fly and the Purari. The Fly spreads out its head branches over a large area in the centre of the island, comprising considerable portions of the three different territories. Its course is about 620 miles from the sea to the British-German boundary. The influence of the tide is felt for six or seven score of miles up the Fly. It is navigable by a steam launch for over 500 miles.

The Purari River is the second in point of size, and seems to start from the southern side of the Bismarck range of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. It is navigable by steam launch for 120 miles. The Bailala and Lakekamu rise in undetermined mountains in the central main range. The Angabunga River has its origin from the western spurs of Mount Albert Edward; the Vanspa from the Owen Stanley Range, the Wharton Chain and the southern slopes of Mount Albert Edward; the Brown from the Owen Stanley Range east of Mount Victoria. On the north-east coast the rivers are all small, except four that open into the sea between Cape Nelson and the British-German boundary. These are, proceeding northwards, the Musa, Kumusi, Mambare, and Gira. Each of them pursues a course from the central main range towards the north-east until it enters the sea. The Gira rises from the eastern spurs of Mount Albert Edward, and is smaller than the other three, all of which are nearly of the same size.

Climate and Natural Resources.

As Papua lies between five and eleven and a half degrees of south latitude, the climate of the lower part of the country is warm. It is outside the range of the hurricanes that pervade the southern part of the Western Pacific. At Port Moresby, the seat of Government, and situated
near the middle of the colony, the average temperature for the year 1905-6 at 9 a.m. was 83°6. The average maximum readings for the same period, 85°5; the average minimum readings, 75°5. The extreme range of temperature was from 89°6 to 71°4 F. at 9 a.m. The hot season is from November to May; the hottest months are January and February; the cold season is from June to October, the coldest month is August. During the hot season winds on the south coast are from the north and west, and are unsteady; during the cold season they are from the southeast, and are much more regular.

At Port Moresby the rainfall for the year 1905-6 was 27.059 inches. It is much greater, but undermined, on the central mountain ranges. On the south coast the climate is rather comfortable than oppressive during the cold season. It is generally agreeable at an altitude of 2,000 feet, a height that can be reached on foot in one day from Port Moresby. At 5,000 to 6,000 feet it becomes distinctly cold at night, the thermometer sometimes reading 55° F.; at 10,000 feet ice is met with in the early morning. Above that the grass is often covered with hoar frost, and the cold is severe.

Malarial fever, of a type that is as a rule comparatively mild, is not rare in the low parts of the country. About the time of the change of seasons inflammatory diseases of the chest frequently occur among natives.

There exists there the obstinate scaly ringworm, common in many parts of the Pacific. A mild form of Yaws, not nearly so severe as it is in the Pacific Islands, is indigenous. Sporadic cases of elephantiasis and leprosy are met with, but these have not affected any European. Lupus and simple ulcers are common, and rheumatism is not unknown. Beriberi is also met with in some districts. There is no scarlet fever, croup or diphtheria. Typhoid fever, smallpox, and Asiatic cholera have not appeared, but unfortunately dysentery has been introduced. Cases of cancer have been seen in the country. Such diseases as tape-worm and guinea-worm are unknown.

The climate is favourable to the cultivation of all tropical products. The cocoanut palm bears well everywhere, and is common anywhere along the coast line, but in the far interior it is not met with. Cotton would be specially suited to the dry climate of the central district. Tobacco, in certain localities, of superior quality, and sugar cane seem to be indigenous or to be long domesticated; there are several native trees and plants that yield good classes of rubber. There are some good varieties of timber, including sandalwood, ebony, and cedar. Tea, cocoa, and coffee thrive well, but are not indigenous; the latter has been introduced and propagated. The climate is very congenial to rice and maize and all kinds of tropical fruit. The mineral deposits comprise gold, which exist over a large area; osmiridium, which has been found from the Gira River to the Owen Stanley Range; and in the Purari sandstone district there is coal.

The marine resources comprise pearl-shell and pearls, trepang, sponges, and turtle shell.

**Fauna and Flora.**

There are no dangerous wild beasts in the Territory; wild swine are common. There are several varieties of wallaby, phalanger, and echidna. There are no deer, hares, or rabbits. The most dangerous creature is the crocodile; many lives are lost each year through these amphibians and by snake-bite. The snakes are nearly related to those of Australia. The birds include the cassowary, many birds of paradise, a great variety of pigeons, the hornbill, the black and the white cockatoo, geese, many species of ducks, quails, and on the mountain tops snipe and woodcock.

The flora is as varied as the climate. On the tops of the highest mountain chains there are many species of grasses: several kinds of buttercup, forget-me-nots, daisies, rhododendrons, heaths, and other flowers of temperate climates. The forest there is principally cypress. From seven to ten thousand feet it is chiefly myrtaceous, often covered by trailing bamboo or mixed with pandanus. From two to five thousand feet the evergreen oaks are common. On the low lands there are several varieties of hardwood trees, azelic bijuga, calophyllum, &c. Native cloth is made by beating out the bark of the paper mulberry, of the bread fruit tree, or of certain trees of the nettle family. Fibre is obtained from the banana, the cocoanut, from the bark of many saplings, and the best of all from the aerial roots of certain species of pandanus. Most of the trees and flowers that are met with in the tropical islands of the Pacific, or in North Queensland, occur also in Papua.

**The People.**

All the native tribes of the Territory that have up to now been met with seem to belong to the same race; they present, however, well-marked differences in physical appearance, disposition, language and customs, but not greater than the circumstances would lead one to expect. No clear trace of an older or earlier race than the existing one has been discovered. The present inhabitants doubtless arrived in the country when it was already covered by dense forest; this must have had its effect in separating the people into secluded, shy, and suspicious communities. To this is due the notable diversities so common between the communities of even adjacent districts, each being confined strictly to its own small territory, subject to circumscribed local influences. Thus, for example, the tribes on the Fly and other estuaries have, for generations, had only brackish water; others water running over calcareous formation, or over slate, lava, granite, &c., a circumstance that would perhaps differentiate quite as much as the great variety of food. Some tribes live almost exclusively on sago, others on yams and taro, some on bananas, others principally on sweet potatoes. Many tribes live continuously in a heavy, moist, warm atmosphere near the coast line; others in the light and bracing climate of the mountains at an altitude of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. The average size of a Papuan is less than that of an average European. The race affinities with the Pacific are strong; on the coast line there is a small percentage of a smooth-haired Malay-like element that is absent in the interior. The isolation of the different communities has led to such diversities of dialect that people living only a few miles apart cannot understand each other's speech. There is a well-marked relationship to the languages of Polynesia, and this extends, especially in place names, right across the colony, but it becomes weaker in ordinary language as one proceeds towards the west. The dialects are easy to acquire, containing as they do few or no sounds that cannot be represented by the English
alphabet, or easily pronounced by an English-speaking person. English is now making considerable progress. The European population is 828 and other aliens number some 400 persons; the native population is estimated at about 400,000. There has been, however, no census.

The country and people have no history, and but few current well-defined traditions. These refer to only local movements and actions of tribes within the last four or five generations.

Mode of Government.

Papua had formerly the constitution of a Crown colony, regulated by Royal letters patent of 8th June, 1888, under which the Government was carried on by an Administrator, with the advice and assistance of an executive and a legislative council. The correspondence of the Administrator of British New Guinea with the Secretary of State passed first through the Governor of Queensland, and afterwards through the Governor-General of Australia. By Letters Patent, of 18th March, 1902, provision was made for placing the Possession under the authority of the Commonwealth, and for the revocation of the Letters Patent governing the Constitution as soon as the Commonwealth Parliament had provided by law for the future government. Provision was made by the Papua Act, 1905, proclaimed on the 1st September, 1906, as above stated. There was no form of Government among the native population, the Polynesian system of chiefs being practically unknown; patriarchal authority did not extend beyond near family relatives, and even then was only loose. A certain measure of chiefly influence is being created now by a few men under Government authority, but control over the natives is being best acquired by the gradual creation of a force of village policemen. The Administration has at its disposal an armed constabulary, consisting of about 150 natives, enrolled from many different districts. Special laws have been passed for the protection of the native population, and for dealing with lands. A code consisting of a series of simple regulations, which are from time to time being added to, has also been passed for the benefit of the native population. The general law of the Territory is the same as that of Queensland. The courts of the Possession consist of the Central, Petty Sessions, and Native Magistrates' Courts.

Manufactures and Industries.

There are no European manufactories in the Possession.

The chief industry worked by Europeans is gold mining. The number of miners has varied at different times from 100 to 800 men. Gold to the value of over £5,686l., in 1903-4, £6,362l., in 1904-5, and £8,496l., in 1905-6, was declared at the custom house for export. It was nearly all obtained by alluvial mining. The gold-bearing country is extensive, but it is for various reasons very difficult to prospect. There are also indications of auriferous reefs, and three crushing plants have been established on Woodland Island. Pearls, 1905-6, £2,478l. The pearl-shell fishery is of some importance; pearl-shell was exported in 1904-5 to the value of £1,121l.; 1905-6, £502l. The shell is widely distributed over the eastern seas of the colony, but large areas of water are difficult to work on account of their depth. Beche-de-mer is found on most of the reefs, and will always figure as a small industry, 1904-5, £1,542l.; 1905-6, £3,024l. Sandal-wood to the value of £7,873l. was exported in 1904-5; 1905-6, £2,522l. It is sometimes found in the form of large trees, so far only in the central district on the mainland. It commands a fair price in the market. The rubber industry (1905-6, £1,454l.) is already important, but promises to become greatly more so. The indigenous trees alone yield this article at the present time, but both soil and climate would no doubt be favourable to the better sorts of foreign rubber. The indigenous rubber commands a comparatively high price in the London market. Up to the last few years no systematic efforts had been made to plant coconuts. The old trees are only in small clumps, except in a few instances, and in those exceptional cases the groves are the property of large communities, who make extensive use of the cocoanut as an article of food. Many nuts are now being planted, but the amount available for copra-making (1904-5, 521 tons, 5,671l.; 1905-6, 829 tons, 9,315l.) is not likely to reach a high figure for some time. There are large sago fields in the colony, but this article has not yet been worked for export. There can be no reasonable doubt that the sugar cane, which is indigenous and present in a great many varieties, and cotton, coffee, tea, vanilla, and tobacco, which is domesticated, and of exceptionally fine quality, will eventually be made into great industries. Coffee, 1905-6, £915l. Three coffee plantations and one rubber and sisal hemp plantation have been established.

External Trade.

The customs tariff is comparatively a light one; ad valorem duties do not exceed 10 per cent. The external trade is chiefly with Queensland and New South Wales. There are no direct shipments to or from Great Britain. The external trade, imports and exports, as entered at the customs, amounted in 1904-5 to £143,629l., 1905-6, £160,051l. Two steamers belonging to Messrs. Bleons, Philip & Co. are under contract for the conveyance every five weeks of mails and passengers to and from the Territory. There are also trading schooners from Cooktown and Thursday Island. The coasting and general inter-island trade is carried on by means of four small steamers and some small cutters or luggers, many of which are manned exclusively by Papuans. There are suitable substantial wharves for working cargo at Port Moresby and Samarai, at which places all manner of supplies are obtainable at reasonable prices. No macadamised roads have been constructed. Much of the internal communication will be made by the rivers. Tracks have been cut in many directions, and the natives are becoming accustomed to travel alone or with Europeans over great areas. During the south-east trades travelling by small boat is uncomfortable and difficult west of Yule Island, where there is no barrier reef; but east of that the coast is largely protected. East of Yule Island harbours and good anchorages are numerous. In the interior travelling is done always on foot, but in the central district horses can be used on many tracks.

Political Divisions.

The Territory is divided into seven magisterial divisions, in each of which there is a resident magistrate, who is also invested with the executive authority of dealing in the first instance with any administrative matter that may arise. Besides these there are assistant resident magistrates with
limited judicial powers in certain more populous districts. The Central Court, which possesses the jurisdiction of an ordinary Supreme Court, sits wherever there is occasion. The principal seat of Government is at Port Moresby. This place is centrally situated. It is easy to approach the harbour, and the latter is large, commodious, and sheltered from all winds. The population of Port Moresby consists of about 1,600 natives and some three score of Europeans. It is not well-watered, but is very picturesque, and comparatively healthy. The immediate neighbourhood is not well suited for ordinary cultivation on account of the rather scanty rainfall. Port Moresby is a port of entry.

Samarai, the next place in importance, is an island of some sixty acres two miles from the south-east end of the mainland. There is no native village on that island. It is a port of entry, and the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate of the district. The European population is always greater than at Port Moresby. There is good anchorage there, but no convenient water supply. It is the port from which miners, pearl fishers, &c., generally obtain their supplies. Like Port Moresby, the neighbourhood of Samarai is very picturesque. Its rainfall is nearly three times as great as at the former place.

The third port of entry is the island of Daru, the headquarters of the Resident Magistrate for the Western Division. It has a good and safe harbour, with an approach that presents no difficulty. It is the only harbour Papua possesses in the west, and the island supplies the best building sites obtainable in that part of the country. It is visited by many boats engaged in the pearl-shell fishery of Torres Straits.

Summary.

Papua differs from all other countries in its newness. A large part of the interior is still in the stone age, much of it is in a stage of transition in which the stone axe and the steel tomahawk are used side by side. The aboriginal methods of house-building, of canoe-making, of pottery manufacture, of cultivation, are still generally maintained. About half of the coast line has been brought under missionary influence, and there are two or three stations on the larger rivers.

Four missionary societies are established in the Territory. They are the London Missionary Society, which has for its field the south coast of New Guinea; the Society of the Sacred Heart, which is established at Yule Island, and along the banks of the St. Joseph River; the Methodist Missionary Society of Australasia, which extends its influence over all the archipelagos; and the Church of England Mission, which has as its field the north-east coast of New Guinea, the last-named constituting the Diocese of New Guinea, organised under a Bishop of the Church of England. The two first-named societies were in New Guinea before annexation was proclaimed: the last two have come there since the proclamation of sovereignty. The native population take readily to civilisation in most great matters, while they often cling tenaciously to their own habits and customs in smaller and less important things.

Nearly all Europeans in the Territory give their attention to trading or to gold mining, while very few give much time or labour to agriculture, with the result that cultivation by Europeans has made but very little progress though land has been procurable at a very small price. Europeans can and do work hard at gold mining, but they probably could not do so in the open fields.
