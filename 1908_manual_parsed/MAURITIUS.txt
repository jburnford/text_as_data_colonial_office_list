MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.
Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 49' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 934 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 705 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), having an extreme length of 36 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude. The highest peak, the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, is 2,711 English feet, and Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable beyond a few hundred yards from the sea.
History.

The island was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507, but the first people that occupied it in any great numbers were the Dutch, in 1598, whose commander, Admiral J. C. Van Neck, named it Mauritius, in honour of the then Stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The Dutch, however, though they built a fort at Grand Port, do not appear to have made any permanent settlement, and they finally abandoned the island in 1712. A party of Frenchmen landed there in 1715, and in 1721 it was formally taken possession of by the French, at first on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. The name of the island was then changed by M. Du Fresne, captain in the naval service of France, into that of Isle de France, which it retained till the landing of the English in 1810, when its former name of Mauritius was again restored to it. The most celebrated of the French Governors was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735-1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and of many other valuable plants, and was the real founder of the prosperity of the island.

Mauritius was during the earlier part of the long war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, from the facility with which sorties were made from it by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810; the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The island was visited by a terrible hurricane on the 29th of April, 1892, which caused an enormous destruction of buildings and crops.

On the 23rd of July, 1893, a part of the town of Port Louis was entirely destroyed by fire.

On the 22nd February, 1894, during a small cyclone, a railway train was blown down in a ravine at Pailles Bridge; five persons were killed and great loss of material sustained.

An outbreak of Surra, in 1902, caused great loss of draught animals, and mechanical means of transport had to be resorted to for the sugar plantations. A number of automobiles were introduced, and a loan was raised to enable the planters to lay down tramways, and take other steps to provide transport.

General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture. The natives are proud of their country, and of the designation of Creoles.

Ten daily newspapers and five other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island, English being used in the courts of justice. Debates in the Council of Government may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of 52,740 souls (census 1901). The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal corporation, and raised in 1906 a revenue of Rs. 537,366, against an expenditure of Rs. 510,633. Its debts amount to 136,618L and Rs. 177,740.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals, the Royal College, the Town Hall, the theatre, the public offices, &c.

After Port Louis, the largest town is Curepipe, incorporated in 1890 (population 13,296, census of 1901), situated on the uplands in the Plaines Wilhems. Its climate is temperate, and many families reside in the numerous villas there during the summer season, while they spend the winter months in Port Louis.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg (population 4,810, census of 1901), so called in honour of M. Mahe de Labourdonnais.

Indian Population.

At the Census of 1901 the population of Mauritius (exclusive of the Dependencies, but including Military and Shipping) was found to consist of:

| Persons of European, African, or mixed descent | ... | ... | ... | 108,847 |
| Indo-Mauritians, i.e., persons of Indian descent, born in Mauritius | ... | ... | ... | 198,958 |
| Other Indians | ... | ... | ... | 62,022 |
| Chinese | ... | ... | ... | 3,509 |

Total | ... | ... | ... | 373,336

The total number of Indians was thus 260,980, or 69.9 per cent. of the total population.

The Indian population dates from the emancipation of the slaves in 1834-9. The freed slaves, who numbered about 66,000, were in many cases unwilling to work on their late masters' estates, and recourse was had by the estate owners to Indian immigration. This immigration of labourers from India started in 1834, and except for occasional temporary stoppages, has gone on ever since. The descendants of these immigrants—the Indo-Mauritians—now form the largest section of the population; they are steadily increasing in numbers. They are predominant in the domestic, commercial, and still more in the agricultural callings, and the amount of land held by them as small planters is rapidly growing.

Constitution.

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of five officials and two elected members, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected on a moderate franchise—two for the town of Port Louis, and one for each of the eight rural districts. At least one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any public office. Members are not paid; they may speak either in French or English. The number of registered electors on 31st December, 1906, was 6,632; the franchise qualification is ownership of immovables.
worth Rs. 300, or movables worth Rs. 3,000, or payment of rent of Rs. 25 monthly, or of license duty of Rs. 200 annually, or receipt of salary of Rs. 50 monthly. The session usually lasts from April to December.

The law is based on the Code Napoleon, and other French laws modified by Colonial Ordinances.

Climate, &c.

From December to April is the hottest season in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature on the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The climate at Curepipe, from 1,700 to 1,900 feet above the sea, resembles that of the South of France or Italy. The hurricane season extends from December to the end* of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude.

Water Supply.

A reservoir on the Grande Riviere for the supply of Port Louis Town was constructed some years ago by the Municipality. The works begun by the Government in 1885 for supplying pure water from the upland springs to the chief centres of population are complete. The mains extend from the Mare aux Vacoas—with branches—the whole covering a surface of 60 square miles. The reservoirs and canals so constructed can supply four millions of gallons per day. These waterworks cost Rs. 430,000. The fever has decreased in the localities now supplied with this upland water. Further works of an important character were commenced during 1892, and are being continued, for the purification of the Mare aux Vacoas water by filtration, and for its extension to the town of Curepipe. The filtration is very difficult in times of drought owing to the peaty nature of the water. The estimated cost, including purchase of lands, is Rs. 1,200,000 in round figures.

Scenery.

The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the 18th century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

Railways.

There are seven lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government, viz.: (1) The North line, from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River South-east. Its length is 31 miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Montagne Longue branch from Terre Rouge station on the North Line to the village of Montagne Longue; its length is 3½ miles. (3) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahébourg on the other side; its length is 36 miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet at Curepipe; the gradient in many places is 1 in 27. (4) The Moka-Flacq line from the Rose Hill station on the Midland line to Riviere Seche station on the North line; length 27 miles. (5) Savanne branch from Rosebelle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 11 miles. (6) Black River branch, from Richelieu on the Midland line to Tamarin, distance 13 miles. (7) Riviere du Poste to Mexico, length 10 miles. All the above are of standard gauge, 4' 8½". The gauge of the 7th line is 75 centimetres (2' 6"). It starts from Riviere du Poste station on the Savanne branch, and runs to the Kanaka Government Forest (distance 10 miles) including a branch 3 miles long to Nouvelle France. The total number of miles of railway now open is 121½ of standard gauge and 10 of 2' 6" gauge, the total cost up to date being about 771,649L and Rs. 1,763,688. The receipts in 1906 were Rs. 2,523,712 (including traffic done for other Government departments), and expenditure, Rs. 2,047,895, not including the charge on account of Railway Loans.

Religion.

The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the census of 1901, the Roman Catholics numbered 117,102, and the Protestants 6,644. The Roman Catholics received in 1905-06 Government aid amounting to Rs. 111,520, and the Protestants Rs. 41,121.

Education.

The system of education has been remodelled by Ordinance No. 33 of 1899 (brought into force on 21st August, 1900), and all former enactments on the subject have been repealed.

Under the Education Ordinance, 1899, a Department of Public Instruction is created and placed under the charge of an officer styled "The Director of Public Instruction."

The department has two branches: (1) the Superior or Secondary Instruction, to which is attached the Government Royal College with its two schools, under the charge of the Rector of the Royal College, as well as the Associated Schools; and (2), the Primary Instruction, consisting of the Government Schools and the Grant-in-Aid Schools, under the more immediate control of the Director, assisted by Inspectors of Schools.

The Education Ordinance, 1899, also provides for the appointment of a Principal and Staff for any Government Institution to be established for Technical, Agricultural, Commercial, and General Education.

In the discharge of his duties the Director is assisted by two Advisory Committees of twelve members each, appointed annually. In respect of Superior and Secondary Education, by the Committee of "Superior Instruction," on which the Associated Schools and the Girls' Schools are represented by one nominee member each. In respect of Primary Education, by the Committee of "Primary Instruction," on which the Roman Catholic grant-in-aid Primary Schools are represented by two nominees and the Protestant...
grant-in-aid Primary Schools by one nominee. The Director of Public Instruction is the chairman of both Committees, and the Governor selects and appoints eight members to each Committee.

The Director is responsible for carrying out all regulations dealing with the education of youth in the colony, but the exercise of the powers conferred upon him by the Ordinance is subject to an appeal to the Governor in Executive Council.

Higher Education.

On the books of the Royal College on the 31st December, 1906, there were 352 pupils; of these 240 attended the Royal College, and 112 the two schools of the Royal College.

Primary Education.

There were in 1906—

| Number. | Pupils. |
|---------|--------|
| Government schools | 67 | 8,919 |
| Grant schools | 88 | 9,807 |

Total | 155 | 18,726

Total Number of Pupils.

The relative numbers are shown by the following percentages:

Pupils who attended Church of England schools 2'88 %

Roman Catholic 66'35 %

Other Christian denominations 84 %

Mohammedan 8'68 %

Hindu and others 21'25 %

The total expenditure on education in 1906 amounted to Rs. 601,692, of which Rs. 390,779 were expended on primary education. There are 258 masters, mistresses, and assistants employed. Of the pupils in the aided schools 68 per cent. are Roman Catholics, 2'68 per cent. belong to the Church of England, and 81 per cent. to other Christian denominations. No assistance is given to Hindu schools, but one assisted Mohammedan school was opened in Plaines Wilhems District during the year 1894.

Military Contribution.

Ordinance No. 33 of 1897 appropriates 5½ per cent. of the annual revenue of Mauritius to the use of the Imperial Government as a military contribution. By Ordinance No. 6 of 1900, a sum of Rs. 35,000 is also paid from the Colonial Treasury to the military authorities in lieu of Customs Rebate.

The total strength of the Garrison on 31st December, 1906, was 1,394 men of all ranks. The total military expenditure for the year amounted to 147,631/. The contribution of the Colony was 32,576/. This includes the sum of 2,333/ paid on allowances in lieu of Customs Rebate.

The total police force on 31st December, 1906, was 733.

Communications.

The mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes leave Marseilles on the 10th and 25th of each month, arriving in Mauritius on the 9th and 19th of the following month respectively. The steamers leave Mauritius on the 14th and 25th of each month, and arrive at Marseilles on the 14th and 25th of the following month respectively. There is a four-weekly service with England, via Cape of Good Hope, by the steamers of the Union-Castle line, length of voyage about six weeks. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Reunion, &c.

The British India Steam Navigation Company provides a direct four-weekly service between Colombo and Mauritius.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication is established along and beyond the railway, the total length of line being 285 miles of telegraph and 29 of telephone; and cable communication through a branch office of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company with Europe, via Seychelles, Zanzibar, and Aden, was opened in November, 1893. The Company receives from the Colony an annual subsidy of 7,000L. Through rate: United Kingdom to Mauritius, 3s. per word; and from Mauritius to United Kingdom, Rs. 1'90. The laying of the Mauritius section of the Cape-Australian cable, via Rodrigues, was completed on May 16, 1902.

There are in Mauritius the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 62 branch post offices in the rural districts, 61 money order offices, 53 telegraph and 7 telephone offices. Port Louis has a telephone system, with 79 subscribers. In the island of Rodrigues there is one post office at Port Mathurin. There is no post office on any other of the Dependencies. The rates of postage are:

| Letters Newspapers |
|-------------------|
| United Kingdom, British Possessions* 6 cents 3 cents |
| Dependencies 6 , , |
| Seychelles 6 , , |
| Other countries of the Postal Union or non-Union Countries 15 , , 3 cents |

Parcels Post Rates.—In addition to the following charges, the ruling rate of exchange on the day of posting of such parcels is also levied in regard to parcels via France.

| Via France. | Via Colombo. |

Commerce.

The island produces hardly anything for its own consumption, but its foreign commerce extends to every quarter of the globe.

The chief exports are sugar, rum, molasses, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, soap, &c. Attention is now being turned to the cultivation of tea.

* See list at end of Introduction.
and cotton with very successful results. Oxen are imported from Madagascar, sheep from South Africa and Australia, frozen meat from Australia, and bread-stuffs from India.

The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware, and manure. There is a small tobacco plantation, but sugar production is the greatest industry. About 95 per cent. of the value of the exports is due to shipments of sugar. In 1906 the weight of sugar exported was 186,389,239 kilos., with an estimated value of Rs. 35,626,266. The value of the rum exported was Rs. 10,647; that of vanilla, Rs. 28,605; that of aloe-fibre, Rs. 709,233; and that of cocoa-nut oil, Rs. 98,876; molasses, Rs. 545,083.

The number of vessels registered at Port Louis is now 58, of a total tonnage of 4,762.

Currency and Banking.

The Mauritius Commercial Bank has establishments in the Colony. The total amount of deposits was Rs. 3,985,932.

The Bank of Mauritius (Limited) was established in October, 1894, with paid up capital of 125,550l., and opened in Mauritius in Dec., 1894. Total deposits up to end of 1906, Rs. 2,353,327.

A Government savings bank was established in 1865. The total deposits during year ended 30th June, 1906, amounted to Rs. 995,494. The sum standing to credit of depositors at end of June, 1906, was Rs. 2,850,234.

All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is the currency of the island. There are about Rs. 10,450,000 (in coin) in circulation. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The circulation on the 31st December, 1906, was Rs. 4,026,250.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Dependencies.

The dependencies of Mauritius comprise a large number of islands scattered over the Indian Ocean.

Rodrigues, the most important, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in executive council. The population (census 1901) is 3,162. A cable communication, through a branch of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company, was opened on 16th May, 1902.

The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good: sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years cultivation has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmi-te and vacoa trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Diego Garcia (population, 489), the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, fifteen miles by six and a half, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end, and from two to five miles in breadth.

Diego Garcia is situated at 7° latitude S. and between 72° and 73° longitude E., on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin. In 1885 it was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius, which was, however, withdrawn in 1888.

Increased Harbour Advantages

AT

PORT NATAL.

IMPROVED facilities for Quick Dispatch are now offered at this Port.

The Inner Harbour is accessible to vessels of Deep Draught by Night as well as by Day.

The Port Equipment includes Three Powerful Tugs, Hydraulic Cranes of a lifting capacity ranging from 30 cwt. to 50 tons, 20-ton Sheers, an extensive system of closed Sheds, furnished with hydraulic cranes and lighted by electricity, together with the usual appliances of an up-to-date Port.

A commodious Customs Railway Bond Shed, erected with special regard to the requirements of the Overberg Trade, is approaching completion.

The attention of Shipowners is directed to the recent addition to the Port Equipment of a Floating Graving Dock with a net lifting power of 8,500 tons, and a Floating Workshop of large dimensions.

Extensive Open Spaces are available on most advantageous terms for the Storage of Timber and Rough Imports. These spaces are constantly being added to by reclamation in connection with the extension of wharfage in pursuance of comprehensive plans of Harbour development.

The length of Wharves and Stone Quayage in present use is Two Miles, while additional sections aggregating an equal length are under construction.

The local mines furnish Coal of Good Quality, and every effort is being made to establish the character of the Port as a Reliable and Cheap Coaling Station. Best Coal is obtainable at 15s. 6d. alongside in Railway trucks.

The 13,000-ton Royal Mail Steamers of the Union-Castle Company's fleet now regularly land and embark their passengers at the Wharf, where the Through Journey to the Transvaal by Corridor Train may be commenced. The time occupied on this, the Shortest and Most Interesting Route to Johannesburg, is 24 hours.

The normal capacity of the Port (exclusive of coal) is 8,000 tons per diem.

Natal.

Situation and Area.
The Colony of Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange River Colony and Basutoland, and on the south by the Cape Colony and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,371 square miles, and has a seaboard of 376 miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of about 32,000, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban, with about 70,000 inhabitants, of whom about 19,000 are natives, about 2,000 mixed and others, and about 16,700 Indians and other Asiatics, and about 32,000 whites.

History.
From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.
In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage endeavoured to colonise it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.
Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Chaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.
Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.
In consequence of the outbreak of war between the Transvaal and Orange Free States on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other,

* There was formerly another British settlement named Natal, a factory of the East India Company on the west coast of Sumatra, founded 1751, and not finally abandoned until the cession of Sumatra to the Dutch in 1824.
† Natal, 17,979 square miles, Province of Zululand, 10,461, New Territory (Utrecht, Vryheid, Paulpietersburg, Ngotshe, Balananggo), 6,931 square miles.
‡ Natal, 166 miles, Province of Zululand, 210 mls.
Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and the Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotshe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 46 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,931 square miles.

Zululand and Amatongaland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Chaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Chaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingaan in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Panda. In the latter years of Panda Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetywayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought: one at Isandhlwana, the other at Invezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlvo on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetywayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Govern-
Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatusi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatusi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus, finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinizulu, a son of Cetywayo, as king; but it was soon checked, and Dinizulu and some of his indunas were removed to St. Helena, while others were imprisoned or fined. Dinizulu and his two uncles Ndabuko and Ishingana were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1898.

In 1890 the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Umbegiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Amatongaland, also called Amaputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongola with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Amatongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the colonial forces, with assistance from detachments from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were issued making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

The Ministry as at present constituted consists of:

- Prime Minister, who is also Minister for Native Affairs,
- Colonial Secretary, who is also Minister of Education,
- Minister of Agriculture, who is also Minister of Defence,
- Minister of Justice and Public Works, and the Minister for Railways and Harbours, who is at present also Treasurer,

all of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of thirteen members, is summoned by the Governor in Council. The members are summoned from the following districts of the Colony:—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umvoti; three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; one from the Province of Zululand; and one from the New Territory; but not more than two members may be chosen from within any one county.
Each member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immoveable property within the Colony of the value of 500l. in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 43 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors, chosen by the electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 17 in the Colony. The number of electors registered in 1906 was 23,795.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election, the qualifications of electors, and to all other matters concerning elections, in force at the time of the passing of the Act, apply to the election of Members to serve in the Legislative Assembly. Under the Act No. 10 of 1898, provision is made for the Parliamentary representation of the Province of Zululand.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Constitution Act (No. 14, 1893), includes 2,900l. for pensions to officers retired on account of the change in the Constitution, and also 8,200l. for the salaries of the Governor and Ministers, 600l. for an Under Secretary for Native Affairs, and 10,000l. for the promotion of the welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more than two miles from the seat of Government receive 1l. per day travelling allowance. The session is usually from April to July or August.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or rents property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony for three years, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to vote.

Local Government.

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht Vryheid, Estcourt and South Barrow. Their total revenue in 1906 was 565,455l., their expenditure 624,649l., and their debt 3,882,848l.

Native Affairs.

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime mala in se. This system of government remains in operation at the present time under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11 of 1865; but at the same time, and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may in certain cases apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently, by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work as well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government, and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for the exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875 a tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903 to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is about 2,400,000 acres. The land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies at different levels. On the coast line it is sub-tropical. On the high lands it is hotter than English summer weather in the summer months; in the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced, and snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer, and the sky is bright throughout the winter months.
Malarial fever has been epidemic in coast districts for the past two years, but few cases have occurred inland.

The death rates of Europeans or whites, including those classed in the Census returns as mixed and others, at Pietermaritzburg and Durban for 1906 were 12°89 and 11°33 per thousand respectively, and for the Colony 10°4.

About 81 per cent. of the inhabitants are Zulu natives, and about 10 per cent. are Indian coolies. At the 31st December, the European population, exclusive of His Majesty’s troops, was estimated to be 94,370. At the census of 1904, the Europeans numbered 97,109, or 8°8 per cent., of whom about 12,500 were Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 4,500 colonists of German descent, of whom the greater portion are settled in the New Hanover and Lower Umzimkulu divisions.

**Means of Communication.**

There is a weekly mail service with England (20 to 22 days), with the Cape and Inland Colonies daily, with Mauritius and East Coast ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.) once or twice a month, with Delagoa Bay six times a month or more frequently, with Australia fortnightly, and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. Steamers pass between Natal and Table Bay every week, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth, and Mossel Bay. There are also two direct lines of steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is about 26 days. Two mail and passenger trains leave daily for Cape Town via Johannesburg, the distance being accomplished in 68 hours.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally. Telephonic communication by means of a trunk line has been established between the principal towns in the Colony, and with Johannesburg.

**NATAL GOVERNMENT RAILWAYS.**

**Railway System as at 31st December, 1906.**

There are 935 miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government, with the exception of the North Coast extension between Verulam and Tugela (50 miles), which was constructed by the Natal-Zululand Railway Company, and is worked by the Government on behalf of the constructors in accordance with working agreement.

The main line extends from the Port of Durban to Pietermaritzburg (the capital of the Colony, 70 miles inland), and thence to Charlestown, on the border of the Transvaal (306 miles distant from the port), where it connects with the line to Johannesburg and Pretoria.

A branch line runs from Thornville Junction (59½ miles from the port) to Richmond (17 miles), and from Pietermaritzburg a branch connects Greytown with the City (64½ miles).

A branch to Harrismith in the Orange River Colony, from the main line at the 1903 mile post, was opened on the 12th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59½ miles, 35¼ of which are in Natal, terminating at Van Reenen. This branch was extended to Bethlehem on the 1st of May, 1905, a distance of 64½ miles from Harrismith, and a further section of 88½ miles to Kroonstad, in the Orange River Colony, which place is also served by the C.S.A.R. main line, was opened for traffic on the 21st June, 1906. The line from Van Reenen to Bethlehem is owned by the C.S.A.R. Administration, and is worked by Natal on its behalf.

A branch line runs from Glencoe Junction (231½ miles from the port) to Vryheid, a distance of 59½ miles. An extension therefrom to Hlobane (17 miles) and to Parijs (37 miles) was being surveyed at the end of the year, in terms of an agreement.

A branch line extends northwards from Durban to Somkele (167½ miles), in the Province of Zululand.

Another branch runs from South Coast Junction to North Shepstone (77½ miles), and places in touch with the town of Durban a portion of the Colony which has large natural resources. This line is now being extended to Beach Terminus, on the south side of the Umzimkulu River, a distance of 5½ miles.

A line runs from the South Coast Branch at Alexandra Junction to Umtinto, 61 miles distant, and serves an important sugar-growing area.

A further branch connecting the main line with the Bluff side (Wests) goes out from Clairmont on the South Coast Line, and is 6½ miles in length.

A branch line runs from Pietermaritzburg (the Natal Trunk Line Junction) to Creighton, a distance of 95 miles. It is then proposed to continue the line to Riverside on the Griqualand East boundary, and when completed will form a new connection with Cape Colony.

Starting from Ennersdale, on the main line, a branch line runs to Los Kop, 131 miles, and is being extended to Winterton, a further distance of 24 miles.

A 2 feet light railway is being built between Estcourt, on the main line, and Weenan, a distance of 28½ miles.

Another 2 feet light railway is being constructed between Esperanza, on the Umtinto branch, to Donnybrook, on the Natal-Cape line, passing through Stuartstown, and when completed will be about 100 miles in length.
The work of railway construction was begun in January, 1876, and the sections then authorised were completed in December, 1880. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 114 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the last, which completed the main line to Charlestown on the border of the Transvaal, was opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was opened on the 1st December, 1895.

The total cost of construction of the railways up to the end of 1906 was £13,692,963l. The receipts for 1906 were £1,836,916l., and the expenditure £1,774,548l. The net receipts were equal to 4l. 8s. 8½d. per cent. upon the capital expended on open lines.

**Defence.**

There was, in 1906, an Imperial garrison quartered at Pietermaritzburg, consisting of one infantry battalion, besides detachments of the usual departmental corps. The total strength of the Imperial Forces in Natal, 1906, was about 900, including details, of all ranks.

The volunteer force of the Colony has been converted into a militia, is partially paid, and is divided into a naval corps of 91 men, about 1,663 mounted riflemen, 3 field batteries of 326, including a pomm-pom section, and 2 infantry battalions of 596 men, besides departmental corps numbering 133, and a staff of 45. The whole force is fully equipped and armed with modern weapons.

The Colony also maintains an armed and mounted police force, numbering 967 Europeans, fully equipped and available for field service. The volunteers and police were on active service for over 12 months during the Boer War (1899-1902). Since the beginning of 1903 volunteering received a great impetus, owing to the passing of the Militia Act; and in September of that year the total number of all ranks was about 2,700. The Militia Act gives the Government power to call out for service, in emergency, all males between the ages of 18 and 60.

Military training is compulsory on all boys over 10 years attending the Government schools. They are organised in cadet corps, and numbered 3,018 at end of 1906. There is also a senior cadet corps, formed during 1904, composed of youths who have left school of from 16 to 20 years of age, and numbering some 453. In addition there were, at the end of 1906, 119 Rifle Associations, with a total strength, excluding Natal police and militiamen, of 5,774.

The Port of Durban is defended by batteries armed with modern heavy guns.

**Industry.**

The chief industries are the production of sugar, tea, wattle bark, wool, maize, potatoes, Kaffir corn and the mining of coal; dairying; fruit culture; and the breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. The chief exports are coal, wool, mohair, wattle bark, tea, sugar, tobacco, maize, fruit and fruit preserves, hides and skins. The chief imports are apparel and cotton goods, haberdashery, woollen manufactures, leather goods, hardware and machinery, wooden manufactures, living animals, corn and grain, agricultural implements and seeds, articles of food and drink including frozen meats, tobacco, and books and stationery. A large and increasing trade, principally with the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies, is carried on, and the bulk of imports goes to those colonies. In 1896 the value of exports was £1,926,035l.; in 1906 their value had increased to £10,405,707l. In 1896 the value of imports was £5,437,862l.; and in 1906 they had increased to £11,131,958l.

The bar which used to exist at the entrance to the Port of Durban has been practically removed, by an extension of the permanent works and by constant dredging, the average depth at low water in 1906 being 31 ft. as against 12 ft. 1 in. in 1895. The largest ships are now able at all times to come in and go out with perfect safety, and discharge their cargoes directly on to the wharves.

Durban is a port of registry, having in 1906, 27 vessels, with a tonnage of 1,667 tons net, including a few of the older vessels belonging to Government.

The land under cultivation amounted in 1906 to 809,235 acres, of which 321,793 acres were cultivated by Europeans, and there is a good scope for dairying and stock-farming. The coal-mining industry continues to increase every year, the output for 1906 being 1,238,713 tons (the value of which at the pit's mouth was £542,296l.), as against 216,106 tons in 1896 (value 108,053l. at the pit's mouth). The amount consumed in the Railway Department in 1906 was 216,368 tons. There is also a considerable and growing trade in bunker and export coal, the coal bunkered in 1906 being 486,892 tons, and exported, 362,118 tons. There were 24 outputting collieries in 1906. The present output is at the rate of considerably over 1,000,000 tons per annum, and this rate will be increased. The freight charge for railway transport is ½d. a ton per mile.

The produce of sugar in 1906 was 23,497 tons (short). A large quantity of sugar-cane is grown for the purpose of feeding stock. The production of maize in 1906 was 3,727,836 bushels (1,242,612 muids); tea, 1,508,455 lbs.; wattle bark, 10,729 tons; potatoes, 440,142 bushels; sweet potatoes, 872,448 bushels; wool, 1,884,615 lbs. The principal stock owned by Europeans were cattle, 243,857; horses, 27,839; sheep, 600,055; goats, 118,202; pigs, 23,377; poultry, 270,596.

The agricultural and mining interests of the Colony are looked after by a staff of experts, under the Minister of Agriculture. These comprise the Director of Experiment Stations, Entomologist, Conservator of Forests, Analyst, principal Veterinary Surgeon, Government Bacteriologist, and Commissioner of Mines. The official journal of the Department of Agriculture is the *Natal Agricultural Journal and Mining Record*, which is issued monthly.

**Currency and Banking.**

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, and the National Bank of South Africa have together thirty-five establishments, with 3,843,568l. deposits in 1906. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1906 (December 31st) a balance to credit of depositors of 509,285l.

**Education.**

In the year ended 30th June, 1906, there were 514 schools under Government inspection—209 European, 17 coloured, 165 native, and 33 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 27,309. There are 45 Government schools, and 469 Government-aided Schools. The management is vested in the Minister of Education, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and
the local control occasionally in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the financial year 1905-06, amounted to 100,296l. 13s. ld., and the revenue to 13,957l. 13s. 6d.
