BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line over 1,000 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, and at that of 1901, 190,000.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and seven in the House of Commons of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and legislative assembly of 42 members on the system of executive administration known as a "responsible government." The assembly is elected for four years, every male adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the province, duly registered, being entitled to vote.

Members receive $800 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

Description.

The population is about 250,000, of whom 29,000 are Indians, 13,000 Chinese, and 4,600 Japanese. The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream (Japan current) striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; the climate is for the most part drier, and the snowfall consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; in 1906 the imports amounted to $15,718,579, and the exports $22,817,578, a remarkable fact considering the number of the population. Exports consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver, copper and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon, halibut, herrings, whale products and oil), lumber, furs, skins, etc. The figures quoted show an increase in the total trade of the province of ten million dollars in two years.

The mineral production of the Province to the end of 1906 amounts in value to $273,643,722, towards which sum coal has contributed $79,334,798.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up; this advance is clearly shown by the increase in the production since 1896, which is as follows: 1896, $4,257,179; 1902, $12,174,242. Total output of metalliferous mines for 1903, $16,964,084; 1904, $18,377,359; 1905, $22,461,325; 1906, $24,980,546. There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.
The chief towns are Victoria (30,000) and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (7,000), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (8,000), Vancouver (45,000), Rossland (6,100), Trail (1,500), Nelson (6,000), Karlo (2,000), Sandon (800), Kamloops (2,000), Ashcroft, Revelstoke, and Golden are thriving places. Esquimalt, V.I., is a coaling station, and is the site of a large dry dock.

**Education.**

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in city school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether first, second or third class) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 13 high schools in the Province, employing 37 teachers. The number of schools in operation in 1904-1905 was 361, under 690 teachers, with an enrollment of 28,552 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

School districts are formed wherever there are 20 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.
This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64½° W. long. Its area is 1,356,120 acres, or 2,133 square miles; it is about 130 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census was 163,258.

Description.
The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,080) and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

Constitution.
Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $160 per annum, and $12 for postage, besides travelling expenses.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

Education.
A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 474 schools, with 20,779 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens. A new consolidated school is opened at Hillsboro' through the benevolence of Sir William McDonald, of Montreal, a native of the island. Another is opened at Tryon by the people themselves.

Finance.
The province has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest. There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a Road Tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

In 1888, election by popular vote was applied to the Assembly, 22 members being returned, representing the Territories included in the Provisional Districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, and Saskatchewan. In September, 1894, these districts were reorganised under a local ordinance and divided into 29 electoral districts, each returning one member to the Legislative Assembly, from among whom an Executive Committee, consisting of 4 members, was chosen to aid and advise the Lieutenant-Governor in connection with certain strictly defined matters relating to the government of the Territories. In 1898 the number of electoral districts was increased to 31, and in 1902 still further increased to 35. The Assembly elected its own Speaker. By an amendment to the Act in 1897 an Executive Council was authorised to assume office on 1st October, 1897, the members thereof being obliged to receive the approval of their constituents. This body advised the Lieutenant-Governor upon all matters appertaining to local administration in the Territories. The Territories have rapidly grown in wealth and importance in recent years, and immigration has been largely on the increase.

A portion of the Territories was organised in 1882 into four provisional districts, viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. The boundaries of these districts were defined as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52°, on the west by longitude 111°, and on the south by latitude 49° (89,535 sq. miles).
Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Manitoba and Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 111° (107,092 sq. miles).

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55 and on the west by British Columbia (106,100 sq. miles).

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 111° and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia (104,500 sq. miles).

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, these four provisional districts were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,560 square miles.

Each of these provinces is now governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, with the assistance of an Executive Council. Each is represented in the Senate of Canada by 4 members, which number may after the next decennial census be increased to 6, and in the Dominion House of Commons there are 10 members for the two Provinces—provision being made for increase hereafter in accordance with population statistics. There is also a local Legislative Assembly, each consisting of 25 members. Further information will be found under the heading of Constitution of the Dominion, above.

The seat of Government of the province of Saskatchewan is at Regina, and of Alberta at Edmonton.

The population of Saskatchewan and Alberta was (1901) 91,279 and 73,022 respectively, which numbers had increased by June, 1906, to 257,763 and 185,412. Since the latter date these figures have, owing to immigration, more particularly from the United States, been greatly augmented.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply also to Saskatchewan and Alberta. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Alberta than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that there are over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.

NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES AND YUKON.

The North-West Territories now consist of the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and other territories not included in any province or within the boundaries of the Yukon district. The Territories are governed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, with a Council of not more than four members, also appointed by the Governor-General, and the Commissioner in Council is empowered to make ordinances for the Territories.

The boundaries of the Yukon district were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61-62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior.
