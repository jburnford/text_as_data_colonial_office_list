SOUTHERN NIGERIA.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria comprise that portion of territory on the West Coast of Africa which is bounded on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the line of the frontier of the French territory of Dahomey, on the north and north-east by the British Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and on the east by the frontier of the German territory of Kamerun. Its area is estimated at 77,260 square miles.

Constitution.

By letters patent dated 28th of February, 1906, the Colony of Southern Nigeria was formed, and was amalgamated with the Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate under one Administration, under the style of the "Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria," with headquarters in Lagos Town.

The Government is administered by a Governor assisted by an Executive and Legislative Council composed of official and unofficial members.

Administration.

For purposes of administration Southern Nigeria is divided into three Provinces, namely: the Western or Lagos Province comprising the former Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate, with Headquarters in Lagos Town; the Central or Niger Province with Headquarters at Warri; and the Eastern or Calabar Province with Headquarters at Calabar; the two latter Provinces comprising what was formerly known as the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Each Province is presided over by a Provincial Commissioner and divided into Districts under the charge of District Commissioners and Assistant District Commissioners.

Foreign Money Order and Parcels Post systems are in operation with the United Kingdom, Northern Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia, and orders are issued for sums up to 40l. at a commission of 4½d. per l.

There is also an Inland Money Order system, and insurance of letters up to a maximum of 120l. can be effected.

British Postal Orders are issued and paid throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

An Inland Government Telegraph system has now been successfully completed, whereby telegraphic communication is rendered possible between the chief centres of the whole Colony and Protectorate, without having recourse to the cable which runs from Lagos to Brass and Bonny in the Eastern Province. In addition to the telegraphic stations along the railway line from Lagos, via Ibadan to Oshogbo, the principal telegraphic stations in the Central and Eastern Provinces are Owo, Ifon, Benin City, Sapele, Warri, Forcados, Asaba, Onitsha, Oguta, Owerri, Aba, Calabar, Ekwanga, and Bonny.

Telegraph rate is 1½d. per word with a minimum charge of 1s. 1,561 miles of line are open, with 2,081 miles of wire. Further extensions of about 100 miles will be added in 1908.

The African Direct Telegraph Company maintains cable communication, which places Lagos Town in touch with all parts of the globe.

Education.

The Headquarters of the Director of Education are in Lagos Town. Each Province has an Education Office under a Provincial Inspector of Schools, and a Board of Education with advisory powers. Education is not compulsory. In the Western Province there are five Government Schools, including the large Government Moslem School in Lagos Town. There are 36 assisted Mission Schools maintained in connection with the Church Missionary Society, the Roman Catholic and Wesleyan Missions, and the Native United African Church. These are distributed among Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Oyo and other places. There are about 6,900 pupils on the school rolls of the various Christian denominations in the Western Province, and the Government grants to Assisted Schools during the year 1907 are estimated at 3,000l. The Mahomedans maintain a few of their own schools, where Arabic is taught. Six Government Schools, in which elementary instruction in English is given, have been established for this section of the population.

The system of education provides for Primary and Intermediate Schools, High Schools, and Technical Schools. These are of two kinds:—Government and Assisted Schools; to the latter are awarded grants-in-aid which are earned by examination. In the Central Province there are 15 boys' schools and four girls' schools under Government management; the most important of these are at Benin City, Sapele, Warri and Onitsha.

Government grants to the schools of various Christian denominations in the Central Province are estimated at 1,250l. for 1907, and the average scholars' attendance in this Province figures at 2,400. In the Eastern Province there are 11 Government Schools, the largest of which is at Bonny. It is residential, and provided with a Technical and Industrial Department, where carpentering, coopering and other crafts are taught.

There is a High School at Calabar under the management of the United Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland, styled the Hope Waddell Training Institute. This school is financed by Government in part and under certain conditions. Government grants to various schools in the Eastern Province are estimated at 1,750l. for 1907, and the average scholars' attendance in this Province figures at 3,400.

The Roman Catholic Mission, besides extending its work on the River Niger, has erected boys' and girls' schools at Calabar, which are eminently successful. In addition to the above a number of

Defence.

The Military Force consists of the Southern Nigeria Regiment of the West African Frontier Force, with an establishment of two battalions and Artillery and Headquarter Staff, the total strength of the Regiment being 63 Officers, 34 British Non-commissioned Officers, and 1,883 rank and file.

A Volunteer Force has been formed in the town of Lagos. It consists at present of a company of Infantry, 70 strong, with a machine gun detachment.

The Civil Police Force maintained numbers 1,084, including 9 European officers.

Climate.

Southern Nigeria may be divided into wet and dry zones comprising, respectively, territory south and north of 6° 15' north latitude with, roughly, a total yearly rainfall, in the one case of above, and in the other, below 76 inches. There are four seasons—the wet, the dry, and two tornado seasons. The wet zone, in this respect, is about a month behind the dry zone. The dry season may be said to begin about November, lasting till March, when the first tornado season occurs, whilst the wet season lasts from about May to July, followed by the second tornado season. During the months of December and January a cold north-east wind, known as the Harmattan, prevails, and is accompanied by fog.

The monthly average temperature at Lagos in 1906 varied from 77°2', the mean temperature for October, to 84°6', the mean temperature for March. The absolute shade minimum temperature registered during the year was 66° in January, the shade maximum 94° in December.

The rainfall in Lagos in 1906 was 74°76 inches, and varies from 30 to 140 in different parts of the country.

The climate of Southern Nigeria is not healthy for Europeans.

Trade.

The principle articles of export continue to be palm oil and palm kernels, cocoa, rubber, lumber, ivory, ebony, and ground nuts. An increasing amount of cotton is also being exported.

WESTERN OR LAGOS PROVINCE

Is situated on the Bight of Benin, and consists of the coast line from the boundary of Dahomey on the west, to the boundary line of the Central Province, one mile south-east of the village of Omoloma, on the confines of the Shekiri Country, on the Mahin Beach on the east, and includes Badagry, Lagos Island, upon which is situated Lagos Town (capital of the Colony and Protectorate), Ebute Metta, Iddo Island, Ikorodu, Ejirin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and Ode.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (ceded August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi on the Ogun River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the interior.
The Protectorate before 1900 comprised the kingdoms of Pokra, Okeodan, Ilaro, Addo, and Igbesa, with the Awori country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Itchu, Ayesan, and Ibu, up to the town of Ogbo on the east.

By an Order in Council issued at the end of 1899 the Protectorate was extended to the boundaries of Northern and the Protectorate then known as Southern Nigeria.

The boundary with Dahomey is at the coast at 2° 46' 35" E. long., and was delimited in 1896 by an Anglo-French Commission as far as the 9th parallel.

For administrative purpose the Province is divided into Districts, which include the protected territories of Egba Land and Ibadan. They are:—Lagos, including Ebute Metta and Iddo Island, Epe, Ikoro, Shagamu, Badagry, Meko, Idiroko, Oyo, Shaki, Ilesha, Ondo, Abeokuta and Ibadan.

District Commissioners are stationed in each of the foregoing districts, the officer in charge at Ibadan retaining the title of Resident.

Lagos Island has an area of 3½ square miles, whilst that of the province as a whole is estimated at 27,640 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass. At this part of the West Coast a series of low islands runs along the coast, separating the mainland from the sea, and forming numerous lagoons and creeks. Along these lagoons steamers ply, without entering the ocean, as far as Porto Novo on the west and Situko on the Ofus Wena River, on the east. The only opening for many miles to the sea is at Lagos. Vessels drawing more than 10ft.6in. cannot safely get over the bar; passengers are transferred into tenders by means of surf boats, and the vessels proceed with most of their cargoes to Forcados, a distance of 200 miles, and there tranship into tenders.

History.

The King of Lagos (Kosoko), having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown in consideration of a pension of £1,000 a year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further Letters Patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Kotonu, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Kotonu, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

In 1890, Kotonu was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

In 1891 the kingdoms of Igbesa, Addo and Ilaro were included in the protectorate, and in 1894 Jebu Remo was similarly dealt with, Mahin, Itchu, Ibu, and Ayessan being proclaimed protectorates in 1895.

An expedition was sent against the Jehus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

Agreements have been concluded with the Egba native Government, and with the chiefs of the Ibadan, Oyo, and Ife provinces, vesting in His Majesty the King power and jurisdiction therein in all murder and manslaughter cases, and in all cases in which one or both of the parties is not a subject thereof respectively.

Industry.

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, brickmaking, pottery, bead work, ivory carving, and the working of iron.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the island waters, the fish being dried and sent up into the interior.

Cotton planting has been commenced under the auspices of the Government, and the prospects are encouraging.

The British Cotton Growing Association have now, by arrangement with the Colonial Office, taken over the management of the industry, and very considerable tracts of land at Ilugui, near Ibadan, and between Aro and Abeokuta, have been drained, cleaned and planted.

An export trade in corn (maize) has recently sprung up, and is steadily growing.

A small sugar mill has also been erected at Agbowa, in the Colony, and there seems a possibility that the sugar-cane may be extensively grown in the near future.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, and mahogany. The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France.

Chief Towns.

Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, has now about 50,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the West African coast. Within the Colony Epe may be considered as next in order, with a population of about 16,000. In the interior
Abeokuta and Ibadan are believed to contain respectively about 150,000 and 200,000 inhabitants.

The estimated European population in Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, is just over 400, and comprises officials, merchants, missionaries, and a few European ladies. The total European population of the Western Province is roughly estimated at 541.

Currency and Banking.

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with gold dust and nuggets, and some Spanish, American, and French gold coins; but by Ordinance 7 of 1894 gold dust and nuggets were demonetised. Cowries (1,000 = 3d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders.

A Government savings bank was established on the 1st of January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on the 31st December, 1906, held deposits amounting to £28,015/. 10s. 7d. for 2,414 depositors.

Specie amounting to £300,951/., was imported during 1906. Of this, £212,151/., was imported by mercantile firms, the balance of £88,800/., being required by the Government of Northern Nigeria.

A large proportion of the specie imported for Northern Nigeria filters into the hands of the firms trading on the Niger, and eventually into Southern Nigeria.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged into a company named the Bank of British West Africa, and has now also established a branch at Calabar. There is, further, a banking establishment known as the Bank of Nigeria, Limited, which has branches at Burutu and Calabar, with its central office at Lagos.

Means of Communication.

In March, 1901, the present Government Railway was opened and extended from Iddo Island, which lies between Lagos Island and the mainland, to Ibadan, a distance of 123½ miles.

Recent construction, however, has added yet another 62 miles of open line which now reaches Oshogbo, from which point further construction is rapidly progressing, and will extend the line to Illorin, in Northern Nigeria territory, in April, 1908, a distance of 246 miles from Lagos. Railhead is expected to reach Jebba, on the Niger, in December, 1908.

From Jebba, the line is being pushed on as quickly as possible to a point about 25 miles beyond Zungeru (about 145 from Jebba), where a junction will take place with the Pioneer Line being constructed by the Northern Nigeria Government, from Baro (on the Niger 130 miles below Jebba) to Zaria and Kano, large commercial centres, in the north of Northern Nigeria. The funds for both these lines are being found by Southern Nigeria; the assistance received by that Administration is limited to a reduction in the annual grant of 70,000/., hitherto exacted from Southern Nigeria towards the cost of administering the Northern Territory, equivalent to the interest charge on an expenditure of 2,000,000/., on the sections north of Illorin. The total expenditure will considerably exceed this amount, being estimated at over 2,532,600/., (Baro-Kano, 1,230,000/.; Illorin-Zungeru, 1,202,600/.; Zungeru to junction, say 100,000/.). The Niger is to be crossed at Jebba by a train ferry boat, the construction of the bridge, estimated cost 90,000/., being deferred for the present.

The railway terminus is on Iddo Island, where a fine station has been erected, and which is connected by road bridges with the main-land and with Lagos Island.

These are:—the Carter Bridge, which extends from Lagos to Iddo Island and is 2,500 feet long, carried on steel screw piles some 100 feet long; and the Denton Railway Road Bridge, connecting Iddo Island with the main-land and 900 feet long. A steam tramway connects Lagos Town with Iddo railway station.

During the year 1907 a Government road motor transport service of three Lacre cars was inaugurated between Oyo and Ibadan, a distance of 35 miles, and further road extension is in progress and in contemplation to develop motor traffic. This pioneer service has proved very popular, and has already decreased the cost of transport by at least 50 per cent. These motor services are expected to act as feeders of traffic to the railway, and will be replaced by branch railway lines as soon as the traffic developed on any road warrants the large capital expenditure required for constructing a railway line.

A branch line of about 2 miles in length connects the town of Abeokuta with the main line at Aro Junction, 60 miles distant from Lagos.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. A weekly mail service is maintained between Liverpool and Lagos, the time occupied on the outward voyage being about 16 days.

Steamers of the German Woermann Linie also maintain direct communication between Southampton and Lagos at intervals of one month. There is also a regular weekly mail service between Lagos and Northern Nigeria.

There is a system of telephones between the various Government Offices and the principal commercial houses in Lagos Town.

EASTERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Eastern and Central Provinces are bounded on the North-west by the Western or Lagos Province, as described above, on the North by the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, and on the North-east by the German territories of the Kameruns, whilst on the South and South-west they are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

The boundary between the Lagos Province and the Central or Niger Province starts from a point on the sea beach of the Bight of Benin in latitude 5° 52' 20" and longitude 4° 57' 18" about a mile S.E. of the village of Omoloma. The boundary follows a straight line to the junction of the Lagos and the Adabassa Creeks, continuing up the middle of the Opofanga, Kokotoro, Jojokobo, Kofuturo (or Siluko) Creeks, thence up the middle of the Ofuso-Wena River to its junction with the Owena River, thence up the middle of the Ofuso River to its junction with its tributary the Akere, thence in a straight line to the junction of the Akure and Usho main road with the Ogbesi River.
From this point the Northern Nigeria boundary follows a line from the villages Usho, Amurin to Emure-Ile, thence to Egpeni and along the Owo road through the village of Orea and Suada to the point where that road crosses the Ogbesere stream. It then follows the course of the Ogbesere stream to its junction with the Owese River and then the course of the Owese River to the point where it crosses the Ipele-Iduani road. From here the boundary runs in a north-easterly direction through Iduani and Yaiya, thence easterly to Idogun and Ogpe, thence southerly through Itwa to Ake and on to Ushoka, from which village it proceeds in a south-easterly direction to Shebe and on through Yadu to Aushi; thence through Jattu to Uyere and in an easterly direction through Aiota, Afana, Gufu and Goronu to Fuga. From Fuga the line runs to Yangpode, and thence in an easterly direction to a point about ten miles north-east of Idah on the Niger. The exact boundary north of Idah and affecting the territory immediately east of the Niger is in course of delimitation.

The boundary continues in a straight line slightly north of the 7th parallel of latitude to a point near Ashuku on the Anglo-German frontier as laid down in the Convention of 1893. From this point the boundary runs in a straight line to the rapids on the Cross River and thence to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The area of the Protectorate is estimated at 49,620 square miles.

The numerous rivers, creeks and estuaries in this part of the West African coast have received the name of the "Oil Rivers," from the fact of their producing the bulk of the palm oil, which constitutes the chief export of West Africa. The Niger has formed a huge delta with a coast line of over 200 miles from the mouth of the Benin river to Opobo. The coast district here for a long distance, varying from 20 to 40 miles inland, is a mere network of "creeks" and "Islands." Into this delta several other considerable rivers empty themselves, the chief being on the west, the Benin with its affluents, the Osse, Ologi, Jameson and Ethiope, and on the east the Imo with its affluents the Otaminne and Azumine.

The chief mouths of the Niger are at the Forcados estuary, communicating with Warri, Sapele and Benin, the Nun mouth at Akassa, and at Brass.

The Engenni, New Calabar, and Opobo Rivers enter the sea by the broad estuaries known as the Sombrero, the New Calabar, the Bonny, the Andoni, and the Opobo Rivers, and drain a fertile, undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive.

Further east is the Calabar estuary, mainly formed by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length, which drains, with its affluents the Calabar, Aqua, Akpayfe and the Ndiana Rivers, the high mountain ranges running north-west from the Kamerun mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benue.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Jekri, occupying the lower part of the Benin Country, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Ijos, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Warri and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, where they join the Akuna-kunas, being an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle; and the Efiks and "Kwas" in the Calabar region.

History.

The British Protectorate of the Niger districts (Oil Rivers Protectorate) was announced in the London Gazette of 5th June, 1885. It extended along the West Coast of Africa from a point on the shore of the Bight of Benin about ten miles north-west of the Benin River to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger was included in the territories administered by the Royal Niger Company under their Charter of 10th July, 1886.

By an Order in Council, dated the 13th May, 1893, the Protectorate was extended under the name of the Niger Coast Protectorate, and an administration established under Sir Claude MacDonald, K.C.M.G., K.C.B., as Imperial Commissioner and Consul-General; he was succeeded in this office, in 1896, by Sir R. Moor, K.C.M.G.

On the taking over of the territories of the Royal Niger Company in 1900 the Niger Coast Protectorate was extended so as to include the part lying between Idah on the Niger and the Coast, which had been formerly administered by the Company, and the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was constituted under an Order in Council, dated the 27th December, 1899, the administration being transferred from the Foreign to the Colonial Office.

Law and Justice.

In the Eastern and Central Provinces the Law in force is contained in the Proclamations enacted by the High Commissioner, and Civil and Criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Proclamations (1900, 1902 and 1903), the Criminal Procedure Proclamation (1900), the Commissioners' Proclamations (1900 and 1903), the Police Magistrate Proclamation (1903), and the Native Courts Proclamations (1901 and 1903).

The Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice, holds Assizes at the principal centres. There are District Courts, with limited Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Commissioners, and there is a Police Magistrate's Court with similar jurisdiction at Calabar.

The Supreme Court decides appeals from the inferior Courts in Civil matters, and the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decision of Commissioners in criminal cases. The Chief Justice and Puisne Judge are ex officio, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Courts of Northern Nigeria, while the Chief Justices and Puisne Judges of Northern Nigeria are, ex officio, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Court of Southern Nigeria.

Native Courts have been established throughout the districts. The District Commissioner sits as President of the Court, and in his absence the Assistant District Commissioner. Under the Native Courts Proclamation, 1901, the Courts have, subject to the approval of the High Commissioner, power to make Rules providing for the peace, good order and welfare of the Natives. Native law is administered in all the Courts in so far as it is not incompatible with any Statute and not repugnant to natural justice.
Domestic Slavery.

A system of domestic slavery was, until recently, universally recognised—the father or the mother having the power of sale, according to their position in the "House." The evil was aggravated by that peculiar development of the system known as "pawning," under which a debtor could temporarily liquidate the claims of his creditor by handing over as security either himself or a child or a slave, and by the power which the creditor possessed in turn of handing over the security to his own creditors, the same "pawn" passing through the hands of numberless creditors. By the Slave-dealing Proclamation of 1901 the buying, selling, or pawning of slaves is prohibited under heavy penalties. The system has been effectually abolished in the more settled districts, and is gradually being eradicated from those under less effective control. The Native House Rule Proclamation, 1901, provides for the maintenance of the authority, which is vested in Heads of Houses by Native law and Custom, over members of the House. The law enforces the submission of members to the Head of the House, and upon the latter the performance of those obligations towards the members which native law and custom imposes.

Means of Communication.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. There is a fortnightly service between Liverpool and Forcados, Bonny and Calabar. The steamers leave Liverpool on alternate Saturdays, and call at Monrovia, Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos. On the intervening Saturdays there is a service between Liverpool and Forcados. The time occupied in the voyage from Liverpool to Calabar is 20 days. These Companies also maintain intermediate services from London, Liverpool and Hamburg to Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, Brass, Akassa, Forcados, Warri, and Sapele.

Steamers of the German Woermann Line run from Calabar to Lagos in connection with that Company's Express Service between Lagos and Southampton. On the outward voyage there is no direct communication between Lagos and Calabar. Intermediate services are also maintained by the Woermann Line between Hamburg and the ports of the Protectorate.

The Niger is navigable to the Northern Nigeria Boundary for small ocean-going steamers during the months of June, July, August and September, and at other times for shallow-draught stern-wheel steamers and launches.

A regular system is maintained, for the conveyance of passengers and cargo at fixed rates, up and down the Niger River. The distance from Forcados (port of entry) to Idah, the Southern Nigeria boundary on the Niger, is 307 miles.

The Cross River is navigable up to and beyond the German boundary during the wet season by stern-wheel steamers and launches, but during the dry season mails and Government cargo can only be conveyed by means of canoes. The distance from Calabar to Ossidjing beyond the German boundary is about 242 miles. A system of regular transport for passengers and cargo at fixed rates is maintained during the wet season.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, or Calabar, on the river of the same name, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of the administration, with a population of about 15,000. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river is Bende, a great Ju Ju centre. Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church, presented by one of the native chiefs.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the same name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants. It was formerly the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and famous for its human sacrifices. It was taken in 1897, in the circumstances stated below, and is now a thriving trading centre.

The trading station in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea-breeze, though sand-flies and mosquitoes abound.

In Jan., 1897, a peaceful mission on its way to the King of Benin was massacred in the bush, and a force of native troops and bluejackets had to be sent to punish the Binis. The expedition was completely successful, the king's forces being defeated, and the king himself driven to take refuge in the bush. The king was afterwards captured, and is now in exile at Calabar.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling. A small importation of the Imperial bronze coinage has been made, but at present there appears to be no inclination on the part of the natives to adopt it, the circulation being extremely small.

The native currency of brass rods and manillas is accepted as legal tender in native markets in which they were current previous to the introduction of the Native Currency Proclamation (1902), the rates of exchange being for Brass Rods 4 to 1s., Atorine Manillas 16 to 1s., for Awirawu Manillas 6 to 1s., for Abbie or Prince Manillas, 12 to 1s., and Ama-Ogono or Town Manillas, 24 to 1s., and for Perckule Manillas 4 to 1s. In the Calabar and Cross River districts there are also in circulation copper wires, known as "Citims," the rates of exchange being 20 to 3d. (one brass rod) or 80 to 1s. Cowries are still used as currency in some parts of the Protectorate, but further importation is prohibited, and the abolition of the native currency is being gradually effected. A new Nigerian subsidiary coinage is now being minted, and is expected to be ready for issue before the end of 1907. It consists of a nickel penny and an aluminium tenth of a penny, the latter being the first coin issued of this metal from a British Mint. Southern Nigeria is taking the whole risk of the issue, but the coinage will be current throughout the whole of Nigeria.
