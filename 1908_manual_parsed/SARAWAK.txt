SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no
part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 42,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 500,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1885 another cession was obtained of the Trusun River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, and the transfer was approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in August, 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1905. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born June, 1829; married 1869, Margaret Alice Lily de Windt), is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868.

Heir, Charles Vyner Brooke (Rajah Muda), born 26th September, 1874.

Products.

At Paku, in Upper Sarawak, a considerable number of Chinese are engaged in working gold, and also in the Batang Lupar Residency. Gold exported 1898, value $23,685; 1899, $541,711; 1900, $843,709; 1901, $1,424,170; 1902, $1,368,360, and gold ore, $22,470; 1903, $1,784,600, and gold ore, $26,380; 1904, gold, $1,819,200, gold ore $36,395; 1905, gold $1,839,956, gold ore $42,580. The Borneo Company possesses a monopoly of the mineral rights, other than gold and coal, over most of Sarawak, and at Busoh the Company have extensive antimony works, and have erected at Bau and Bidi large works for the treatment of gold ore by the cyanide process. Coal is mined on a considerable scale at Sadong and Brooketon, the output in 1905 being 42,794 tons, including the quantity used by the local steamers. There is a considerable export of timber mostly from the Rejang River to Hong Kong, valued in 1902 at $188,445, 1903 at $83,664, in 1904 at $63,226, and in 1905 at $82,182. There are successful plantations of coffee on Matang, and pepper grows well throughout the Territory. All these articles figure in the list of exports, which also includes diamonds, quicksilver, gutta-percha, indiarubber, canes, rattans, camphor, bees' wax, birds' nests, sugar, tapioca, gambier, and silver. The value of the principal exports in 1905 was: Gutta and india-rubber, $613,940; *Jelutong gutta*, $481,448; rattans, $156,242; gambier, $153,015; pepper, $2,638,414; sago flour, $579,524; sago pearl, $34; sago raw, $8,905. The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

*Note.—Jelutong gutta* is practically a new product, the sap of a fairly common jungle tree. It is said to be shipped mostly to America, and used in the manufacture of paint.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 32', E. long. 110° 28'), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses an excellent hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 100 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baram Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang.

Communication

is maintained by the Sarawak and Singapore SS. Co. with Kuching and Singapore every week; by a Government vessel with Sadong, Brooketon, and Singapore occasionally; by the "Kaka," 250 tons, and "Adel," 189 tons, coasting, with trips to Singapore four or five times a year; and by the "Alice Lorraine" fortnightly coasting service.

Communication is also kept up with coast stations by Government steam launches.

There are roads only around the capital and thence to the mining district in Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles); internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.
