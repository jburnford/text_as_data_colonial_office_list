DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1885, modified by Order in Council 18th December,
1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,650 square miles.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 87 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 21 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $1,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is now 214; 86 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 18 Nova Scotia, 13 New Brunswick, 10 Manitoba, 7 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 4 Alberta, 6 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $2,500 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $2,500 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, and the franchise is regulated by the several Provincial Legislatures, which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from February to May.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. There is a Legislative Assembly in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan, each consisting of 25 members. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory and the Arctic Islands) is very thinly inhabited, and is administered by the Minister of the Interior at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, according to each decennial census till the population in each province reached 400,000. Each Province also receives an annual allowance for Government, and for interest on the amount by which its debt at the Union fell short of the authorised amount.

In the new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan the annual subsidy for each is (1) $375,000 till the population in each reaches 400,000; then (2) $562,500 till the population is 800,000; then (3) $750,000 till the population reaches 1,200,000; and thereafter $1,125,000. In lieu of public lands, which the Dominion retains, each province receives $83,750 a year for five years.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-
General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Provision was made for the construction of a line of railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, and thence to the Pacific Ocean, under the name of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The first contracts for building were let in August, 1905.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises:

(a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 square miles; (b) villages with a population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute

(d) the county municipality; (e) cities are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 15,000. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councillors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except a portion of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,745,574 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion comprise a little over 1,000,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

| **Total**         | 4,324,810 | 4,833,239 | 5,371,315 |

About 1,650,000 of the people are of French extraction, over one million three hundred thousand of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 94,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 34,000 half breeds. They are under the supervision of Government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. According to the census of 1901 there were 17,299 Chinese in Canada, most of whom are in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

There has been a great increase in the immigration. In 1906-7 the number reached 252,038, an increase of 33 cent. on the previous year.

The imports for home consumption from the United States in 1906 were $175,862,071, and the customs duties amounted to $22,187,103.

The amount of customs duties paid in 1906 on British goods was $12,944,249.

### Manufacturing and Industry

Manufacturing is carried on somewhat extensively. The total capital employed in 1905 in factories having more than five hands was $833,916,155; the number of employees, 383,920; the wages paid $102,175,578 a year, and the annual product $706,446,578. The annual product of all mechanical industries, irrespective of number of hands employed, was $78,135,260, equal to 124.81 per head of the population.

### Industry

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. "Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; 45 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 50,000 "homesteads" were granted in 1906, but hardly more than 3 per cent. of the agricultural land of the north-west has yet been placed under cultivation. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Manufactures have been very considerably developed, the output being, in the year 1901, $106,008, and in 1905 $124,81 per head of the population.

The output of wood pulp for the calendar year 1903 was valued at nearly five and a quarter million dollars. Coal and gold (in British Columbia, the Yukon Territory, and Nova Scotia) and copper are extensively worked. Valuable nickel and silver (in Ontario) and...
phosphate mines exist. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and, besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments. The principal imports are textile manufactures, coal, hardware, tea, sugar, raw cotton, hides, and tobacco.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1896 was as follows:

| Year | Tonnage |
|------|---------|
| 1897 | 22,783,546 |
| 1898 | 19,667,126 |
| 1899 | 21,891,706 |
| 1900 | 21,557,639 |
| 1901 | 25,737,154 |
| 1902 | 21,959,433 |
| 1903 | 23,101,878 |
| 1904 | 23,516,439 |
| 1905 | 29,479,562 |
| 1906 | 26,279,485 |

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is about 90,000.

The arrivals and clearances were, in 1906, a total tonnage of 34,732,172, engaged in outside trade, and 46,324,062 tons engaged in coasting trade.

The number of steamers and sailing vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1906, was 7,512, with a net tonnage of 654,179. Of this number 2,810 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 375,263. The number of seamen employed was over 131,000.

In 1906 the number of light stations, lightships and fog-alarm stations was 888, and lights shown, 1,053; the number of steam whistles, fog horns, bells and guns, 119; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lightships, was 883.

Railways.

The length of steam railways in operation in the Dominion on 30th June, 1906, was 21,353 miles. Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems. The total capital invested amounted to $1,332,498,705 on 30th June, 1906. The total quantity of goods carried in the year 1906 amounted to 57,966,713 tons. The number of passengers was 27,989,782, and the distance travelled by trains was 72,723,182 miles. The total receipts were $125,322,805, and working expenses $87,129,434.

The Dominion Government owns and maintains 1,713 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $88,454,383. The working expenses in 1906 were $7,876,167, and the receipts, $7,901,100.

There are 47 Electric Railways in Canada. These ran 50,618,836 car miles, and carried 237,655,074 passengers, or nearly five passengers per mile run.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and a monthly mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama, which has been subsidised by the Imperial and Dominion Government to the extent of $300,000, has been established. The Canadian Pacific Railway has now 10,239 miles of railway. Another trunk line—the Canadian Northern—starting from Port Arthur, on Lake Superior, is being actively pushed on through Saskatchewan towards Hudson Bay.

Telegraphs.

There are 31,536 miles of telegraph line, and 112,259 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 7,228, including 399 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 5,163,287 messages were sent in 1904 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 3,072, being one to every 1,953 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. The telephone is very generally used. The Select Committee of the House of Commons, in April, 1905, reported that there were 81 telephone companies in Canada. Of these, 46 reported to the Statistical Office. Compilation of the reports showed that the 46 had 94,820 sets of instruments; 214,405 miles of wire, and nearly 291,000,000 connections.

There were, in 1906, 368 electric light companies in Canada, having 16,406 arc lamps and 1,825,815 incandescent lights. Every Province of the Dominion is supplied with the electric light.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 262½ miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts in 1906 were $108,668, and the working expenses, including repairs, $88,23,852. Over one hundred and four million dollars have been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not yet been reimposed.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills., $1.86 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

The Savings Banks, under the charge of the Government, on 30th June, 1906, had $61,911,182 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit $27,399,194. In addition all the 34 chartered...
banks have savings banks branches, but the returns to the Government do not specify the amounts on deposits in these branches.

The following banks are established in Canada, on 30th June, 1906:

**Ontario—(Headquarters).**

The paid-up banking capital has more than doubled since 1870. In June of that year it was $32,050,597, and in June, 1907, it was $96,362,130. The bank note circulation on 30th June, 1907, was $75,510,402. In 1877 they held $69,763,668 of deposits, and, on June 30th, 1907, they held $648,636,195. In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1890 amounted to $15,501,360, and in 1906 to $51,839,532. The Dominion Government by statute must always hold, as security for the redemption of Dominion notes issued and outstanding up to and including thirty million dollars, an amount in gold or in gold and guaranteed securities of Canada equal to not less than 25 per cent. of the amount of such notes, the gold held to be not less than 15 per cent. of the amount. To secure issue of notes in excess of thirty millions it must hold dollar in gold for dollar in notes. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government.

**Post Office.**

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended 30th June, 1906, was 323,644,000, of postcards 33,674,000. The number of offices was 11,141. The revenue for 1906 was $7,708,142, and the expenditure $6,696,377.

There is weekly mail communication with Great Britain, via Quebec in summer, and Halifax in winter, fortnightly with the West Indies and Demerara, and four a week via New York. There is a through daily service by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Pacific coast, a monthly direct steam service with Australia (with the exception of Western Australia), via Vancouver, and once every three weeks via San Francisco, and a tri-weekly steam service with Japan and China, via Vancouver, from April to September inclusive, and once every four weeks during the rest of the year.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers | Cents. |
|---------------------|-------|
| Canada, U.K., India, Newfoundland, and certain other Colonies, U.S. and Mexico* | 2 1 per 4 oz. |
| Elsewhere (5 cents for first oz. and 3 cents for each subsequent oz. or fraction of an oz.) | 1 per 2 oz. |

There is a parcel post to Newfoundland, West Indies, Australia, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan.

**Defence.**

The Canadian Militia, from Confederation to 1904, was under the immediate command of a "General Officer Commanding," who was an officer of His Majesty's Regular Army, but in accordance with the provisions of the Militia Act, 1904, a Militia Council has been organized, modelled after the pattern of the Imperial Army Council, and the office of Inspector-General created. There is no "General Officer Commanding."

In 1905 certain of the Military Districts, into which the Dominion is divided, were grouped together into Commands, and each Command was placed under the control and administration of a senior officer of the Militia, who has been granted extended powers in order to deal, as far as possible, with all subjects which in no way involve a question of policy, and thus relieve the officers at headquarters of matters of routine, etc. A staff has been organized for each Command. Each District not under the immediate command of one of the officers holding a Command, is under the charge of a District Officer commanding.

The strength of the permanent force was in October, 1907, 2,820 of all ranks. In addition to garrisoning the fortresses at Esquimalt (B.C.), Quebec (P.Q.), and Halifax (N.S.), and other cities at which it is stationed, it is called upon to act as instructors for the different units and branches of the active Militia, for which purpose schools of instruction have been established as follows:

- **Cavalry**—At Winnipeg (Man.), Toronto (Ont.), and St. Jean (P.Q.).
- **Artillery, Garrison**—Esquimalt (B.C.), Quebec (P.Q.), and Halifax (N.S.). **Field**—Toronto and Kingston (Ont.).
- **Engineers**—Halifax (N.S.).
- **Infantry**—Esquimalt (B.C.), Winnipeg (Man.), London (Ont.), Toronto (Ont.), Quebec (P.Q.), Fredericton (N.B.), and Halifax (N.S.).

**Musketery**—Ottawa.

---

* From 25th December, 1898, postage on letters was reduced to 1d. (2 cents) per ½ oz. in the case of the U. K., India, and the colonies and countries joining the arrangement, and from 1st October, 1907, the rate has been made 1d. (2 cents) per oz. (See end of Introduction.) The internal postage and postage to the U.S. was reduced to 1d. (2 cents) per oz. from the 1st January, 1899. Postage to Mexico was reduced to 2 cents per oz. from 1st January, 1906. Since 1898 rates are as above for newspapers.
In addition to the above schools there is the Royal Military College of Canada at Kingston (Ont.), with a staff of 15 professors, where one may fit himself for a commission in the Imperial Army, as well as in the Canadian Permanent Force, and where a course of scientific instruction is provided also.

The active Militia (exclusive of the permanent force) consists of, approximately, 51,277 of all ranks, organized as follows:

- **Cavalry**—18 regiments and 10 independent squadrons.
- **Artillery, Field**—10 brigades and 3 independent batteries. **Garrison**—7 regiments and 1 independent company.
- **Engineers**—4 companies and a telegraph section.
- **Corps of Guides.**
- **Infantry**—91 regiments of various strength and 10 independent companies.
- **Signalling Corps.**
- **Canadian Army Service Corps**—12 companies.
- **Army Medical Services**—18 field ambulances.

Under the Militia Act all males (with few exceptions) between the ages of 18 and 60 are liable for service.

All technical equipment, with the exception of the heavy ordnance, is now being manufactured in Canada, and the output of the Dominion Arsenal in shells, ammunition, etc., is increasing annually.

Every facility is being afforded for the formation of rifle clubs and cadet corps; there being 475 of the former and 135 of the latter.

According to the Census of 1901—the comparisons with 1891 being added—Canada had of males of military age:

| Age Range | 1901 | 1891 |
|-----------|------|------|
| 20 years to 24 years | 256,981 | 237,144 |
| 25 " " | 216,334 | 194,531 |
| 30 " " | 188,125 | 163,866 |
| 35 " " | 172,551 | 139,899 |
| 40 " " | 152,036 | 118,354 |
| 20 " " | 986,027 | 854,394 |

Esquimalt, in British Columbia, has become an important coaling station, and is strongly fortified and garrisoned by Canadian troops, the Dominion Government paying the cost.

**Chief Towns.**

The cities and towns in the Dominion having more than 10,000 inhabitants, according to the census of 1901, were as follows: Montreal (267,730); Toronto (208,040); Quebec (68,840); Hamilton (52,634); Ottawa (59,928); Winnipeg (42,340); St. John, N.B.

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-Laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee...
council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated; the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1856 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stats., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in Council, advised by five or more Cabinet Ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 98 members; Quebec, 74 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $6 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $1,000. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

**Industry.**

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. In 1901, Canada ranked first in the shipment of cheese to Great Britain, supplying over one-half of the total imports of the article.

The lumber trade is extensive; and manufactures of hardware and textile fabrics are largely carried on.

**Education.**

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public and separate) and high schools, of which there are 6,361, with 488,255 scholars in 1905. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and four theological colleges are also affiliated, and one university is confederated. There are also four denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics' institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the cure and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation.
and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1904, 6,043 schools, with 337,933 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

The following table gives some information respecting the public, high, and superior schools in Canada, also the amount expended for education:

Besides those mentioned above, in the statistics of the Dominion, the chief towns are, in Ontario, Owen Sound, Galt, Brockville, Berlin, Peterborough and Woodstock; and in Quebec, St. Hyacinthe, St. Cunegonde, Three Rivers and Levis, with from 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants each. The area of the two Provinces, including water, is 612,735 square miles—Ontario 260,862, and Quebec 351,873.* The population according to the last census was—Ontario 2,182,947, and Quebec 1,648,898.

Climate.

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal 42°; the extreme range being from 12° below zero to 91°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 26 inches; at Montreal 27 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is considerable.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 459,574.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1538; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I. in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the last census 40,832. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Digby, Kentville, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney (in Cape Breton), Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney, and this city is developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the year ended 30th September, 1906, is as follows:

| Mineral       | Quantity |
|---------------|----------|
| Gold          | 15,046 ozs. |
| Iron ore      | 648,042 tons. |
| Coal raised   | 5,866,605 |
| Gypsum        | 247,840 |
| Limestone     | 400,584 |
| Barytes       | 3,500 |

There are large deposits of copper and other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. The value of the catch of fish in 1903 was $7,841,602. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and the establishment of a plant for the construction of steel ships is proposed, and will probably be proceeded with in the near future; large bonuses are offered to encourage the establishment of such plant.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 18 Members in the House of Commons.
The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every five years. The Members are paid $500 sessional indemnity.

**Education.**

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1906 there were 2,446 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 100,332 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

"The Technical Education Act," Cap. 1, Acts 1907, provides that the Schools of Instruction for Coal Miners, which have been under the supervision of the Department of Mines, shall be under the supervision of the Director of Technical Education, who is an officer of the Council of Public Instruction. Local technical schools are authorised to be established in all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" is to be established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is to be provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college will be the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,177 square miles, or about 17,393,410 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 1st July, 1901, was 331,120.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 19° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 75 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, from which excellent salt is manufactured, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 66 miles inland, is the capital.
(pop. 7,117), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 40,711). Other towns are Moncton (9,026), Chatham (4,868), Woodstock (2,984), and St. Stephen (2,840).

**Constitution.**

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 13 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 46 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

**Education.**

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were 1,807 schools, with 60,681 scholars in attendance in 1906.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Situation and Area.

Manitoba was created into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vict., c. 3, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-53' N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 73,956 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 62,260, which had grown to 154,442 in 1891, and 365,688 in 1906.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a Provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871, the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence to two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced. "Manitoba No. 1 Hard," because of its superior milling qualities is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle and dairy products. In 1906 there were over 60,000 farmers in the province, who had in crop 4,912,435 acres, consisting as follows:

- Wheat ........................................... 3,141,537 acres.
- Oats .................................................. 1,155,961 "
- Barley .................................................. 474,242 "
- Flax, etc. .................................................. 31,790 "
- Potatoes .................................................. 25,043 "
- Roots ...................................................... 13,001 "

The average yield of wheat per acre for ten years is 18-38 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Free grant lands are still available in several districts into which new railways are being projected. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $8 to $20 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of
about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is over 120,000. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Souris, Virden, and St. Boniface.

Coal of the lignite variety is to be found in the Souris Valley. Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg and other centres of the Province.

**Railway Facilities.**

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.

In the year 1906 there were in the province of Manitoba alone 4,054 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

**Climate.**

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to March), 53 inches.

**Constitution.**

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 10 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 41 members elected by manhood suffrage for 4 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

**Education.**

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, all the previous School Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns, and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1906 there were 1,847 schools in operation, employing 2,365 teachers, of whom 596 were men, and 1,769 women.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical.
