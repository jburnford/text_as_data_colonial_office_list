VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the River Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by South Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian, extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and on the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the State meets the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 140° 58' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in latitude 37° 31' S.; longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the whole western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., and extends from latitude 34° 2' S. to latitude 38° 4' S., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,972,578 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser hills, completely dividing it into two parts, and known as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it flow towards the River Murray, and those to the south of it towards the sea. The eastern part of the range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Ripon from that of Borung, and extends into the County of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The higher peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. The mountainous country is, for the most part, densely wooded to the very summits with fine timber, but the peaks above the winter snow line are quite bare, or only partially covered with dwarfed trees or shrubs. From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 200 miles, the mountains are generally so steep and inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south of them, and they can only be traversed with great labour by the few passes that exist. From Kilmore westward the range rapidly dwindles, so that although presenting in places points of considerable height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Mount Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the Western district, a chain of hills, in parts only of considerable altitude, and offering no serious obstructions to crossing in very many places. That portion of the Murray basin commencing at Wodonga on the east as a point, and extending in the form of a regular triangle to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has almost a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country north and south of the Dividing Range and its spurs is moderately undulating; it is in some parts destitute of timber, but closely wooded in others. Besides the main Dividing Range, there are also other ranges extending in different parts of the country, many of them being spurs of the main chain. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Although Victoria occupies no more than the thirty-fourth part of the Australian continent, from various causes such has been its attractiveness as compared with the other States of the group, that it now contains 30 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The enumerated population, at the date of the census, 31st March, 1901, was 1,201,341, viz., 603,883 males and 597,458 females. These numbers give a proportion of 98·9 females to 100 males. The estimated population on 31st Dec., 1906, was 1,237,998, viz., 620,380 males and 617,618 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 571 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. & O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number 1,659. The postal and telegraph revenue was 789,163l. in 1906, and the expenditure 630,648l.

Victoria, with the other Australasian States, having joined the Universal Postal Union from 1st October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia.
There are 3,398 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1906, was 41,404,947L. The revenue for 1905-6 was 3,789,068L, and the expenditure 2,217,313L.

There are 6,954 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 14,950 miles of wire; also about 32,956 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1906 was 2,488,719. There are 31 telephone exchanges in the State, with 10,424 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1906 was 241,973L.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the State where railway communication is not available.

Climate.

From its geographical position Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other State of Australia. In regard to heat the weather is never severely oppressive, except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57°3'; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91°3' feet above the sea level was 29°33 inches; rain falls on the average upon 132 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25°59 inches.

History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonisation, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Phillip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by Acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year an attempt was made to colonise the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention.

Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 23rd May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the (as yet) unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements, but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shipsloads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when, on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is grazing and agriculture, 4,294,553 acres being under cultivation in 1906-07. The chief products were wheat, grown on an area of 2,031,893 acres, producing 22,618,043 bushels; oats, 380,493 acres, producing 8,845,654 bushels; barley, 52,816 acres, producing 1,255,442 bushels; potatoes, 55,372 acres, producing 166,839 tons; and hay, 621,139 acres, producing 881,276 tons. About 25,855 acres were devoted to the culture of the vine, producing 2,044,833 gallons of wine, 98,127 cwts. of raisins, and 11,730 cwts. of
currants. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. The dairying industry has made rapid strides in the last few years; in 1906 there were produced 68,088,168 lbs. of butter (of which 45,620,166 lbs. were exported) and 4,877,593 lbs. of cheese. On the 31st March, 1907, there were in the State 406,840 horses, 1,103,014 cattle, other than dairy cows, 12,937,440 sheep, and 220,452 pigs. The wool exported in 1906 amounted to 141,696,567 lbs., valued at £6,154,382. The amount of gold raised in 1906 was 834,775 ozs., making a total since 1851 of 69,202,178 ozs., valued at £276,516,978. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the State will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of coal raised in 1906 was 160,631 tons, valued at £80,283. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise nearly half of the total), are grain and flour, butter, hides and skins, meats, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea, and iron. Melbourne does 87 per cent. of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wodonga, Wahgunyah, Yarrawonga, Gooramadda, Koondrook, Tocumwal, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1906 numbered 375, with a total tonnage of 119,880.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments employing four hands or upwards, except when machinery worked by steam or other power is employed, and except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although some manufacturing industry may be carried on thereat; were this done, the manufactories of the State might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. The following is a statement of the number and nature of manufactories and hands employed therein during 1906:

Total | 4,360 | 85,229

The total number of all establishments is 4,360, of which 1,964 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 48,765. They employ 85,229 hands, and the approximate total value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant is £14,512,465. The value of materials used was £17,288,170, and of articles produced or work done £28,102,480.

The estimated value of Victorian production in 1906 was as follows:

- Agricultural Production: £7,576,547
- Pastoral and Dairying Production: £12,836,384
- Mining Production: £3,451,856
- Forest: £602,569
- Miscellaneous Production: £1,771,887

Total Primary Products: £26,242,243
Manufacturing—value added during process: £10,306,963

Total: £36,549,206
Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that great losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in some years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other States. Still, in certain districts, serious inconvenience and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation upon a large scale. By the Water Act of 1905 all existing irrigation trusts, with one exception, were abolished, and their works and duties transferred to the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. The capital expenditure on the irrigation works controlled by the Commissioners on the 30th June, 1906, amounted to £1,838,986. The Commission is empowered to levy rates on all lands capable of irrigation under their jurisdiction; the net area of which was 2,702,189 acres, the total area irrigated being 216,933 acres. In addition to the foregoing there is the Mildura Irrigation Colony, the lands, works, and approaches of which are controlled by the First Mildura Irrigation Trust. From time to time the Government has assisted the Mildura Trust until on the 30th June, 1906, the total amount advanced was £88,700, which, together with interest accumulated to that date (£15,881), represents the total indebtedness of the Trust to the Government.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, at the end of 1906, had a population of 526,400. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (48,565), Bendigo (44,140), Geelong (27,416), Warrnambool (6,630), Castlemaine (8,380), Maryborough (5,791), and Stawell (5,290).

Chinese.

By the Chinese Immigration Restriction Act, 1888, the immigration of Chinese was limited to one Chinese to every 500 tons known of any vessel arriving. There are not more than 7,500 in the State.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 612 in all, throughout the State during the last quarter of 1906: The Bank of Australasia; of New South Wales; of New Zealand; of Victoria; Colonial of Australasia; Commercial of Australia; English, Scottish and Australian; London of Australia; National of Australasia; Royal of Australia; and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £7,623,829, and the value of the notes in circulation to £86,922.

There are also 56 banks and branches, with 326 agencies at Post Offices of the Savings Bank. The number of accounts open on the 30th June, 1906, was 466,752, and the amount on deposit was £11,764,179. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of about £4,000,000 is coined annually.

Education.

Education establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognised in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1906 was 860. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1906, the total number of students who matriculated was 5,418, and 3,505 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 5 Schools of Art, 9 Schools of Mines, and 3 Working Men's Colleges; there are also 2 Agricultural and 1 Horticultural College. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the number of students enrolled in the fourth term of 1906 was 2,080.

The system of primary public instruction, which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 14, and State instruction is granted free of cost. In 1905-6 there were 1,953 State schools, with a total enrolment of 229,179 scholars, instructed by 4,598 teachers. The average attendance was 142,216. In 1905-6 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was £671,367. There is no local control over the schools. The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1905-6, there were 757 private schools in Victoria, with 2,397 teachers, and an attendance of 48,732 scholars. Of these the Roman Catholic denomination had about one-fourth, about one-third of the teachers, and over half the scholars.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is the official head of the Legislature, and assents in the name of the Crown to Acts passed by the Parliament. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 34 members elected for 17 Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 65 members returned by 65 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of
Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

The constitution of the two Houses and the qualification of Members and Electors have been amended on several occasions; and a Reform Act received the Royal Assent on 26th November, 1903. By this Act the number of Members of both Houses was reduced, the franchise for the Upper House broadened, and the property qualification for membership reduced, and several other reforms made. In 1907 an Act was assented to abolishing the separate representation of railways and public officers in the Parliament of the State—one of the provisions of the Reform Act of 1903. Officers in the service of the Government are, however, forbidden to take any part in the political affairs of the State otherwise than by recording a vote, and are prohibited from using any influence in respect to any matter affecting their remuneration or position in the public service.

One of the two Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every three years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council, except in case of a deadlock between the two Houses. The property qualification of members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 50l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 1/5 annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, matriculated students of the University of Melbourne, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-masters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered. By the Reform Act of 1903 the Council is now empowered to suggest alterations in these Bills.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage virtually exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Plural voting was abolished by an Act passed in August, 1899, so far as the election of members of the Assembly is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is, under ordinary circumstances, three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856, and by an Act passed in October, 1900, provision is made for voting by post in certain cases.

All members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year during the term of the present Parliament "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

An Act was passed in December, 1903, limiting the amount which may be expended by candidates for election expenses to 400l. and 150l., for the Council and the Assembly respectively. The purposes for which such expenditure may be incurred are also defined.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 87,234 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the State. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers, including women. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality, except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1905-06 there were 60 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 146 shires. The number of ratepayers was 323,778; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 12,174,325l.; representing a value in fee simple of 222,598,941l.; the total income in 1906 (including 95,090l. received from Government) was 1,388,292l., and the expenditure was 1,377,649l.; whilst their loan indebtedness amounted to 4,375,116l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1906 was 208,455l., and its expenditure 147,253l. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1906 amounted to 2,000,000l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now under the control of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, which body is also empowered to undertake the sewerage of the metropolis. In 1905-06 the Board's ordinary revenue was 418,849l., and its expenditure 443,740l., exclusive of 404,907l. from loans; whilst there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1906, amounting to 9,639,663l., of which, however, 1,848,663l. was raised in the first instance by the general Government, and is included in the Public Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works in course of construction amounted to 5,240,185l. up to the 30th June, 1906.

There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities and the Insurance Companies. In 1906 their revenue amounted to 54,568l., their ordinary expenditure to 56,825l., and their debt to 130,000l.

The Melbourne Tramways Trust is a Municipal Corporation, created for the purpose of constructing tramways in Melbourne and suburbs, which it has done at a cost of 1,705,794l., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. This debt will be gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a public company, to whom the lines have been let for a period of 30 years. On the 3rd January, 1907, the sinking fund amounted to 919,981l.

Defences

The land forces, chiefly militia, at the end of 1906-7 comprised an establishment of 6,497 men of all arms, of whom 407 were permanent, 5,042 formed the militia, the remainder (1,048) being volunteers. In addition to these there were about 19,750 members of Rifle Clubs.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 375 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship Cerberus, the first-class torpedo-boats Countess of Hopetoun and Childers, and the torpedo launch Gordon.
