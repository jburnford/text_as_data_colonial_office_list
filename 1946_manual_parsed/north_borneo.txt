NORTH BORNEO

It is regretted that the inclusion in this edition of the Colonial Office List of up-to-date descriptive matter relating to North Borneo has not been possible owing to the fact that this territory was still under military administration when material was being prepared for publication. An up-to-date statement will, however, be included in the next edition. Information relating to this territory before the Japanese occupation will be found in pages 539 to 542 of the Dominions Office and Colonial Office List for 1940.
