PALESTINE

Situation and Area

Palestine is bounded on the north by the republics of Syria and Lebanon, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian province of Sinai (the boundary running from a point west of Rafah on the Mediterranean to a point two miles to the west of where the course of the Wadi 'Araba joins the Gulf of 'Aqaba) and on the east by Trans-Jordan.

The frontier runs from the Mediterranean at Ras en Naqura eastwards to Yarun (in Lebanon), thence north-east to the village of Qadas, thence north-north-east to Metulla and across to Tell el Qadi (in Palestine) and Banyas (in Syria) thence south-south-west to Jisr Banat Ya'qub, thence southwards but keeping about a kilometre east of the Jordan to the Lake of Tiberias, thence along the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias to a point almost due east of the town of Tiberias, thence south-south-east to El Hamme station on the Hejaz railway.

The frontier with Trans-Jordan is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of 'Aqaba on the Gulf of 'Aqaba up the centre of the Wadi 'Araba, of the Dead Sea and of the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmuq, thence up the centre of the River Yarmuq to the Syrian frontier.

The total land area is 10,157 square miles; in addition there is an inland water area of 272 square miles, comprising Lake Hula, Lake Tiberias (the Sea of Galilee) and the Dead Sea (half of which is taken as belonging to Palestine); so that the total area of the country is 10,429 square miles.

There are four zones of country:

(a) The hill country of Galilee and Judaea.
(b) The five plains, including that lying in the rift of the Jordan Valley, which, from the north of Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea, is actually below the level of the Mediterranean.
(c) The Beersheba area, different in character and population from the rest of the country.
(d) The desert area.

The five plains are: the Acre Plain, the Plain of Esdraelon, the Huleh Plain, the Coastal Plain and the Plain of the Jordan.

For administrative purposes the country is divided into six districts—Galilee district with Nazareth as its centre; Haifa district; Samaria district with Nablus as its centre; Jerusalem district; Lydda district with Jaffa-Tel Aviv as its centre and Gaza district—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Climate

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude and with the distance from the sea. Accordingly, temperatures are warm in summer and mild in winter in the coastal plain, moderate in summer and cold in winter in the hills, and hot in summer and mild in winter in the Jordan Valley. Humidity decreases from west to east, but is locally modified by altitude and inland water bodies. Rainfall is dependent on altitude, distance from the sea and geographical latitude. Annual amounts thus vary between 45 inches in the hills of Upper Galilee and about 1 inch in the 'Aqaba area, with 15–30 inches in the major part of the settled areas of the country. The rainy season starts in October and lasts until May, with about two-thirds to three-quarters of the rainfall amounts concentrated during the period December to February.

Water for domestic use is obtained in the larger towns from piped supplies; in the smaller towns and rural districts from cisterns in which rain water is collected or from small springs or wells.

Malaria, which was formerly very prevalent, has now been eradicated from the large towns, and in rural areas a very marked reduction in incidence has been effected as a result of various large drainage schemes, anti-larval control, as well as by mass treatment of the population in those areas where the incidence of the disease was very high. One or two highly endemic areas remain to be dealt with on a permanent basis.

Epidemic diseases are not unduly prevalent.

Government

Under Turkish rule part of Palestine was in the Vilayet (province) of Beirut and part in the Sanjak (district) of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British forces, the country remained under British military administration until July, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a civil administration set up.

By the treaty of peace, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Palestine. The Principal Allied Powers had selected His Britannic Majesty as mandatory at the conference at San Remo on 25th April, 1920. The terms of the mandate were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on 24th July, 1922, and the mandate came into force on 29th September, 1923. The mandatory is responsible, inter alia, for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour declaration of 2nd November, 1917, viz., "His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

On 1st September, 1922, a constitution was promulgated.

Under this constitution Palestine is governed by a High Commissioner, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, assisted by an Executive Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and Commissioner on Special Duty, and by an Advisory Council consisting of official members.

An attempt was made in 1923 to create the Legislative Council provided for in the constitution, but owing to the refusal of the Arabs to take
part in the elections, it was replaced by the Advisory Council in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as a Legislative Council is created.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

In 1921 the Supreme Moslem Sharia Council was constituted for the control and management of the Moslem Awqaf and Affairs in Palestine. It is composed of a president, known also as Rais-Al-Ulema, and four members.

The control of Moslem Awqaf includes the supervision and maintenance of all Moslem shrines, religious buildings and Moslem endowed institutions. Since its formation the Council has, inter alia, established a large Moslem orphanage at Jerusalem.

Extensive repairs have been and are being carried out on many mosques, notably those in the Haram el Sherif at Jerusalem.

The Supreme Moslem Sharia Court is also entrusted with the administration of the Sharia (Moslem religious) courts.

Regulations were made under the Religious Communities Ordinance, 1926, by the High Commissioner in 1927 for the organisation of the Jewish community in Palestine. The Jewish community, like the Moslem and the various Christian communities, enjoys autonomy in the administration of its internal affairs, religious, cultural and communal; it has also power to levy rates on its members. The organs of the community are a Chief Rabbinate and local rabbinical offices, an elected assembly, a general council which is elected by the assembly and represents the community in its dealings with the Government, and local communities.

Complete freedom in their communal affairs is allowed to those Jewish congregations who have exercised the option to remain outside the recognised community.

The Jewish Agency is recognised as the representative body of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish national home: it is represented in Palestine by an executive whose headquarters are at Jerusalem.

The Palestine Government has maintained in force the status and privileges accorded to the different Christian communities under the Ottoman regime.

A Royal Commission visited Palestine in 1936-37, and submitted certain recommendations to His Majesty’s Government in their report published in July, 1937 (Cmd. 5479). In the following year a technical commission was appointed to examine certain aspects of the Royal Commission’s recommendations and submitted a report (Cmd. 5854). On 18th May, 1939, a White Paper embodying a statement of policy by His Majesty’s Government was issued (Cmd. 6019).

The affairs of the towns are administered by municipal councils presided over by mayors. In large villages local councils have been set up.

District town planning commissions have now replaced the former Central Town Planning Commission and deal with town planning schemes in their districts put forward by local town planning commissions both for municipal and rural areas. A Town Planning Adviser who is ex officio member of all the district town planning commissions is attached to the office of the Attorney-General. The preparation of regional schemes under his direction are now being considered.

**POPULATION**

A revised de facto estimate of the total population at 31st December, 1944, based on natural and migratory increase, is 1,764,520—of whom 1,061,270 were Moslems (including Nomad Bedouins, estimated to number 66,553, as at the census of 1931), 553,600 Jews, 135,550 Christians and 14,100 others.

Jerusalem, the chief town, had a population of 157,080.

The population figures of the other principal towns, arranged according to size at the end of 1944, were:

- Tel-Aviv, 166,660; Haifa, 128,800; Jaffa, 94,310; Gaza, 34,170; Hebron, 24,360; Nablus, 23,250; Petah-Tiqva, 17,250; Lydda, 16,780; Ramle, 15,160; Nazareth, 14,200; Acre, 12,360; Safad, 11,930; Tiberias, 11,310; Bethlehem, 8,820.

**JERUSALEM**

The capital, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917.

The Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic churches. The site of Solomon’s temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. The Western Wall, better known as the Wailing Wall, is part of the outer wall of the Temple, and is sacred to Jews throughout the world.

Bethlehem, the scene of Christ’s Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Basilica of the Nativity, at the east end of the present town, was built by St. Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine, about A.D. 330 and enlarged by the Emperor Justinian (A.D. 527-565).

**BANKING, CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND CURRENCY**

The most important bank in Palestine is Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Nablus, Nazareth, and agencies at Acre, Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road North (Tel-Aviv), Ramat Gan, Gaza and Hebron. The Anglo-Palestine Bank Ltd. has its head office in Palestine at Tel-Aviv with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad, Petah-Tiqvah, Hedera, Rehovoth, and agencies at Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road (Tel-Aviv), North Branch (Tel-Aviv Herzl Street Branch). Affiliated with the Anglo-Palestine Bank Ltd. is the General Mortgage Bank of Palestine Ltd., with head office at Tel-Aviv, which grants mortgage loans on houses. In addition there are branches in Jerusalem of the Ottoman Bank (also in Haifa, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nablus and Amman in Trans-Jordan), the Holland Bank Union at Haifa, and the Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. (Bank P.K.O.) in Tel-Aviv and Haifa. There are also the Workers’ Bank Ltd., the Zerbubel Bank Co-operative Society Ltd. at Tel-Aviv and the Central Bank of Co-operative Institutions in Jerusalem, which grant credit to co-operative societies.

Following the appointment of the Examiner of Banks, the Banking Ordinance was amended in 1936. Accordingly all banks (foreign and local) are required to submit monthly statements of their assets and liabilities as at the end of each month. Summary statements showing the aggregated
figures of commercial banks are published monthly by the Department of Statistics, Jerusalem. On 31st December, 1945, the aggregate amount of time and demand deposits held by the 5 foreign banks and the 20 local banks amounted to £P.78,137,731, while the total amount of credit granted by these institutions in the form of advances and/or bills discounted amounted to £P.24,391,199.

The co-operative movement is extensively established among the Jewish population, both urban and rural. There is a Registrar of Cooperative Societies whose duties include the encouragement of the growth of a similar movement among the Arab farmers. At the end of December, 1945, the aggregate amount of the deposits held by 83 Jewish Credit Co-operative Societies amounted to £P.8,665,501, while the amount of credit granted to their members in the form of advances and/or bills discounted amounted to £P.2,858,885.

A Currency Board was appointed in London in 1926 in order to introduce and control a Palestine currency based on the pound sterling; and the new currency was issued on 1st November, 1927, under the authority of an Order of His Majesty-in-Council, dated 7th February, 1927.

The standard of currency is the Palestine pound (£P.), divided into 1,000 mils. The Palestine Currency order provides for a gold coin of one Palestine pound containing 123·27447 grains of standard gold (the equivalent of the English sovereign). It is not intended at present to introduce gold coins. The Currency Board has issued silver coins of 100 and 50 mils, nickel bronze coins of 20, 10 and 5 mils, bronze coins of 2 and 1 mils, and currency notes of £P.100, £P.50, £P.10, £P.5, £P.1 and 500 mils. The currency notes are legal tender for the amounts expressed therein. Silver coins are legal tender for the payment of £P.2, nickel bronze coins of 20 and 10 mils are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 200 mils, and coins of lower denomination are legal tender for an amount not exceeding 100 mils. The amount of Palestine currency in circulation at 31st January, 1946, was: Coins, £P.1,697,110, notes, £P.45,241,031.

The metric system is adopted by Government and is being made compulsory in trade in progressive stages under the Weights and Measures Ordinance, 1944. The first step was the introduction of metric weights in the four major towns, namely, Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv and Haifa in August, 1944, followed by the extension to the whole of Palestine on 1st September, 1945, which finally abolished the variety of local weights used before.

The sections detailed above include 417 miles of railway line operated, but not owned, by the Palestine Railways.

The section of the railway from Kantara to Rafa is in Egyptian territory. It is owned by His Majesty’s Government on whose behalf it is operated by the Palestine Railways.
There are through connections with Egypt and Syria. Trains connect at Kantara West with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez and other parts of Egypt, goods vehicles crossing the canal over the Firdan bridge. Trains connect at the junction station of Samakh with Damascus, the capital of Syria.

East of Haifa the Palestine railways extend to Ma’an in Trans-Jordan. The line is known as the Hijaz Railway, and, with the exception of the section from Samakh to Nessib which is owned and operated by the Chemin de Fer du Hijaz in Syria, is operated by the Palestine Railways in trust on behalf of the Palestine Government.

The following rolling stock is owned by the Palestine Railways:

| Standard Gauge | Narrow Gauge |
|----------------|--------------|
| Locomotives    | 72           |
| Coaching stock | 89           |
| Goods stock    | 2,094        |

In addition to the foregoing rolling stock, locomotives and wagons are hired from the War Department as required, while considerable numbers of foreign-owned vehicles circulate on the system under coaching and wagon exchange agreements.

The Palestine Railways took over in 1943 the administration of all ports in Palestine. The principal ports are the modern deep water harbour of Haifa and the roadstead harbour of Jaffa. There are minor ports at Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee, at Jodeda on the Dead Sea, at Acre and at Gaza along the coast.

Haifa port is a deep water harbour with a total water area of 279 acres enclosed by a main breakwater 7,250 feet in length and a lee breakwater 2,510 feet long. Maximum depth of water 37 feet, minimum 30-8 feet. Principal docking facilities comprise the main wharf 1,312 lineal feet in length, a cargo jetty of 885 lineal feet and an oil jetty 1,050 feet long. The latter is enclosed in an oil dock in which all bulk oils are handled. Subsidiary docking facilities comprise an extension of the main wharf, 361 feet, and lighter wharves, 574 feet. Submarine pipe lines extend into Acre Bay and enable ships to load and discharge bulk oils in the roadstead. A slipway for small craft is available.

Modern transit shed accommodation provides 242,000 square feet of covered storage space, while stacking areas in the open can accommodate 30,000 tons of cargo.

Rail connection is provided to all areas in the harbour. The port is adequately equipped with craneage facilities and with numerous lighters and towing craft.

Jaffa port is a roadstead harbour with a lighter basin at each of its southern and northern sections. The southern basin is enclosed in a breakwater 480 metres in length and contains a water area of 41,500 square metres of a maximum depth of 2 metres. Three quays in the basin provide berthing facilities for lighters and other small craft.

Modern transit shed accommodation with a floor area of 22,400 square metres is provided, while subsidiary warehouses and open stacking areas respectively provide a further 1,240 and 7,000 square metres floor area of storage space. Adequate craneage facilities and floating equipment are available.

The northern section, known as the Tel-Aviv lighter harbour, consists of a roadstead with an enclosed lighter basin covering 14,000 square metres dredged to a maximum depth of 2 metres.

The port was constructed in 1936 by private enterprise and is owned and operated by the Marine Trust, Ltd., subject to supervision by the Palestine Railways in certain administrative matters.

The Palestine railways and ports are managed and controlled by the General Manager of Railways, who is also the Ports Authority. The General Manager is also Chairman of the Transport Advisory Board, which is composed of official and non-official members and is appointed to advise Government on any matters relating to transport by road, rail, sea or air, including questions of policy, legislation, economy and planning which may be referred to it by Government.

The empowering enactments governing the management and organisation of the railways and ports are the Railway Ordinance, 1936, the Ports Ordinance and the rules and regulations made thereunder.

Roads

There are (at the end of 1945) 1,650 miles of roads in Palestine suitable for motor traffic in all weathers and, in addition, 970 miles of seasonal track passable for wheel traffic of all kinds.

Air

In 1945 13,790(*) passengers were recorded as arriving from abroad or proceeding abroad by air. The aggregate weight of letter mail discharged from and taken on aircraft was 27,283(*) kgs.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Health Facilities

Health facilities are provided by the Government Department of Health, voluntary and private organisations, and medical and dental practitioners; 4,483 hospital beds are available, representing a ratio of 2·7 beds per mille of the population.

The Department of Health conducts a comprehensive environmental sanitation service based on district and sub-district health offices. This service includes an anti-malarial section, a quarantine and disinfection service, 41 ante-natal and infant welfare clinics, and a school health service. The department also conducts 35 out-patient clinics and 43 anti-rabic treatment centres in the towns and larger villages, and maintains 1,642 hospital beds in 13 hospitals (422 beds for infectious diseases, 464 for mental diseases, and 756 for general diseases). New mental, tuberculosis and general hospitals are included in plans for post-war expansion. An ambulance service and a mobile ophthalmic treatment unit are maintained. The Department of Health also conducts a laboratory service which comprises a central laboratory and vaccine institute in Jerusalem, two branch laboratories in Jaffa and Haifa, and six clinical laboratories attached to Government hospitals. These laboratories undertake all routine and special public health and clinical investigations, while the vaccine institute manufactures all the anti-rabic, anti-smallpox, anti-enteric and other vaccines required for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes throughout the country.

Among the voluntary institutions, the Hadas-sah Organisation maintains 442 hospital beds (including Safad Tuberculosis Hospital (58 beds)) and a number of health centres in Jewish areas, while the Jewish Sick Fund (a co-operative sick benefit society) possesses 240 beds and provides clinics, domiciliary treatment, and sickness cash benefits for its subscribers. In addition to a large general hospital of 315 beds, which the Jewish municipality of Tel-Aviv conducts together with a comprehensive clinic, school and sanitary services, 11 voluntary general hospitals, totalling 868 beds, are provided elsewhere by various secular and religious organisations.

Private hospitals comprise a total of 421 beds, a considerable proportion of which are utilised for maternity work and the care of mental cases.

The number of licensed medical practitioners in Palestine at the end of 1945 was 2,625, making a ratio of one doctor per 670 members of the population; 2,338 of these were Jews. There were 791 registered dental practitioners.

Education

Since the civil administration started in 1920 a dual system of national education has gradually developed, formed on a linguistic and racial basis, according to the language of instruction, Arabic or Hebrew. Into one or other of these systems all schools, public or private except some of these maintained by foreign bodies, naturally fall.

Government, with growing co-operation by local authorities, directly administers and maintains the large majority of Arab public schools, formerly conducted by the Turkish Government. The pupils are predominantly Moslems. Certain Moslem societies and the Christian Arab communities have continued and developed their schools under autonomous control. Many of these are regarded as quasi-public and receive substantial Government grants. There is also a large number of proprietary Moslem schools.

The Jewish elementary public school system is administered in collaboration with local authorities by the Council of the Jewish community (Va'ad Leumi) under the controlling supervision of Government. The Va'ad Leumi also supervises most of the Jewish secondary schools, which are known as public though they are privately owned and maintained almost entirely out of fees. There are also a number of other Jewish Schools outside the public system.

Central Government funds for education are distributed annually to the two communities strictly on the basis of their respective school-age.
populations (5-15 years). These funds are supplemented by local rates, private contributions and school fees. By this means and by contributions from abroad the Jewish and Christian communities achieve almost universal education. The Moslems, who receive no assistance from abroad, are still far from enjoying education facilities equal to the demand both in towns and villages. In particular there are few rural girls' schools.

In 1943-4 there were 422 Government Arab schools with 63,141 pupils. In addition there were 327 non-Government schools for Arabs with 42,227 pupils; many of the latter fulfil a public function as quasi-public schools.

There are 17 public Arab secondary schools, of which four continue to matriculation standard. Two Government colleges contain post-matriculation classes, and Government maintains one trade school, one agricultural school and one commercial school for Arabs; Government teachers are trained in five institutions.

In the Hebrew public system 1943-4 there were 551 schools with 73,133 pupils. These include 29 secondary schools with 9,073 pupils, six training colleges and nine agricultural and vocational schools. In addition there were 324 other Jewish schools with 24,858 pupils.

In 1944-5 Government spent £P.547,010 on Arab education and £P.146,225 on Jewish education. The total expenditure on education from all sources, however, was greater. The Arabs spent approximately £P.300,000 in school fees at non-Government schools and approximately £P.50,000 in supplementary Government provision in public schools. The Jews spent approximately £P.1,200,000 on public schools of which, apart from the Government grant above mentioned and a grant of £P.120,000 from the Jewish Agency, about one half was derived from local rates and one half from fees. The expenditure on non-public schools is estimated at £P.300,000, of which rather more than one half was derived from fees.

The Palestine Board of Higher Studies conducts public examinations of Matriculation, Intermediate and Degree standard through the medium of each of the three official languages. Various other public examinations are conducted by the Department of Education on behalf of British examining authorities.

In 1945 there were 411 candidates for Palestine matriculation and 930 candidates for London matriculation.

There is as yet no university in Palestine for Arabs, but, in co-operation with the British Council, existing post-matriculation courses may soon develop into full university courses in the faculties of arts and science.

The Hebrew University in Jerusalem, originally a centre mainly for post-graduate research, now has a considerable undergraduate body. Hebrew is the medium of instruction and it serves as a spiritual and cultural focus for Jewish scholarship throughout the world.

In 1944-5 there were 155 teachers and 610 students. The library contains nearly 400,000 volumes. The estimated expenditure in 1944-5 was £P.236,000.

Labour Service

Prior to 1942 no arrangements existed for the regulation by Government of industrial relations, and no government department was specifically entrusted with the administration of the labour legislation in force. The Department of Labour was set up in 1942. The mission of the department, as defined in the Department of Labour Ordinance, is to safeguard and promote the general welfare of workers and to maintain good relations between workers and employers. Special duties prescribed in the same ordinance are supervision of conditions of employment, enforcement of laws relating to the welfare of workers, terms of their employment, labour exchanges and industrial relations, settlement of trade disputes, prevention of accidents, introduction of safety devices and high standards of industrial hygiene, collection and publication of statistics relating to labour matters.

The department is organised as a central office in Jerusalem with three regional offices. The central office includes a research and intelligence section which, among other duties, deals with the statistical side of the department's activities and with the department's publications. A quarterly Department of Labour Bulletin is issued in English, Arabic and Hebrew. The war-time activities of the Department of Labour included the control of man power, recommendations for priority releases from the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force of personnel needed by agriculture, industry or education, and the resettlement of ex-servicemen. The latter task, which may also be described as a specific branch of post-war activities, has necessitated the establishment of resettlement sections at the central office and at the regional offices of the Department of Labour.

The labour legislation in force at the end of 1945 covered the following subjects: duties of the Department of Labour and powers of inspectors of labour; regulation of the conditions of employment of women, children and young persons; workmen's compensation for industrial accidents; notification of accidents and occupational diseases; safety and hygiene—the Factories Ordinance which was promulgated in 1946 and will come into force in 1947 establishes standards of safety and hygiene in industry and supersedes the previously existing laws relating to fencing of machinery and safe use of steam boilers, and part of the trade and industry regulations; the establishment of trade boards, with the object of securing a proper standard of living and minimum conditions of employment for workers employed in insufficiently organised industries.

No permanent legislation governing industrial relations has yet been enacted, but a Trade Disputes Order has been operative as a piece of emergency legislation designed to prevent stoppages of work in important war industries and to provide machinery for conciliation and arbitration.

An Industrial Relations Ordinance and a Trade Unions Ordinance were under consideration at the end of 1945.

In certain matters relating to conditions of employment the established customs are ahead of legislative provisions, especially among organised labour. For instance, although there is no legislation concerning weekly day of rest, a weekly day of rest is with very few exceptions granted in industrial and business undertakings; similarly, there is no legislation providing for working hours of adult workers, but an eight hours' working day is the rule in Jewish industry and in many Arab undertakings and British-owned firms. The practice of paying dismissal indemnities and contributions for sickness insurance and old age insurance is widespread in organised industry.

There are no public employment offices in Palestine. Jewish labour exchanges are maintained
in the largest towns and agricultural settlements; these exchanges are administered by the Jewish trade unions and are financially supported and supervised by the Jewish Agency for Palestine.

There is no legislation in Palestine discriminating against employees in the matter of rights of association, and there exist a number of trade union organisations, both Arab and Jewish. The Trade Disputes Order referred to above has given legal recognition to employer's associations and worker's unions representing the interests of their members involved in trade disputes.

The largest trade union organisation in Palestine is the General Federation of Jewish Labour, which has a membership of about 150,000, and embraces a substantial majority of the Jewish wage and salary earners. The General Federation of Jewish Labour maintains a number of social services for their members—a widely ramified health service, educational institutions, a daily newspaper and many other publications, an unemployment relief fund, funds for the grant of old age pensions and the like. A large number of co-operative undertakings in agriculture, industry and transport, and a number of financial institutions and industrial enterprises are affiliated to the General Federation of Jewish Labour.

The Arab trade union movement, comprising 15,000 to 20,000 members, is a relatively recent formation but its influence is felt in industrial relations. Some of the Arab trade unions maintain a number of co-operative societies, an employment bureau in Haifa and health services on a small scale. One of the branches of the Arab trade union movement publishes a labour weekly.

Social Welfare Service

The Department of Social Welfare was established in October, 1944. The work of the department is divided into two main sections, each with its separate staff:

(1) Probation, which includes the treatment of juvenile delinquency and the social work of the law courts.

(2) Welfare.

The department is directly responsible for the administration of the probation system, reformatory schools, remand homes, the boarding school for blind Arab boys and the relief of destitution in the Arab community. In addition, the department controls the vote for making grants from central funds to local welfare schemes and voluntary charitable institutions. It also deals with the problem of war refugees, distressed British subjects and other destitute persons not provided for by other bodies.

Grants to local welfare schemes are made to municipalities, and to the Jewish community for specific purposes such as the feeding of undernourished children, clubs, the relief of destitution, etc. The budget of the department for the year 1945-46 was £P.289,538. In 1944-45 the budget was £P.220,603, out of which the sum of £P.192,518 was spent on direct welfare activities including grants to local institutions.

A further sum of £P.20,000 was included in the department's budget for the purpose of assisting disabled ex-servicemen for the period from discharge to rehabilitation.

In addition to the Government Department of Social Welfare there exist very extensive Jewish welfare services, which cater for the Jewish community alone and which involve the care and maintenance of new immigrants, relief and aid to unemployed or destitute persons, the provision of school luncheons for under-nourished children, the establishment of homes for the aged, clubs, orphanages, etc., and the placement in private families or institutions of neglected, difficult or problem children.

These social services are controlled by the Social Service Department of the General Council (Va'ad Leumi) of the Jewish community. The work is organised locally as an activity of the social bureaux of the local community councils (Va'ade Hakehilloth). Tel-Aviv has a Municipal Department of Social Welfare, responsible for all the social services which in other Jewish communities are supervised by the Social Welfare Department of the Va'ad Leumi.
