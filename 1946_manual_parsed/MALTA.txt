### MALTA



**Situation and Area**



The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 94·870 square miles; that of Gozo 23·899 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filflia and Cominotto are mere islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.



**History**



The Maltese Islands were inhabited as early as the beginning of the Mousterian cultural period, about 40,000 B.C., by Neanderthal man, of whom remains were discovered in a cave to the south-east of Malta. Traces of paleolithic civilization are not wanting in the islands, and evidence of a neolithic civilization, in the shape of cave dwellings, stone circles, menhirs and dolmens, is found all over the islands. The Phoenicians probably took possession of Malta as soon as they made themselves masters of the Mediterranean Sea. Phoenician remains are few, but there are numerous rock-cut graves of Phoenician type.



At the beginning of the Punic wars the islands were held by Carthage. In the course of the first Punic war they changed hands more than once, but at its conclusion they were still in the possession of the Carthaginians. In 218 B.C. they passed finally to Rome. Under the Romans Malta appears to have enjoyed great prosperity. Diodorus Siculus speaks of the excellence of its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, and its many skilful artificers, and refers to its fertility, and Cicero, in the Verrine orations, speaks of it as abounding in riches and famous for its textile manufactures. Inscriptions show that it enjoyed municipal rights in the time of Hadrian, and an interesting fact in its recorded history is that it was the scene of St. Paul’s shipwreck (Acts xxviii). On the final division of the Empire in 395 A.D., Malta fell to the share of the Byzantine Emperor, and for the next four centuries its history is almost a blank. In the 9th century it was three times invaded by the Arabs, who finally conquered it in 870, the Byzantine garrison being massacred in an insurrection of the inhabitants.



In 1090, Count Roger the Norman, with a handful of men, subjected the islands to Sicily. The Sicilian domination lasted for four hundred years, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and Castilian ruling in turn. During this time, Malta had Sicilian governors and laws, but there is no record of any extensive Sicilian immigration, and the persistence of the old Semitic names in the parish registers, instituted at this period, stands as further evidence that no great ethnographic changes occurred.



The connection with Sicily was broken in 1530, when the Emperor Charles V gave Malta to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who had been driven from Rhodes by the Turks, and who held Malta until 1798. The loyalty of the Maltese to their new sovereigns, who for the first time were resident in the island, was put to a severe test on several occasions, the most notable being the great siege of 1565, when the Order of St. John, under Grand Master Jean de la Valette, resisted the attacks of the land and sea forces of Soliman the Magnificent. It was after this great feat of

arms that the city of Valletta was built, strong enough to defy the Turkish attacks threatened yearly by the Sultan.



Napoleon Bonaparte invested the island on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda, and, on 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed.



The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.



In 1800 the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.



Malta was awarded the George Cross on 15th April, 1942, for the part she played in the Second Great War.



**CLIMATE**



The climate of Malta is very healthy. No excessive periods of hot or cold weather are felt. The climatic conditions are much influenced by the friable nature and sponginess of the layers of rock. The temperature depends on the dominant westerlies. The lowest temperature in 1938, 43·2° F., was registered on 8th January, and the highest, 99·2° F., on the 13th August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in sub-tropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the Sirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) for the last ten years is 58·7° F., and the mean minimum 51·3°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August and September) the mean maximum is 80·6° F., and the mean minimum 70·4°. The mean annual temperature is 65·1° and the mean annual rainfall is 19·9 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous calcareous stone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.



**INDUSTRY**



The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, early potatoes, onions, cumin seed and oranges are exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepôt and port of call. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1945, 35 vessels, 29,138 gross tonnage.



**CHIEF TOWNS**



The chief town and capital is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population which, in April, 1931, when a census was last taken, was 51,898. The "Three Cities" (Senglea, Cospicua and Vittoriosa) had a population of 26,419. Città Vecchia (or Notabile, in Maltese Mdina), the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, had a population of 10,032. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), with a population of about 5,531.



**INHABITANTS AND LANGUAGE**



The Maltese language, which is universally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is akin to Arabic. The educated and commercial classes also speak English, and some Italian. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found in Algeria, the Regency of Tunis, Egypt, Canada, Australia, and the United States.



**Banking and Currency**



The legal tender currency is, under Order-in-Council of 24th September, 1886, and Ordinance I of 1929, exclusively British. By Ordinance XLVIII of 1939, however, local sterling currency was placed in circulation in denominations of 1l., 10s., 5s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and 1s., and is legal tender concurrently with the British notes and coins. All notes locally issued are covered by an equal amount of sterling deposited in a Note Security Fund with the Crown Agents for the Colonies. The amount of British notes in circulation on 31st March, 1945, was approximately £1,000,000. Local currency in circulation on the same date was £11,316,888 5s. Od.



The two local banks, the Bank of Malta and the Anglo-Maltese Bank, are now amalgamated under the name of the National Bank of Malta. Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) and the Credit Foncier d'Algerie et de Tunisie both have branches in the island. There is also Sciclunias' Bank which is a private bank. On 31st March, 1945, deposits in the Government Savings Bank, established in 1833, amounted to £9,319,108 with 38,583 depositors.



**Means of Communication**



Motor bus services run between all the towns and villages. The telephone service is under Government control with exchanges at Floriana, Sliema, Rabat, St. Paul's Bay and Gozo. The head office is at Merchants Street, Valletta. The number of exchange lines totals 3,031, with 3,951 stations. Malta is an important station of Cable & Wireless, Ltd., whose direct cables connect with Alexandria (5), Gibraltar (5), Bona (2), Tripoli, Sicily and Zante. Through these cables telegraphic communication is maintained through the company's system with all parts of the world. The company also operates a coast station for communication with ships at sea.



Malta is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is an important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling at any hour, day and night. Owing to lack of accommodation, due to war damage, all civilians wishing to enter Malta must obtain an entry permit from the Lieutenant Governor's office.



There is a direct mail communication with several Mediterranean ports and with England. The rates of postage are as follows:



**Letters**



Local—First oz., 1d.; every additional oz., ½d.

To the United Kingdom, British dominions, protectorates and colonies, Egypt, the U.S.A., Tangier and H.M. Forces—First oz., 2½d.; every additional oz., 1¼d.

To other countries and places—First oz., 3d.; every additional oz., 2d.



**Postcards**



Local, 1d.; Imperial, 2d.; foreign, 2d.

Newspapers



Local, ½d. for each 2 oz.



In the case of a local newspaper exceeding in weight 2 oz., the rate will not be more than 1½d.



Foreign, ½d. for each 2 oz.



Public Works



The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works were commenced in 1899, and Cottonera, Sliema, St. Julian’s Msida, Pieta, Kalkara, Zabbar, Hamrun, Qormi, Mdina, Rabat, Tarxien, Pawla, Zejtun, Birkirkara, Balzan and Attard, parts of Lija and Luqa and other places have been drained. Small extensions are also being continually made in new streets as they are opened in the towns and villages. The intercepting sewer to Ghaxaq and Zebugg has been completed and that to Mosta is well in hand. The sewering of the streets of Ghaxaq has been started. The drainage of Gozo has also been commenced and Victoria, Fontana and Għainselem have been drained. Considerable progress has been made in improving the roads and streets in accordance with the exigencies of modern traffic. The main roads are being asphalted. So far 4·85 miles have been surfaced with sheet asphalt and 124·5 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing.



Since 1937 a scheme for the collection and disposal of domestic refuse has been in operation in Valletta, Floriana, Gzira, Msida, Ta’ Xbiex, Sliema and St. Julian’s. In August, 1939, the service was extended to the military areas at St. George’s, St. Andrew’s and Tigne’. Recently the service has been extended also to Albert Town and a part of Hamrun. The refuse collecting fleet serve an approximate aggregate population of 68,000. A pulverising plant has been installed at the refuse disposal centre, Marsa, for treating the refuse collected, which is then utilised as a fertiliser.



The water supply is now extended to all the villages in Malta and Gozo, and works of considerable importance are carried out each year to augment and improve it.



Electric current for lighting and power has been extended to all the towns in Malta, and to all the villages, with the exception of a few of the smaller ones situated at a distance from the supply area. In Gozo current is available to the public in the chief town, Victoria, which has its own generating station, and in the important villages of Xewkija, Għajnsielem, Nadur, Mgarr.



Constitution



A Council of Government, partly elected, was constituted by Letters Patent in 1849, and reconstituted in 1887, the Letters Patent being amended in 1898 and again in 1903.



By Letters Patent dated 14th April, 1921, responsible government was established in Malta.



This constitution was suspended from 1930 to 1932 and again on 2nd November, 1933, the Senate and Legislative Assembly being dissolved from the same date. It was finally revoked by the Letters Patent, dated 12th August, 1936, which were proclaimed in Malta on 2nd September, 1936.



The Letters Patent dated 14th February, 1939, which re-established representative government in Malta, provide for an Executive Council consisting of five ex-officio members and such other persons as the Governor may appoint, and of a Council of Government consisting of five ex-officio members, three official members, 10 elected members and two members nominated by the Governor.



According to the Letters Patent, the English language, as the official language of the British Empire, and the Maltese language, as the language of the people of Malta, are the official languages of Malta. The English language is the official language of administration, and the Maltese language is the official language in all the courts of law in Malta. Provision has been made by ordinance for the use of the English language in any proceedings before any court where any party or any accused person is a person who does not speak Maltese as the principal language to which he is accustomed. Where the proceedings are in a language not known to the party or parties or to the accused, they are translated.



The Maltese language is the language of general intercourse in the islands.



Finance



The revenue from all sources is paid into a consolidated fund, out of which the public service is supplied.



Appointments to public offices in Malta are made by the Governor, subject to the provision of the colonial regulations.



Education and Religion



Elementary education is carried on principally in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are six secondary schools with 1,524 scholars, 101 primary schools with an average enrolment of 38,500 pupils, and an average attendance of 36,200. There is a university (founded in 1769) with an average attendance of about 250 students. The fees are comparatively low, ranging from 142s. to 213s. per annum in the Lyceum and £10 per annum, exclusive of laboratory and other fees, for all lectures in the university. There are 21 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects, with an attendance of 331; 69 trade schools with an attendance of 1,666 and 236 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 4,851. There are numerous private, elementary and secondary schools. The total number of these schools is about 41, with an attendance of about 6,260 pupils. In 1946 an ordinance was enacted making education between the ages of 6 and 14 compulsory; the ordinance will be brought into force gradually, district by district. English and Maltese are the only languages of instruction in the primary schools.



The Roman Catholic religion is by law the religion of the country, but full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship are guaranteed, and persons of any faith may hold any office.



Customs Tariff



Until 1917 only specific duties were levied, the main headings being grain, wine, beer, spirits, cattle, petroleum, sugar and tobacco.



In January, 1917, ad valorem duties were introduced. These rates now vary from 6 per cent. to 40 per cent., and embrace all commodities not already affected by specific duties, and not included in a list of exempted articles which—



(a) Under food and drink shows butter, cheese, coffee, milk (fresh or preserved), eggs in the shell, tea and cocoa, and certain other articles.

(b) Under raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured shows coal, coke, patent fuel and fuel oil, sponges, vegetables and flower seeds and certain other articles.



(c) Under manufactured articles, includes agricultural machines, books, cinema films, wrapping and printing paper, laundry soap of British Empire origin, yarns for lace-making, if of silk (excluding artificial) and linen, twines, certain materials used for cap-making, shoe-making, and bag-making, and certain articles used for divine worship.



(d) Under miscellaneous and unclassified articles, includes articles imported by Government departments—bullion and specie, pedigree animals, fertilizers, and engravings, drawings and paintings representing Maltese views and subjects of local interest.



In 1934 Empire preferential duties were adopted. These duties affect boots and shoes, spirits, leaf tobacco, wheat, flour, cement, laundry soap, arms and ammunition, articles of gold, silver and platinum and plated goods, confectionery and chocolate, furniture and cabinetware, motor vehicles, wireless sets, pianos and organs, and a number of articles falling under the designation of "goods unenumerated". Ad valorem goods enjoy a preference of 5 to 15 per cent. as against the rates for the general tariff.



The general tariff shows an addition over the Empire preferential tariff of 50 per cent. in the case of boots and shoes, 1s. per litre for spirits, and 6d. per kilo for leaf tobacco.



The amount of duty collected in 1945 from specific duties was £972,856 and from ad valorem duties was £446,448.



The value of imports in 1945 from the United Kingdom was £4,392,987, from other parts of the British Empire £1,829,792, and from foreign countries £2,838,623, and from ships' stores, etc., £3,119, the respective percentages of imports being: United Kingdom, 48·46 per cent.; other parts of the British Empire, 20·20 per cent. and foreign countries 31·31 per cent., ships' stores, 0·03 per cent.



The value of domestic exports in 1945 to the United Kingdom was £29,605, to other parts of the British Empire £1,585, to foreign countries £35,965. The respective percentages were: to United Kingdom 44·1 per cent., to other parts of the British Empire 2·4 per cent., to foreign countries 53·5 per cent.



The value of re-exports in 1945 to the United Kingdom was £2,330, to other parts of the British Empire £945, to foreign countries £78,071, as ships' stores £456,473.



The respective percentages for re-exports were: United Kingdom 0·43 per cent., other parts of the British Empire 0·17 per cent., foreign countries 14·5 per cent., ships' stores 84·9 per cent.



All the foregoing figures are exclusive of bullion and specie.



The total percentages of trade compared with the whole import and export trade of the Island (imports, domestic exports and re-exports), for the respective destinations are as follows:



| Per cent. |

|-----------|

| United Kingdom | 45·76 |

| Other parts of the British Empire | 18·94 |

| Foreign countries | 30·54 |

| Ships' stores | 4·76 |



**REVENUE**



The most important sources of revenue are the customs duties, licences, stamp duties, succession and donation duties, fees of office and reimbursements, post office, water and electricity receipts, and land revenue, interest, and Public Lotto profit.
