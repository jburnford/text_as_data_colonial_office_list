HONG KONG

Civil Administration under a Governor (Sir Mark Young, G.C.M.G.) was not restored in Hong Kong until the 1st May, 1946; and it is regretted that the inclusion in this edition of the Colonial Office List of up-to-date descriptive matter regarding the Colony has not been possible owing to the fact that it was still under military administration when material was being prepared for publication. An up-to-date statement will, however, be included in the next edition. Information relating to the colony before the Japanese occupation will be found in pages 336 to 344 of the Dominions Office and Colonial Office List for 1940.
