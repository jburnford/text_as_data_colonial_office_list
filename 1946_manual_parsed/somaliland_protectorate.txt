SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE

In 1884 a protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali Coast, extending from Lahadu (Loyi-ada), half-way between Ras Jibuti and Zeilah, to the 49th meridian E. longitude. The boundary has been settled by agreements with France, Italy and King Menelik of Ethiopia. Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden, as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, and in 1905 to that of the Colonial Office. From June, 1940-April, 1941, the protectorate was under Italian occupation. It was reoccupied in April, 1941, and since then has been under British military administration.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION, HISTORY AND CLIMATE

The chief ports are Berbera and Zeilah. Area about 68,000 square miles.

The climate at the coast is trying for Europeans, but it is comparatively healthy in the interior, where an elevation of from 4,500 feet to 6,800 feet is reached.

The Haud waterless plains, the greater part of which lies to the south of the protectorate frontier, constitute the principal pastures of the country which are essential to the livelihood of the people whose chief source of wealth lies in their stock.

In the beginning of 1901, operations were commenced against a fanatical Somali leader, the Mullah Mohammed Abdullah, and a native levy with British officers penetrated into the Nogal valley. The Mullah was defeated at Somala and Ferdiddin, and was driven into Italian territory. The dervishes afterwards gathered together again, and a similar expedition, strengthened by the 2nd King's African Rifles (Yaos), was despatched in the summer of 1902, and again drove the Mullah into Italian territory with heavy loss, but met with a severe check in Italian territory at Erigo, on 6th October. The Mulah, however, retired as the result of this action still further into Italian territory, to Galadi.

Five months later a third expedition, comprising British and Boer M.I., Indian and African troops, with the main base at Obbia in Italian Somaliland, proceeded to Mudug, thence detaching a force to Galadi, which place was up till then the headquarters of the enemy. A force of 200 Yaos and Sikhs was overwhelmed at Gumburru in April, 1903, after a fight of the fiercest description. A column of 200 men was at the same time attacked at Daratoleh, whence it retired fighting to Bohotleh. In June the expedition fell back on the Berbera-Bohotleh lines of communication, and Lieut.-General Sir C. C. Egerton, K.C.B., was placed in command.

Reinforcements, increasing the force to 7,000 rifles, were despatched and placed in the field, and in January, 1904, 3,250 troops defeated 5,000 dervishes at Jidballi.

In March, 1905, an agreement was concluded between the Italian Government and the Mullah whereby peace was declared between the dervishes and the neighbouring tribes, both those subject to the Government of Italy and those under the protection of the British Government. The Mullah was given a port on the east coast, and was assigned certain territories within the Italian sphere of interest, beyond which he and his dervishes undertook not to encroach.

In the latter part of 1908, some unrest was caused by the unfriendly attitude of the Mullah, and during 1909 reinforcements were brought into the protectorate from East Africa, Uganda, Nyasaland and India.

Subsequently arrangements were made to arm the friendly tribes to enable them to defend themselves against attack, and in March, 1910, all troops were withdrawn from the interior; the 6th Battalion King's African Rifles was disbanded, and a policy of strict coastal concentration was adopted. This policy having disappointed expectations, a Camel Constabulary, 150 strong, was raised at the end of 1912 to check inter-tribal fighting, which by this time had assumed serious proportions. A measure of peace among the friendly tribes was quickly restored, but in August, 1913, the Constabulary, at a strength of 109 rank and file, encountered at Dulmadoba a raiding party of dervishes estimated at 2,000 rifles, and in the action which ensued, though heavy losses were inflicted on the enemy, the Constabulary sustained casualties amounting to 50 per cent. killed, including the Commandant. The force thereupon fell back on Sheikh, and reinforcements of Indian infantry were moved up from the coast. His Majesty's Government later decided to increase the forces of the protectorate in order to preserve the necessary grazing grounds of the friendlies from dervish attack, and to maintain peace among the tribes living in the west.

In November, 1914, military headquarters were established at Burao, 90 miles from the coast. At this time the dervishes were in occupation of the Ain valley, which is one of the principal grazing grounds of the friendlies.
Strong forts had been constructed by the Mullah at Jidali and Shimber Berris and these were used as forward bases for raids against our tribes. The position at Shimber Berris was accordingly attacked by the local troops, and after a stubborn resistance all the forts were finally captured and blown up. In 1914, the dervishes made serious raids and their aggressions went on during the first World war, but, early in 1920, operations against them were carried out by air attacks followed up by mounted forces with infantry supports. These operations were completely successful; the power of the dervishes was destroyed, and the Mullah became a fugitive in Ethiopian territory. He died there in 1921. Between 1923 and 1940 the condition of the country was peaceful, and as a result the stock wealth of the native population largely increased, while in the western areas the development of agriculture made great progress. A geological survey of the protectorate was made.

From June, 1932, to May, 1935, the officer appointed to administer the Government was designated Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief.

After the collapse of France and the entry of Italy into the war in June, 1940, it was apparent that no assistance could be expected from French Somaliland in the event of an Italian attack which materialised on 4th August when powerful forces invaded the protectorate from Ethiopia. In the face of overwhelming odds it was decided to evacuate the civil government, and this was completed by 17th August.

The Italian occupation was short-lived. The forces under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Cunningham in their advance from Kenya had broken Italian resistance in Somalia by the end of February, 1941, and by March were driving northwards in pursuit of the Italian forces, leaving British Somaliland on the right flank of their advance. On 21st March, 1941, an expeditionary force which had been concentrated at Aden, re-occupied the protectorate and came under control of Sir Alan Cunningham. The expeditionary force was commanded by Brigadier A. R. Chater, C.B.E., D.S.O., O.B.E., who was also appointed Military Governor. From this time the protectorate has been under military administration with the seat of government at Hargeisa.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Constitution of British Somaliland rests on the Somaliland Order in Council, 1929, as amended by the Somaliland Orders in Council, 1930, 1932, 1935, 1938, 1941 and 1946. There is no executive or legislative council, and the power of making ordinances is vested in the Governor, subject to the general and specific instructions of the Secretary of State.

**POPULATION**

No complete census has been taken, but the Somaliland population was estimated in 1937 at 344,700. More recently it has been thought to approximate to double this figure. No figures of non-natives are available.

The native population is almost entirely nomadic and periodic migration across the southern border into Ethiopia in search of grazing is a regular practice amongst many tribes and sections.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The protectorate is divided into six districts, each under the charge of a British district officer. The absence of any cohesion amongst the tribes themselves and their nomadic habits makes any form of administration through native authorities a matter of considerable difficulty. Where such authorities exist, all possible use is made of them, but, for the most part, paid Government native agents known as "Akils" are employed.

**RELIGION**

In religion, the Somali are Sunni Mohammedans. Although fanatical, the people in the interior are not very strict in their religious observances. On the coast the tribes are more strict probably owing partly to their being less nomadic than those of the interior and also by reason of their intercourse with Arabia.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Two units of currency are in force—the Indian rupee and the East African shilling. In each case subsidiary coinage and notes are in circulation. The introduction of the East African shilling arises from the expulsion of the Italians from East Africa and the fact that all the Somali territories are at present under a unified military administration directed by the G.O.C.-in-C., East Africa Command.

There are no banks in the protectorate, but Messrs Cowasjee, Dinshaw & Brothers, conduct some banking business.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There are no railways or waterways, but some 2,000 miles of road are open for wheeled traffic in the dry season. There is also a fairly considerable traffic, chiefly by dhow along the coast of Somaliland across to Aden and southern Arabia. Before the war there was a weekly steamship service between Berbera and Aden operated under contract by Messrs Cowajee, Dinshaw & Brothers. A bi-weekly air service between Aden, Addis Ababa and Asmara now calls at Hargeisa, thus connecting the protectorate with the main trunk air services.

Postal and telegraphic services are at present operated by the army authorities.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

With the re-occupation of the protectorate in 1941 it became necessary to make an entirely fresh start with health and education services. Hospital accommodation is now available or in the course of construction at the main centres of population and a dispensary service is contemplated to provide for the needs of the nomadic tribesmen. Progress has been made in the development of clinics for women and children.

Education, unpopular before the war, is now progressing and five Government schools are in operation, together with a primary school which also offers facilities for technical and adult training. There are a considerable number of Koran schools which receive grants from the Government.

The nomadic characteristics of the Somali tribes make little in the way of labour services possible.

Grants totalling £315,500 have been made to the Protectorate under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1940, since 1943.

Tanganyika Territory

Extent and Boundaries

The Tanganyika Territory consists of that portion of the former colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the colony, namely the territory of Ruanda-Urundi in the north-west, and the Kionga area, south of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Umba River on the north to the Rovuma River on the south, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands.

The northern boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of south latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Rubabu Peninsular), thence along the first parallel of south latitude until it meets the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River up stream to its junction with the Kakitumba River thence along the eastern boundary of the Belgian mandated territory of Ruanda-Urundi to a point on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika at approximately 4° 27' south latitude. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the median line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows in a southerly direction to the mouth of the Kalambo River at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland to the mouth of the Songwe River at the north end of Lake Nyasa. Thence it follows the shore of the lake, first in a northerly and then in a southerly direction, to a point on the eastern shore of the lake at approximately 11° 35' south latitude, thence the boundary runs in an easterly direction to the Rovuma River whose course it follows to the sea.

The total area of the Territory is 362,688 square miles which includes 19,982 square miles of water.

The island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

Climate

The climate of the Territory varies greatly according to the height above sea-level of the several districts. Roughly, four climatic zones can be distinguished, though even among these there are considerable local variations:—(i) the warm and rather damp coast region with its adjoining hinterland. Here, conditions are tropical, though not unpleasant except just before and during the rainy seasons, when the heat is trying and the atmosphere humid. The average yearly temperature is 78 degrees. (ii) The hot and moderately dry zone between the coast and the central plateau (300 feet—2,000 feet). This zone is characterised by low humidity of atmosphere, less rain, and a temperature rather lower but with greater daily and yearly variations. (iii) The hot and dry zone of the central plateau between 2,000 feet and 4,000 feet in height. The climate of this zone differs greatly in parts, but its prevailing characteristics are low humidity, little rainfall (at Tabora an annual average of 32 inches), a fairly high mean temperature, with great daily and yearly variations, sometimes exceeding 36° F. daily. The heat is dry, but not so trying to the European as the moist and steamy warmth of the coast, while the nights are invariably cold. (iv) The semi-temperate regions around the slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru, of the Usambara Highlands, the Ufipa Plateau, and the mountainous areas of the south-western area (5,000 feet—10,000 feet). Frosts occur at the higher altitudes and the nights are cold.
districts enjoy a bracing climate, and alone can be considered healthy for Europeans, but prolonged residence in these altitudes is apt to produce nervous strain, even though physical fitness is maintained. There are two well defined rainy seasons annually. Generally speaking, the long rains begin in February or March, and last for two or three months, while the short rainy season extends from October to November, but the rainfall is low for a tropical country, and droughts are not infrequent.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,534 feet, Nyasa, 1,568 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 61,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mbeya, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway; Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,565 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,997 feet). In the south-west is the Kipengere Range where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz., the southern portion of Lake Victoria and the eastern portion of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

**HISTORY AND CONSTITUTION**

Plentiful evidence exists of Arab traders having visited the Territory for several centuries and of their opening up the great slave route from Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. The British explorer, Burton, first entered the Territory in 1856, and was soon followed by Speke, Livingstone and Stanley.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made 12 treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilima Njaro and occupied Moshi on 13th March of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on 1st January, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in 1919 appointing an Administrator. The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on 25th September, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council. In 1921 the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ufipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

In 1920 draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain lays down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of states members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated 19th March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, 13 official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on 1st July, 1926.

A further Order in Council which came into operation on 23rd November, 1945, altered the constitution of the Council to consist of the Governor as President, 15 official members and not more than 14 unofficial members. The first African members of the Legislative Council—two in number—took their seats in Council on 3rd December, 1945.

In January, 1946, His Majesty's Government announced to the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations their intention of placing Tanganyika Territory under the international trusteeship system established by the United Nations Charter.

**EAST AFRICAN GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE**

An account of the standing conference of East African Governors and its constitution is given in the introduction to Part II.

**POPULATION**

The number of Europeans, including Polish and other refugees, in Tanganyika territory is approximately 16,112. There are also over 46,500 Asiatics, chiefly Indians, Arabs and Goans. The natives are estimated at 5,437,069. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other
Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important language is Swahili, which is a hybrid between Arabic and Persian and all sorts of African tongues. It is more or less spoken as a Lingua Franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but the majority of the coastal tribes and a few in the hinterland profess Mohammedanism.

The territory is divided into eight provinces as follows:

| Provinces | Capital     | Approx. Native Population |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------|
| Central   | Dodoma     | 556,486                  |
| Eastern   | Dar-es-Salaam | 649,941                |
| Iringa    | Mbeya      | 544,500                  |
| Lake      | Mwanza     | 1,599,993                |
| Southern  | Lindi      | 590,826                  |
| Northern  | Arusha     | 408,000                  |
| Tanga     | Tanga      | 382,323                  |
| Western   | Tabora     | 705,000                  |
| Totals    |            | 5,437,069                |

**ADMINISTRATION**

For the purposes of administration the territory is divided into eight provinces, each in charge of a provincial commissioner. Each province comprises a number of districts in charge of district commissioners. There are 40 such districts in the territory.

The form of native administration operating in Tanganyika is a system of local self-government commonly known as "Indirect Rule". Under this system the tribal units in the various districts are constituted native authorities by a Native Authority Ordinance. There are four classes of such authorities. The first is the chief native authority, the so-called paramount chief; he usually has less important chiefs under him, who are gazetted as subordinate to the chief native authority. The native treasury, in this class, is under the direct control of the paramount chief. Secondly, certain federations of chiefs are recognised as native authorities: each chief is the authority in his own unit and retains independent executive powers; but the members of the federation combine for certain purposes, principally to constitute a joint treasury and for the passing of rules and orders applicable throughout the federation. The third class is the tribal council, consisting of petty chiefs or headmen belonging to the same tribe and with a common treasury. Fourthly, there is the small chief or headman of a more or less isolated portion of a tribe in areas which recognise no wider political authority. Each is appointed a native authority with limited powers and a small treasury.

In addition to the general obligation to assist the central Government in maintaining order and preventing crime in the areas under their jurisdiction, native authorities may issue executive orders or rules on a variety of matters. They also act as agencies of the Government in the discharge of a number of its social activities.

The resources of the native treasuries consist in a rebate on the house and poll tax collected in their areas, native court fees and local dues such as ferry and market fees. In 1945 the estimated total revenue accruing to the treasuries from these and other sources amounted to £322,000. The total expenditure, including the amount spent on capital works financed from surplus balances, was £359,000. The surplus balances at the end of the year amounted to £337,000.

The native courts, which form an integral part of the system of local government described above, are constituted under a Native Courts Ordinance. They are given limited jurisdiction to try cases in which both parties are natives, in accordance with native law and custom. Their proceedings are subject to inspection by administrative officers who are also empowered to revise their decisions. Appeals lie to the executive authorities and not to the High Court. All fees and fines collected are paid into the native treasuries. In 1944, the latest year for which figures are available, these courts dealt with a total of 100,900 cases, of which 53,820 were civil cases and 47,080 were cases of a criminal nature.

The flexibility of the organisation of the native administration on both its executive and its judicial side has been preserved and its structure has not yet taken final shape. There has been a progressive integration of the traditional native institutions into the general administrative system, as is shown by the growing use of rules and orders issued by the native authorities to serve the purposes of government. At the present stage of development there is, not unnaturally, a marked inequality in the efficiency of the different native authorities, and the character of the native administrations as a whole may be said to depend largely on the extent of the supervision exercised.

**RELIGION**

The majority of the inhabitants of the Territory, are pagans. Common features among many tribal beliefs are a belief in a supreme being and in the possibility of communion with the spirits of the departed.

There is a large African Moslem population to be found chiefly in the coastal areas and in the up-country trading settlements. They are followers of the Sunni school.

Christian missions are active and numerous in the territory. It is estimated that Christian Africans now number at least 680,000, of whom some 433,000 are Roman Catholic. The principal Roman Catholic missions now operating in the territory are the White Fathers, the Society of the Holy Ghost, the Capuchin Fathers, the Swiss Benedictines, the Consolata Fathers and the Passionist Fathers.

The principal Protestant missions are the Universities Mission to Central Africa, the Church Missionary Society, the Moravian Mission and the Augustana Lutheran Mission.

Among the immigrant Indian population the majority are Hindus, Sikhs and Moslem Khoja Ismailias and Ithnashiris.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

The German Government and the Deutch Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft minted and issued silver rupees of the Indian standard and subsidiary coins. The silver coinage was redeemed at the rate of 2s. of East African currency to the rupee, was withdrawn from circulation and ceased to be legal tender as from 1st April, 1923.
The period of the redemption of the subsidiary nickel and copper coinage (hellers) expired on 15th August, 1925. It became necessary to redeem Indian silver coinage at the same rate and redemption was effected by 23rd July, 1921.

The only currency now recognised in the Territory is shillings and subsidiary coins and currency notes of the East African Currency Board.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), and the Banque du Congo Belge.

**Communications**

**Railways and Roads**

The Territory is served by two railways of metre gauge.

(1) The Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika (774½ miles), with a branch line from Manyoni (365 miles) to Singida (72 miles), and a branch line from Tabora (524 miles) to Mwanza (236 miles) on Lake Victoria.

(2) The Tanga or Northern Railway from Tanga via Moshi (219 miles) to Arusha (272 miles). From Kahe Junction (206 miles) a line links up with the Kenya and Uganda Railway at Voi. The Voi-Kahe line is run under the management of the Kenya and Uganda Railway.

Motor traffic is now possible over 16,000 miles of roads during the dry season.

**Steamships**

The ports of Lake Victoria are served by the steamers of the Kenya and Uganda Marine; those of Lake Nyasa by the Nyasaland Government steamers; and the Tanganyika Railways steamship "Liemba" and a smaller one, "Mwanza," together with a Belgian service, maintain communications on Lake Tanganyika.

The British steamer "Liemba" (late German s.s. "Goatzen," 794 and 388 tons gross and net respectively) was put into commission in 1927, and maintains a service to Mpulungu, in Northern Rhodesia, via Southern Lake ports.

The following are the steamship lines serving the coast of Tanganyika:

- To and from Europe and Cape ports:
  - Union Castle Mail Steamship Co., Ltd.

**Posts and Telegraphs**

The telegraph system comprises 3,839 miles of pole route with 12,145 miles of wire, and the number of offices, including railway telegraph offices and wireless offices, is 143. The principal offices are Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Lindi on the coast, Bukoba and Mwanza on Lake Victoria, Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika, Kilosa, Dodoma and Tabora on the Central Railway line, Moshi on the Kenya border and Iringa, Mbeya and Tukuyu in the South Western area.

Business of all classes is conducted at 25 offices.

The principal places in the Territory are connected by telegraph and the system forms a land line communication link between Kenya and Uganda to the north and Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa to the south. Communication with the Belgian Congo is obtained through a wireless station at Kigoma.

Dar-es-Salaam is connected by cable with Zanzibar whence communication with all parts of the world may be established.

The main telephone trunk service is between Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Mombasa and thence to Nairobi in Kenya Colony. Telephonic communication is available to most places in the Tanga and Northern Provinces. There are also trunk lines between Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro, Kilosa and Dodoma, and between Tabora and Mwanza.

A radio-telephone service is available from Dar-es-Salaam and Tabora to the United Kingdom via Nairobi on Saturdays only.

Letter and parcel mails to and from overseas countries are despatched as opportunity offers. Regular services have not yet been restored.

There are regular air mail services between the Territory and Great Britain and between the Territory and South Africa and intermediate countries. There are connections at Cairo for services to and from India, Australia and Far East countries and via Great Britain for European countries and America.

**Air Communications**

The following services calling at airports in Tanganyika are in operation or scheduled to be brought into operation in the near future.

**Long Distance.**—Bi-weekly Empire flying boat service between England and South Africa, calling at Dar-es-Salaam and Lindi, operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation. French military service weekly between Paris and Madagascar, calling at Dar-es-Salaam and Lindi.

Daily service between Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam via Mombasa, Tanga and Zanzibar, calling twice weekly in each direction at Moshi. Three weekly services between Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam via Moshi. Weekly service between Dar-es-Salaam and Mbeya via Morogoro, Nduli, Southern Highlands Club and Chunya.

**Social Services**

**Medical Services**

Medical headquarters is located at the capital, Dar-es-Salaam. The administration of the department is carried on through seven provincial medical officers located as a rule at the provincial headquarters. Medical attention is given free
to the native population and to Government officials. There are 12 European hospitals and 50 native ones, which include the infectious diseases hospitals at Dar-es-Salaam and Tanga. Rural medicine is carried on through a chain of dispensaries, the larger number being financed from native treasury funds. There are 23 Government dispensaries and 321 Native Authority ones. Medical officers of health are maintained in the larger towns; in the smaller towns the duties fall upon the local medical officer. Specialist services are established at Dar-es-Salaam and include medicine, surgery and ophthalmology. A specialist in trypanosomiasis is stationed in the Western province. Dental surgeons are stationed at Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam.

Medical services are also maintained by many of the missions working in the territory, some of which have built excellent and well equipped hospitals. These are assisted by grants-in-aid from Government funds. The number of beds in Government hospitals is 3,422.

The Territory manufactures its own anti-smallpox lymph at Mwapwpa and supplies much to the adjoining territories. A central laboratory exists at Dar-es-Salaam and smaller ones at most of the provincial headquarter stations.

A medical officer has been seconded to the Labour Department as a specialist in industrial conditions and maintains liaison with that department.

Training of Africans for subordinate medical work, largely in connection with rural dispensaries, is carried on at Dar-es-Salaam, Mwanza and Tanga. African medical officers receive their training at Makerere in Uganda.

Further details are available in the annual reports of the Medical Department.

**European Education**

Three schools are maintained by Government for the primary education of European children, at Dar-es-Salaam, Arusha and Mbeya (the last two being boarding schools). A correspondence course, which also serves other East African territories, for children in the remoter districts, is conducted from Dar-es-Salaam. Assistance is given to eight privately maintained schools, one English, two Afrikaans, two Greek, one Goan (400 children) and two kindergarten schools. The total enrolment is approximately 1,200 pupils. For secondary education European children proceed to schools in Kenya. Bursaries are awarded for secondary education in Kenya and South Africa.

**Indian Education**

There are 82 Indian schools with a total enrolment of approximately 8,000 pupils. Grants-in-aid are paid in respect of staff, buildings and equipment. Seventy-three schools are on the grant-earning list. Instruction in the lower standards is conducted in Gujarati or Urdu, and in the higher standards in English. At the Government school in Dar-es-Salaam and at two other schools the curriculum is designed to take pupils to the Cambridge School Certificate examination.

**African Education**

Schools for Africans are provided by Government, the native administrations and voluntary societies, the two latter being subsidised by a grant-in-aid system controlled by the Education Department. Two hundred and twenty-two schools are maintained by Government or the native authorities, including seven secondary schools, nine teacher training centres and eight girls' schools. Primary schools are usually co-educational. The total enrolment is approximately 28,000 pupils. Assistance is given to 158 schools, including secondary schools, teacher training centres and girls' schools run by voluntary agencies. The total roll is approximately 46,000 pupils. In the secondary schools the medium of instruction is English. A few of the schools give a six-years' course at the end of which students may sit for the Makerere College, Uganda, entrance examination. After four years of the secondary course many students enter Government departments where they are given further technical instruction, and some proceed to the clerical course of two years at Tabora secondary school in which boys intended for the local civil service are taught office routine, accountancy, typewriting and shorthand. Two of the teacher training centres train Africans to teach in English in the lower classes of the secondary school; the remainder train vernacular speaking teachers for work in the primary schools. In the primary schools, stress is placed on the improvement of rural economy and nearly every village school has its garden. Industrial sections at the secondary schools teach carpentry, masonry, smithing and tailoring. The apprentice section of the Government printing press is attached to the Dar-es-Salaam school.

The total expenditure on Education in 1944 was £189,639 exclusive of further sums contributed by the native authorities and voluntary agencies.

The Government publishes a monthly journal in Swahili to disseminate news and useful information among the vernacular-speaking population.

**Education Department Staff**

The European staff of the Education Department includes a Director, Assistant Director, Education Officers, Headmasters, Masters, Senior Woman Education Officer, Women Education Officers, Headmistresses, Mistresses, Matrons, Supervisor Correspondence Course, Office Superintendent, Industrial Instructors, and Clerical Instructors.

The Indian staff comprises Headmasters, Inspectors, Assistant Masters, Office Assistant and Clerks.

There are 772 teachers, industrial instructors and clerks on the African establishment.

Further information is contained in the annual report of the Education Department, Tanganyika Territory, 1944.

**Labour**

The Labour Department consists of four divisions, labour, man power, civil re-absorption and training, of which the two latter were formed in 1945 to deal with the demobilisation of African soldiers. The Department is in the charge of the Labour Commissioner. The Labour Division has a staff comprising two Deputy Labour Commissioners, a Chief Factory Inspector, a Labour and Welfare Officer (Railways), 15 Labour Officers, an Electrical Engineer and a Medical Specialist, seconded from the Medical Department, but all these posts have not been filled. Labour Officers are posted at the following stations:

Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro, Tabora, Mbeya, Lindi, Tanga, Muheza, Korogwe, Arusha and Moshi.

The main employment areas are the Tanga province, that part of the Eastern province traversed by the Central Railway, the Arusha and Moshi districts in the Northern province, parts
of the Southern Highlands province and the coastal belt of the Lindi and Mikindani districts in the Southern province. In addition, several large mines in the Lake and Western provinces and in the Chunya district of the Southern Highlands province employ large labour forces. The Labour Division is responsible for the care of the African labour force in the territory which amounted to some 342,000 Africans in regular employment in 1945. In addition it maintains a chain of labour camps and shelters on the main labour routes for the use of Africans travelling to and from the main employment areas, and is opening labour exchanges at all the more important district headquarters with the object of placing skilled and semi-skilled persons, both ex-servicemen and civilians alike, in touch with potential employers.

The Man Power Division, the importance of which is now decreasing, has been responsible for military recruiting and the organisation of labour selected for employment in essential undertakings. It maintains recruiting depots at Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro, Dodoma, Tabora, Mwanza, Kigoma, Lindi and Arusha, the majority of which are in the charge of temporarily engaged European officers.

A staff of 21 civil dispersal officers, working under a principal Civil Dispersal Officer, seconded from the provincial administration, has been engaged for the Civil Reabsorption Division. The work of dispersal commences in Kenya, where six of these officers are employed, visiting the dispersal centres where the askaris are collected before they disperse to their homes in Tanganyika, and interviewing each man. Any queries which cannot be settled on the spot are referred to the appropriate military authority who forwards an answer direct to the district commissioner of the soldier concerned. The administrative staff, therefore, in the districts are saved much work and this system is proving satisfactory. The remaining 15 Civil Dispersal Officers are stationed in Tanganyika at the headquarters of those districts from which the largest numbers of soldiers were recruited, viz., Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro, Dodoma, Tabora, Nzega, Mwanza, North Mara, Arusha, Moshi, Tanga, Lindi, Songea, Tukuyu, Mbeya and Iringa, to assist district commissioners in the reception and payment of drafts and in their dispersal to their homes.

The Training Division is in the charge of the Director of Training, and its objects are to provide vocational training for ex-servicemen and to issue certificates of proficiency for skilled and semi-skilled trades. Besides contributing to an inter-territorial "A" Training Centre in Kenya, it is planned to operate "B" and "C" centres in Tanganyika. The "B" Centre is situated at Dar-es-Salaam where the technical trades will be taught and the training of rural artisans will be carried out, whilst the "C" Centre is near Morogoro and will provide clerical courses. "D" Centres will be established in certain provinces and will provide "improvement" courses for the less skilled artisan and trainee and "pools" of unemployed tradesmen capable of undertaking small constructional works. The "B" and "C" Centres will each be in charge of a principal who will have qualified European technical and professional staff to assist him, and the "D" Centres will be each under a European instructor. These centres were not in active operation by the end of 1945.

### Trade and Customs

Since 1923 the customs tariff of the Territory has been identical with that in force in Kenya and Uganda and provision was made for the duty-free interchange of all goods grown, produced or manufactured in any one of the three territories. In 1927 the customs management laws of the three territories were co-ordinated, and on 1st August, 1927, effect was given to an agreement under which all goods on which duty had been collected in one of the territories may be transferred to any of the other territories without further formality except the preparation of simple transfer forms, on which inter-territorial adjustments of revenue are subsequently arranged.

The tariff was revised in 1930, being enacted simultaneously in Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda. The basic fiscal rate is 20 per cent. ad valorem, assessed on the c.i.f. value of the goods including the cost of packing, delivery on board, freight, insurance and all other charges up to the time of importation into the Territory.

Full particulars of the trade of the Territory will be found in the annual trade report.
