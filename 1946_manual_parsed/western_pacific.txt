**Western Pacific High Commission**

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order-in-Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order-in-Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty’s Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised power. In 1893 a new Order-in-Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner’s jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order-in-Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony and the British Solomon Islands protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji is by virtue of his office a judicial commissioner.

Deputy commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner’s Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty’s civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years’ penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions, all decisions of the High Commissioner’s court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (including the Phoenix and Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY

The colony, which includes Ocean Island, the Line Islands (Christmas, Fanning and Washington), besides the Gilbert, Ellice and Phoenix Groups, is under the charge of a Resident Commissioner, who is responsible to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific who resides in Fiji.

The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following 16 islands—Makin, Butaritari, Marakei and Abaiang (Northern Gilberts); Tarawa, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Aranuka (Central Gilberts), Nonouti, Tabiteuea, Beru, Nikunau, Onotoa, Tamana, Aorae (Southern Gilberts).

The Ellice Islands are the following nine: Nanumea, Nanumaga, Niutao, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Niulakita.

The Phoenix Islands were annexed to the colony in March, 1937. They consist of Birnie, Canton, Enderbury, Gardner, Hull, McKean, Phoenix and Sydney Islands. An Anglo-American Condominium was established over Canton and Enderbury Islands in 1939.

The three groups above form a rough triangle, the approximate geographical positions of whose vertices are:—North (Gilbert Is.) 30° N., 173° E.; East (Phoenix Is.) 4° S., 171° W.; South (Ellice Is.) 11° S., 179° E.

The population of the colony as determined at the 1931 census was:—Ocean Island, 2,309; Gilbert Islands, 26,528; Ellice Islands, 4,074; Fanning, Washington and Christmas Islands, 505. The total of 33,416 comprised 275 Europeans, 32,467 natives, 235 half-castes and 439 Asiatics. An annual count is made of the population, but the figures obtained are not sufficiently accurate to be of value for comparative purposes.

With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate.

A revised code of native laws is validated by an ordinance of the colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race, those of the Gilbert Islands are termed Micronesians, while the Ellice Islanders are predominantly Polynesian with close affinity to the Samoans. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice groups.

Ocean Island (or Banaba), in latitude 0° 52' S., longitude 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. Reaching a height of 280 feet and covered with vegetation, it is the only island of the colony not of atoll formation. The population of Ocean Island on 31st December, 1938, was 2,744. This total included 140 Europeans, 684 Chinese, 888 Banabans and 1,032 Gilbert and Ellice Islanders (the majority of the latter being employed in the phosphate industry).

Fanning and Washington Islands lie about 30° 51' N. latitude and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. An Administrative Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean station of Cable & Wireless, Ltd., which is connected with all parts of the world by the company's system via Australia and via Canada. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel chartered by Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd. The population of Fanning Island at 31st December, 1938, was 195, that at Washington Island at the same time being 123.

Christmas Island (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles south-east by east of Fanning Island. The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. Under the terms of a licence dated 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations, Ltd., of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell, and guano during the term of 87 years from 1st January, 1914. All vessels employed or chartered by the company trading between the Society Islands and Christmas Island have been exempted from the Quarantine Ordinance, and may visit Christmas Island without a preliminary call at a prescribed port of entry in the colony. Periodical visits are made by H.M. ships. The population on 31st December, 1938, numbered 51. Since 1940 the coconut plantations have been operated by the colony Government.

PHOENIX GROUP

The Phoenix group comprises Phoenix, Birnie, Hull, Canton, Gardner, McKean, Enderbury and Sydney Islands, and is situated to the east of the Gilbert and Ellice groups. The islands are of coral formation and several of them are planted with coconuts. By an Order-in-Council dated 18th March, 1937, the boundaries of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony were extended to include the Phoenix group.

The islands were formerly leased to Messrs. Burns, Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd., for copra production, but the interests of that company were acquired in 1937 by the colony Government with a view to the islands being made available for settlement by the surplus population of the Gilbert Islands, and the three islands of Sydney, Hull and Gardner now carry a population of Gilbertese. In 1939 an Anglo-American joint regime was established over Canton and Enderbury Islands and Canton Island is now an important place of call on the transpacific air route.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work is undertaken and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. All the inhabited islands have native hospitals under the charge of native medical practitioners trained at the Central Medical School at Suva, or of native medical dressers trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

The principal sources of revenue are import duties, export duty on copra, land tax (paid in copra) on native communities, capitation tax £10 a head p.a. on non-natives, ship, trading and
other licences, royalty on phosphate shipped from Ocean Island, and consolidated payment by the British Phosphate Commissioners. By virtue of the last the Commissioners are exempted from certain taxation and duties.

From early in December, 1941, on the outbreak of war with Japan, and during the early months of 1942, Tarawa and Butaritari were raided at intervals by Japanese warships and Ocean Island was bombed by Japanese aircraft which also made occasional bombing raids on islands of the Gilbert group. All non-natives, with the exception of two Government officers (Cartwright, Administrative Officer, and Third, Wireless Officer), two British Phosphate Commissioners' representatives (Cole and Mercer) and two Sacred Heart Mission personnel (Father Pujebet and Brother Brummel), were evacuated from Ocean Island in the French destroyer "Triomphante" on 1st March, 1942. In August and September, 1942, Japanese Naval forces occupied Ocean Island and the Islands of Tarawa, Butaritari and Abemama, and visited all the other islands of the Gilbert Group and took away as prisoners of war a number of Europeans who had remained in these islands. All these Europeans, to the number of 22, were murdered by the Japanese at Tarawa in October, 1942. The six Europeans who remained in Ocean Island were brutally treated by the Japanese and were all dead within a few months of the enemy occupation of that island.

Although the enemy actually occupied only Ocean Island, Tarawa, Butaritari and Abemama, the activities of Japanese naval and air units effectually cut off all communication with the Gilbert Islands until November, 1943, when American forces, after heavy fighting at Tarawa, cleared the enemy from the group. Ocean Island remained in enemy hands until after the surrender of Japan and its re-occupation by Australian forces in October, 1945.

After their re-occupation in November, 1943, Tarawa and Butaritari were used as advanced bases for war operations against the enemy in the north-western Pacific. The Resident Commissioner and a number of other Government officers went in with the re-occupying forces to re-establish civil administration and for purposes of liaison between the American Command and the civil population. The whole of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands remained in military occupation and under military administration until after the surrender of Japan.

The Ellice Islands were not at any time under enemy occupation but were occupied by American forces during 1942, and advanced Military, Naval and Air bases were established at Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau. Patrolling enemy aircraft from the Gilbert Islands flew over frequently and made occasional bombing raids.

In the Phoenix Islands an American Military, Naval and Air base was established in Canton Island, which became of great importance on the transpacific air route for military aircraft. The island was shelled by an enemy submarine and subjected to occasional enemy air raids.

The Line Islands were free of enemy molestation during the war but were garrisoned by allied forces and under military administration.

During the period of allied occupation communication with the islands was maintained by military aircraft and by supply ships, but air communication has now ceased and the colony is dependent for its communications with the outside world (apart from wireless communication which has been re-established by the Administration), on small supply vessels operated by the Government.

Immediately upon the reoccupation of Ocean Island the British Phosphate Commissioners sent in men and material to commence the rehabilitation of the phosphate industry and expect to re-commence production during 1946.

The native population of Ocean Island, comprising some 900 Banabans and 1,200 Gilbertese, was deported by the Japanese during 1942 and 1943, some being sent to Nauru, some to the Caroline Islands and some to the Gilbert Islands, with the exception of some 150 able-bodied Gilbertese who were retained as labourers. These latter were brutally massacred by the Japanese in August, 1945, after the surrender of Japan.

The Banabans were collected in November and December, 1945, and, as their villages and means of sustenance in Ocean Island had been destroyed by the enemy, were transported to Rabi Island, in the Fiji group.

Since re-occupation the headquarters of the Colony Government has been temporarily at Tarawa. It is not proposed that colony headquarters should be re-established in Ocean Island, but that it should be permanently established in the Central Gilbert Islands atoll of Abemama.

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE

SITUATION AND AREA

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is situated between the parallels of 5° S., and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° E. longitude.

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands, extending at its extremities from Bougainville Straits to Mitre Island, in the Santa Cruz group, for a distance of 900 miles, and north and south from the Ontong Java group to Rennell Island for a distance of 430 miles, in an area approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,000 square miles are land.

HISTORY

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in the year 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. The island first sighted they named Ysabel because it was on that Saint's day that they left Callao. In the year 1595 a second expedition under Mendana sailed from Peru, but failed to locate the island of Guadalcanal, whereon it was intended he should form a settlement, and he arrived in the Santa Cruz group, and landed at Graciosa Bay. The new colony proved a failure, the death of Mendana put an end to any prospect of success, and the remnants of the original party returned to Peru.

In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the island of Malaita.

In the same year de Bougainville in the frigate La Boudoue, sailed from Monte Video on a deliberate quest of the Terra Australis which he missed, and arrived at New Guinea; in sailing back he passed through the Straits which are the present north-eastern boundary of the Protectorate, the island on the right being named Bougainville after him, and the one on the left named after Choiseul, who was at the time Minister of France.

Twenty years later, and 700 miles to the south-east, la Perouse, in command of the French frigates L'Astrolabe and La Boussole, on a voyage of discovery, was wrecked at P'iou on the island of Vanikoro. His fate was unknown for 40 years.

From this time many Europeans visited the group, and British ships-of-war paid periodical visits.

In 1860 natives were recruited to work on plantations in Queensland and Fiji. The recruiting for Queensland ceased in 1903 and most of the natives were repatriated.

Recruiting for Fiji continued until 1910.

Between the years 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the Southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristoval, the New Georgia Group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50.

In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tucopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona, were added to the protectorate, and in 1900 the northern islands, namely, Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits, south and south-east of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ontong Java, were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

Early in 1942 Japanese aircraft commenced bombing raids on the protectorate capital at Tulagi, and when enemy invasion became imminent in February and March the majority of the non-native population, including all Government officials who could be spared, were evacuated to Australia. The Resident Commissioner and a number of officers remained in the protectorate to continue the administration so far as possible, but evacuated Tulagi and other stations on the seashore and moved to various places in the interior of the larger islands. The Resident Commissioner, with a wireless officer equipped with a portable radio, moved to Malaita, whence he maintained communication with his officers and radio communication with Suva and other stations, collecting and passing out invaluable intelligence reports of enemy movements and activities until the landing of American forces later in the year.

During the early months of 1942 the enemy overran and occupied the western half of the protectorate as far as Guadalcanal, Nggela and Ysabel, and established a post on the north-western end of Malaita. In Guadalcanal the Japanese immediately commenced the construction of an airfield with the obvious intention of using it as an advanced base for the bombing of areas to the south and west.

In August, 1942, the American Marine Division landed in Tulagi and Guadalcanal, occupied the Japanese airfield (later developed into the Henderson airfield) and, after some months of stiff fighting, drove the enemy out of the central portion of the protectorate. On the arrival of the American forces the Resident Commissioner established contact with the commander and the administration thereafter operated as a military administration under the control of the military commander.

During 1943 the enemy was dislodged from the western end of the protectorate, with the exception of the small Shortland group and the north-western tip of the large island of Choiseul which remained in enemy hands until the surrender of Japan.

The economy of the protectorate is based almost wholly on the copra industry and the greater part of the copra exported before the war was produced on coconut plantations owned and operated by Europeans. On the retirement early in 1942 of the non-native population before the Japanese invasion the plantations were necessarily abandoned, and, with the rapid tropical growth of underbrush during four years of neglect, have deteriorated greatly; and this, combined with the severe damage caused by war operations, has reduced the potential of copra production by at least 50 per cent. since 1941, when it stood at about 24,000 tons per annum. Due to the extreme scarcity of shipping since the war ended, it has not been possible to provide an oversea shipping service to the protectorate and consequently European planters are not able to re-occupy their plantations and re-commence copra production.

Since communication by military aircraft ceased on the withdrawal of the Allied occupation forces after the termination of the war, the protectorate has had to rely, for its oversea shipping communications, almost entirely upon one small vessel of some 288 tons operated under charter by the protectorate Government. Arrangements are now in hand for the purchase of this vessel outright.
Apart from the Allied forces engaged in local war operations, large bases were established in the protectorate for operations further afield; and consequently very large Allied forces were in occupation or temporarily quartered in the group. The effect upon the native population of contact with such large numbers of Allied servicemen was necessarily great and far-reaching and a certain disruption of native life and change in outlook was inevitable. It is yet too early to say to what extent these effects will have made a permanent impression upon the natives; but they are being felt in many directions and are likely to have an important bearing on the resumption of the normal economic life of the protectorate.

An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory has been the great loyalty of the native people to their British connection and to the Allied cause generally.

**Population (in 1937)**

- Europeans: 478
- Native (Melanesian): 89,568
- Native (Polynesian): 3,847
- Chinese: 192
- Japanese: 8
- Malays: 1
- Total: 94,094

**Climate**

The climate of the Solomon Islands, owing to the prevalence of malaria, is not healthy, but the conditions of living have been greatly improved during recent years and the possibilities of good health during temporary residence have been enormously increased.

Generally speaking, the seasons are well defined by the trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the lowest minimum temperature is recorded, and the highest mean and maximum temperatures are, as a rule, recorded in the months from November to April which is commonly known as the north-west season.

The rainfall varies considerably from month to month and year to year, though the average rainfall, recorded at Tulagi, is approximately 120 inches a year.

**Administration**

The British Solomon Islands protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed at Honiara in Guadalcanal) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific (who resides in Suva, Fiji).

There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of King’s Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893.

There is an Advisory Council, consisting of the Resident Commissioner and not more than seven members, three of whom may be officials.

**Customs and Trade**

The customs tariff consists of duties at specific or *ad valorem* rates on certain imports and exports and includes provisions for Empire preferences.

TONGA

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, area about 250 square miles, situated between 18° and 22° south latitude, were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most are of coral formation, but some are volcanic. The Tongans are Polynesians, closely allied to the Maoris and Samoans. The islands are in three main groups, Vava'u, Ha'apai, and Tongatapu (containing the capital, Nuku'alofa). In the late 18th and early 19th centuries there was fierce civil war between the three groups, and not until 1845 did King George Tupou I succeed in uniting the whole of Tonga. The centenary of the unified kingdom was celebrated on 4th December, 1945.

King George Tupou I, who died in 1893, was succeeded by his great-grandson George Tupou II, on whose death in 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter, succeeded. The Queen, who was born in 1900, married the late Prince Uiliami Tungi, who died in 1941.

Queen Salote Tupou was made an Honorary G.B.E. on the occasion of the centenary in 1945. Her heir is her elder son, Tungi, B.A., LL.B. Sydney), who was born in 1919.

CLIMATE

The climate is healthy. Although hot and humid from January to March, it is pleasantly cool during most of the remaining months. The temperature ranges from 53° to 93° F. The average annual rainfall varies between 70 inches in Tongatapu and 110 in Vava'u.

HISTORY

Much of the history of Fiji since the year 1826, when the first Wesleyan missionaries landed in Tonga, has been concerned with the relationship between Church and State. By the middle of the century practically all the chiefs and people had embraced Christianity, the great majority being Wesleyans. The control and management of the Wesleyan Mission remained with the Australasian Conference until 1885, when King George Tupou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded. Assisted by the Rev. Shirley Baker, originally a Wesleyan missionary, then also Premier, the King established the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga as an independent body. In 1887 an attempt by some escaped native convicts on the Premier's life was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos" or members of the original Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100 were deported to Fiji. At an enquiry by the High Commissioner the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaogo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the King, was addressed to the High Commissioner, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the mission church at once recommenced.

In 1890 further complaints were made; and Tongan officials denied that the King had promised to accord freedom of worship. Finding, after further inquiry, that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the trouble, Sir John Thurston prohibited him from being within the group for a term of two years. A few days earlier the King, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh government was formed with a Tongan Premier, Tukuaho. Under the new government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled.

In 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church and, after an enquiry into the state of the finances, it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies. At a joint conference union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. B. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued in respect of the ownership of the property of the church established by King George Tupou I, which was finally decided in favour of the United Church, now known as the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, of which the present Queen is the head.

CONSTITUTION

The present constitution was granted in 1875, although it has since been amended. It provides for a Government consisting of the Sovereign, a Privy Council and Cabinet, a Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary.

The Sovereign presides over the Privy Council, which consists of the Premier, the Ministers (at present three Tongans and one European, who are also heads of government departments), and the Governors of Vava'u and Ha'apai when they are at headquarters. The constitution of the Cabinet is similar, except that the Premier and not the Sovereign presides. The Legislative Assembly consists of the Premier and Ministers of the Crown (including the two Governors), seven representatives of the nobles elected by the nobles themselves, and seven representatives of the people elected by popular franchise, every male Tongan of 21 years of age who pays taxes and can read and write being qualified to vote. Elections for both the nobles and the representatives of the people are held every three years. The President of the Legislative Assembly is the Speaker, appointed by the Sovereign. The courts consist of a Supreme Court, a magistrate's court and a land court. British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for over two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the court of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

Tonga is a self-governing protectorate under the protection of Great Britain, established by a Treaty of Friendship and Protection signed in 1900.

The following are the official estimates of population as at 31st December, 1945:

| Description                  | Population |
|------------------------------|------------|

| **Total**                    | **40,668** |

A census will be held in 1947.

RELIGION

There are seven missions in Tonga:—The Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, about 20,700 adherents; Free Church of Tonga and Church of Tonga (off-shoots of the Wesleyan Church), about 11,250; Roman Catholics, 5,900; Church of England, 270; Church of Latter Day Saints, 2,060; Seventh-Day Adventists, 330.
Currency and Banking

There has been a Government note issue since 1919, denominations being £5, £1, 10s. and 4s. The amount of notes in circulation on 30th June, 1945, was £70,231. Tongan currency is at present at a discount of 25 per cent. on sterling. United Kingdom, Australian, New Zealand and Fiji silver and copper coinage are legal tender.

There are no private banks in the kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1945 there were some 2,800 depositors and £100,748 in deposits.

Communications

There is a monthly steamship service from New Zealand via Fiji, and vessels call at regular intervals to load copra for the United Kingdom.

There are about 200 miles of roads in the group, but a proportion of this mileage consists of earth roads which are only usable by motor traffic in dry weather.

There is a first-class aerodrome on the island of Tongatapu, large enough to take the largest aircraft, and seaplane facilities at Nuku'alofa harbour.

There are five wireless stations in the group and a telephone service in Nuku'alofa.

Social Services

There are both Government and Mission primary schools, primary education in Tonga being compulsory between the ages of six and 14 years. There are one Government and four Mission colleges for boys, at each of which provision is made for secondary education. The secondary education of girls is in the hands of the missions. The Tongans are entirely literate.

There are three public hospitals, the main one being at Nuku'alofa, where the Chief Medical Officer is in charge. There are 14 Tongan medical practitioners, trained at the Central Medical School in Fiji, stationed at various islands throughout the group.

Every male Tongan on reaching the taxable age of 16 years is entitled to 81 acres of land for cultivation in addition to a small village allotment for his dwelling. For these two allotments he pays a tax of 8s. a year. He pays also an annual tax of 32s. for which free education, medical, hospital and dental treatment are provided.

Finance and Trade

| Year       | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Pre-war—   |             |                 |
| 1937–38    | 69,241      | 62,742          |
| 1938–39    | 60,441      | 69,612          |
| War—       |             |                 |
| 1942–43    | 116,180     | 99,375          |

| 1944–45    | 140,334     | 106,997         |

The chief exports are copra and bananas, the average annual export of copra being about 12,000 tons and of bananas about 80,000 cases. All copra is now shipped to the United Kingdom, the bananas to New Zealand.

There is no public debt, and the amount of accumulated balances on 30th June, 1946, was £216,000.

The main source of revenue is customs duties. In addition to a number of specific duties there is a general tariff of 3¾ per cent. ad valorem and a British preferential tariff of 15 per cent. ad valorem.

The New Hebrides

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 square miles. The non-native population is about 3,000 and the native is estimated at 40,000.

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, Seventh Day Adventists and Church of Christ, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia and by the Roman Catholic Church.

The principal exports are copra, cocoa, coffee, trochas; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on 2nd December, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol, drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on 18th March, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers, have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium staff working in departments under the joint control of the two resident commissioners.

The customs tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.
On the import trade of the group about 49 per cent. is claimed by Australia, 26 per cent. by France, and the remainder by Britain, Japan, China and U.S.A., while the bulk of the exports are shipped to France.

**PITCAIRN ISLAND**

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (latitude 25°3′ S., longitude 130°8′ W.). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. Bounty, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island’s resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population (at 30th June, 1936) numbered 202 persons.

It is a British colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the West Pacific in 1898 under section 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

Chief Magistrate—Norris Young.

The Government is now administered under the High Commissioner, by a Council consisting of a chief magistrate, two assessors, a secretary and a chairman of the internal committee. These officers are elected annually by the people.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
