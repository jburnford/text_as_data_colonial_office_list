BARBADOS

SITUATION AND AREA

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' N. and longitude 59° 37' W., and is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

CLIMATE

Owing to the easterly trade winds which blow almost continuously from December to June the climate is bracing and the heat is never oppressive. During the remainder of the year, the wet season for the island, the heat is seldom excessive although the absence of the trade winds renders the climate less invigorating. The average temperature is 79-8° F.

Though the island is small there is considerable variation in rainfall: in the high central areas the average rainfall is 75 inches while in some of the low lying districts in the south of the island it is no more than 50 inches.

The island is largely visited as a health resort by residents of neighbouring West Indian colonies and British Guiana and is a popular winter resort for visitors from temperate climates. It is also a port of call for tourist steamers.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The land rises in terraces from the coast to a ridge near the centre of the island, the highest point being Mt. Hillaby (1,100 feet). The main characteristic of the island is the intense sugar cultivation; all available land is utilised and, due to the almost complete absence of forest and waste land, the general appearance is reminiscent of the English countryside. In the north-west—the Scotland district—the watershed is nearer to the coast and the descent to the sea is consequently steeper. The scenery, too, is more rugged and picturesque, and there is some erosion.

With the exception of the Scotland district, which is of volcanic origin, the island is of coral formation. Coral limestone covers the greater part of the island and coral reefs, which in some parts extend more than two miles out to sea, almost encircle it. The soils overlying the coral limestone, although divided into several types, are all suitable for good sugar cane cultivation, though heavy application of artificial manures is necessary to maintain fertility.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the south-west of the island on Carlisle Bay. This bay is an open roadstead sheltered from the prevailing winds and is available for all classes of vessels. There is in addition an inner harbour or careenage where schooners and vessels of lighter tonnage are moored.

The island is fortunate in having excellent bathing, though on the windward coast the sea is apt to be rough.

HISTORY

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who found it uninhabited and rude in appearance, and named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig trees. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive Blossom in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1626 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some 30 persons, landed in February, 1627, on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their Governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Caribbean Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of £300. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 64 settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island: and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary
government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in the possession of Great Britain.

**CONSTITUTION**

The colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Secretary of State for the Colonies retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is nominated by the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of the Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of 10 members appointed by His Majesty, and a House of Assembly, consisting of 24 members (two for each parish and two for the City of Bridgetown) elected for a period of two years. In 1944 the income qualification for voters was reduced from £50 to £20 a year, and the franchise was given to females, who also became eligible for election as members. The number of registered electors in 1945 was 15,846 as compared with 7,394 in 1943. The executive part of the Government is vested in the Governor and an Executive Council and, in respect of certain matters, an Executive Committee. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary and Attorney General *ex officio*, and of such other persons as His Majesty may appoint. The Executive Committee, which is created by local statute, consists of the Executive Council *ex officio* and of one member of the Legislative Council and four members of the House of Assembly appointed by the Governor at the commencement of each session of the Legislature. The Executive Committee introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates and initiates all Government measures; it is also responsible for the conduct of public works, and the control and management of Government property. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada and Tobago, but in 1885, by Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands and made a distinct Government.

**POPULATION**

The population of the island in 1851 was 135,939. Thereafter a census was taken in every tenth year, except 1901, until 1921. The population increased steadily between 1851 and 1891 in which year it was returned as 182,306. In 1911 the census figure was 171,983, and in 1921 it was 156,512. The decrease is attributed to the large scale emigration of labourers, particularly to Panama in connection with the canal works. No census has been taken since 1921 but there has undoubtedly been a steady increase in the population which is now estimated (from figures obtained in connection with rationing) at approximately 203,500.

The population consists of persons of African descent, persons of European descent, and persons of mixed African and European descent. In 1921 persons of European descent represented 6·7 per cent. of the population; the percentage today is probably smaller.

English is spoken universally.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The island is administered as one unit except in respect of local government matters, which are in the hands of the vestries and parochial boards of the 11 parishes. The vestries are elected annually, and each vestry appoints commissioners of highways, commissioners of health and poor law guardians for the parish. The two last-named bodies rely for revenue upon grants from the vestry, but the commissioners of highways, who are responsible for the upkeep of all public highways in the parish which are not maintained by the Central Government, collect all vehicle and highway taxes and in addition receive grants-in-aid from the Central Government. The vestries derive their revenue mainly from taxes on ownership and occupancy of land and houses and trade tax; the rates for these are fixed annually so as to bring in sufficient revenue to meet the estimated expenditure for the year. The vestries undertake the repair and maintenance of churches and church buildings and the rector of each parish is chairman of the vestry *ex officio*.

**RELIGION**

The population is almost wholly Christian, and the Anglican Church, the membership of which comprises approximately 70 per cent. of the population, is the established church. The Anglican clergy receive their salaries from Government funds and are eligible for pensions under the Pension Act. The maintenance and repair of churches and church property is the responsibility of the vestries, which are authorised to lay rates for the purpose.

Next in size after the Anglican Church are the Methodist and Moravian Churches, both of which have been long established in the island. The number of Roman Catholics is comparatively small. In addition to these there are branches of the Salvation Army and of many denominations of modern growth.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Government accounts are kept in sterling; commercial accounts in West Indian dollars (£1 = $4.80). Currency notes issued by the Government in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $20 and $100 are legal tender, as also are notes issued by the Governments of British Guiana and Trinidad. There is no local issue of coin, but United Kingdom coin is used, silver being legal tender in any amount.

There are three banks doing business in Barbados:

- Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), paid up capital, £4,975,500.
- Royal Bank of Canada, paid up capital, $35,000,000.
- Canadian Bank of Commerce, paid up capital, $30,000,000.

There is also a Government Savings Bank. On the 30th June, 1945, the bank had 31,771 depositors and the total amount at credit of depositors was £1,836,345.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Air and Sea Communications**

There is a landing ground with a 5,000 feet hard surfaced runway at Seawell in the south-eastern part of the island. British West Indian Airways, Ltd., provides regular air services to Trinidad, British Guiana and Jamaica and to most of the Windward and Leeward Islands.
Regular steamship services were disrupted as a result of the war and have not yet been resumed. The principal lines operating at the end of 1945 were the Harrison Line to the United Kingdom and the Alcoa Line and Canadian National Steamships to North America. Barbados is the headquarters of the schooner trade in the Eastern Caribbean.

**Roads and Road Transport**

The office of Director of Highways and Transport was created in 1945 and the Director was made responsible for the duties hitherto performed by two statutory boards—the Central Road Board and the Transport Board. He is assisted by an advisory committee of four members appointed by the Governor.

There are 549 miles of road open for traffic; 291 miles are maintained by the Director of Highways and Transport and the remainder by the parochial authorities.

The Director also exercises a general control over public service vehicles, and in particular over omnibuses, which may operate only on such routes and in accordance with such time tables as he approves.

**Telecommunications**

External telecommunication services are operated by:

(1) Cable and Wireless (West Indies), Limited, controlled by Cable and Wireless, Limited. This company owns and operates cable connections with most of the other more important West Indian islands and British Guiana, and through Turks Island and Bermuda to Halifax, where connection is made with the company’s North Atlantic cable system to Great Britain and other parts of the world.

The company has also recently established in the island large long range wireless installations which, with its previously established wireless coast station, are operated in conjunction with the cable system and provide services with many parts of the world and with a number of the other West Indian islands which are not connected by cable. The coast station also provides a service with ships at sea.

In 1945 the company, in collaboration with the Barbados Telephone Company, Limited, inaugurated wireless telephone services with Canada, the U.S.A., Jamaica, British Guiana, Trinidad, and several of the other West Indian islands.

(2) The Western Telegraph Company, Limited, also controlled by Cable and Wireless, Limited, with direct cable communication with Brazil and South America generally.

(3) The Western Union Telegraph Company, with cable connection to Miami, operated in conjunction with the Western Telegraph Company, Limited.

Each parish maintains its own almshouses and employs a parochial medical officer.

The only general hospital is the Barbados General Hospital which has accommodation for 30 paying patients and 256 non-paying patients. The hospital is administered by a statutory board, most of the members of which are appointed by the Legislature. The hospital receives an annual grant from the Government based on its estimated expenditure.

The Government maintains a mental hospital (accommodation for 248 males and 326 females) and a leper hospital, of which the number of inmates at the end of 1945 was 49.

Labour.—A Labour Department under a Labour Commissioner was established in 1940. Its establishment was followed by the formation in 1941 of the first trades union in Barbados, the Barbados Workers’ Union. The introduction at this time of the principles and methods of collective bargaining has resulted in a steady improvement in the field of industrial relations, and it is now the normal practice for disputes relating to wage rates and conditions of service to be discussed by conciliation boards sitting under the chairmanship of the Labour Commissioner.

In March, 1945, the Barbados Workers’ Union consisted of 22 active trade divisions with a membership of 5,587. Agricultural workers were slower in organising and there is still no union fully representative of this branch of labour. The value of trade unions is, however, becoming increasingly appreciated and during the second half of 1945 five new unions registered: two of these, the Shipping and Mercantile Association and the Sugar Producers’ Federation, are unions of employers; the other three, the Clerks’ Union, the Overseers’ Association and the Congress Trade Union, are unions of workers.

The last seven years have seen the enactment of a considerable amount of legislation relating to labour; among the more important measures are acts dealing with the recruiting of workers, trade disputes, trade unions, workmen’s compensation, wages boards and the hours and conditions of employment of shop assistants.

Between June, 1941, and December, 1945, 11,200 workers left the colony on temporary emigration schemes sponsored by the Labour Department; the majority went to the U.S.A. to work in industry and agriculture, and the amounts which they saved from their earnings have improved the social and economic condition of a large number of families.

Social Welfare.—In 1943 the Government created the posts of Social Welfare Officer and Assistant Social Welfare Officer. In the same year Barbados Welfare Limited was incorporated and registered as a non-profit making company, its object being to help groups of people to cooperate in raising their standard of living by economic, cultural and recreational activities. The Social Welfare Officer is a member of the board of directors. The company has directed its activities to assistance in the provision of playing fields, the development of cottage industries and other minor industries on a co-operative basis, and the promotion of youth organisations. A subsidiary company has been formed to manufacture salt on a co-operative basis; progress has been made in the formation of clubs and women’s institutes, and the provision of playing fields, and organisers are employed to teach cottage handicrafts and to organise co-operative community efforts.
There are also a number of other voluntary bodies working in the social welfare field.

(Note.—Further particulars of these services will be found in the Annual Departmental Reports.)

**Bermuda**

**Situation and Area**

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group of about 300 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean in latitude 32° 15' N. and longitude 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730, from New York 677 and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles.

The total area is estimated at about 21 square miles as compared with 19 square miles prior to the establishment of naval and military bases by the Government of the United States. Between 1941 and 1943 certain islands were joined and other areas, previously water covered, were filled in and now form a part of the territory occupied by the United States bases, including a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.
CLIMATE

The climate has long been celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The mean monthly temperature in 1944 was 70°5°F., the minimum recorded being 49°8°F in March and the maximum 90°4°F in August. The mean relative humidity was 77, the most humid month being June when it reached 86. The rainfall in 1944 was 54°78 inches and was fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The summer heat is usually tempered by a pleasant sea breeze.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Bermudas, of which a good account will be found in the narrative of the voyage of the Challenger, may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sandhills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 3 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. The largest island, generally known as the Main Island, is about 14 miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands and areas reclaimed for the United States bases aggregate about 4,280 acres. The city of Hamilton, now the seat of government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the vessels which carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of government to Hamilton is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, entirely given up for the accommodation of His Majesty’s dockyard and a number of other naval establishments; Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, and now exclusively occupied by military depots and garrisons; Somerset, Smith’s, Nonsuch, Ports and Godets—all inhabited by a civil population.

A part of St. David’s Island is now occupied by the United States army, necessitating the rehabilitation of a number of persons who previously resided on what is known as leased territory. The Bermuda airport, used by seaplanes, is situated on Darrell’s Island. The islands form an almost continuous chain, and there is uninterrupted communication by railway, road, bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset, and over Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island, a distance of about 22 miles.

HISTORY

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, after whom they were called “The Bermudas.” The Spaniards, however, took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers’ ship The Sea Venture, while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the admiral’s ship, “The Sea Venture Flat.”

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudez, called the group after him “The Somers’ Islands.” The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land, taken home by Somers’ nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I, but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called “The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands,” and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers.

CONSTITUTION

Representative government was introduced into the colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the governors have always been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, consisting of four official and three unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 2,913 electors, the electoral qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240. The members of the Executive Council and the Legislature are paid at the rate of 16s. for each day’s attendance.

With the enactment of the Women’s Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

POPULATION

The total population, excluding naval, military and air force personnel, is estimated at 33,500, of whom approximately 10,000 are of English descent, 2,500 Portuguese (employed mainly in agriculture) and 21,000 of the negro race. English is universally spoken.

Population of city of Hamilton, 3,000 (approximately); town of St. George's, 1,300 (approximately).

ADMINISTRATION

Hamilton and St. George's have been incorporated as municipalities since 1793 and 1797 respectively and there are nine parish vestries, all the members of which, as well as the two municipal corporations, are elected annually.

The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 12s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property.

The corporation of St. George obtains its revenue in a like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100.

Both corporations are local boards of health in their respective districts.

The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy parish rates, a further source of income being obtained under the Liquor License Act, licensees paying a certain annual sum which varies according to the class of license held.

RELIGION

All denominations are fully represented throughout the colony, there being 44 places of worship, as follows:

- Church of England, 15; Church of Scotland, 1; Presbyterian, 1; Wesleyan Methodist, 12; Roman Catholic, 5; and African Methodist Episcopal, 10.

There is accommodation for 13,000 persons in the various churches.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The coins in circulation are British currency which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £706,602 were in circulation on 31st December, 1945. There are two incorporated banks, the Bank of Bermuda, Ltd., and the Bank of N. T. Butterfield & Son, Ltd. A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and there are branches at Hamilton, St. George's and Sandys parish. The total number of depositors at the end of 1945 was 7,400, the total deposits being £156,802 during that year.

COMMUNICATIONS

Postal

Letters from England usually take between five and seven days by air-mail, surface mail being uncertain at present, but nine to twelve days was the average pre-war time for this method of conveyance. Postage rates are:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| Within the colony, per oz. 1½d. | ¼d. per 2 oz. |
| To U.K., Dominions, India, Colonies and Protectorates, per oz. 2½d. | ¼d. per 2 oz. |
| To all other countries, per oz. 3d. | ¼d. per 2 oz. |

Letters, Air-Mail

To U.K. (Air-letter forms) ... 6d.
To U.K., per ½ oz. ... 1s. 9d.
To United States and Canada, per ½ oz. 7½d.
To other countries, from 1s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. according to destination.

Parcel Post

To U.K., 1 lb. to 3 lb., 2s. 6d.; 3 lb. to 7 lb., 6s.; 7 lb. to 11 lb., 9s. 3d.

Railway, Roads and Ferries

A Government-owned light railway is in operation between St. George's and Somerset. There are approximately 105 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads. Between Somerset and Hamilton there is a regular ferry service which also connects Hamilton with the parishes of Paget and Warwick.

Road Transportation

Legislation providing for the operation of motor vehicles on the highways of the Colony was finally enacted in August, 1946, and, with certain limitations covering size, horse power and speed, motor cars, taxis, buses, trucks and auto-bicycles may now be used.

Private motor cars and taxis must not exceed the following specifications:—Horse power, 10; overall length, 160 in.; and overall width, 64 in.

No person may use a motor car which, at the time of its importation, was second-hand.

Annual licence fees are assessed at the rate of £2 per horse power.

Prior to 1939, the use of motor vehicles, with the exception of those operated in connection with certain essential services, was prohibited, but during the war the necessity arose for an all-round speed up of communications and a number of vehicles were allowed on the roads.

During this time Bermuda became conscious of the advantages to be gained by allowing the general use of motorised transport and, in addition to private cars and taxis, plans are now being made for an efficient bus service to link up all parts of the Colony.

Air

British Overseas Airways Corporation and Pan American Airways maintain a regular service between Bermuda and the United States.

Shipping

Before the war, communication between Bermuda and the United Kingdom was maintained by vessels of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., which made regular calls at Bermuda every month outward and homeward. This service has been disrupted during the past six years but will, no doubt, be resumed later.

Prior to September, 1939, communication between Bermuda and New York was provided by the palatial Monarch of Bermuda and Queen of Bermuda which made bi-weekly sailings. These two vessels were withdrawn at the outbreak of war but the Furness-Bermuda Line has recently started a regular passenger service with ships of smaller capacity. The Monarch and Queen will resume their trips after being reconditioned. There is a regular freight service between Canadian and American ports and the colony.

Cables and Wireless, Etc.

Cable & Wireless (West Indies), Limited, a subsidiary of Cable & Wireless Limited of London, operate the overseas telegraph and telephone communications systems in Bermuda.

A direct cable to Halifax, N.S., forms an undersea link with North America, etc., and a relay point with Great Britain and countries beyond.
With a southerly cable landing at Turks Island and from thence to Jamaica in one direction and Barbados in the other, the West Indies and general Caribbean area is well served.

Wireless telegraph circuits are also maintained with the R.C.A. and Mackay Radio systems in New York.

The wireless transmitting station situated at St. George, and its receiving counterpart at Store Hill, provide the community with adequate radio facilities.

A ship-to-shore telegraph service is available and doubtless this will be extended before long to telephony with certain equipped vessels, in conformity with pre-war arrangements.

Medium and short wave direction-finding bearings are available upon request.

A radio-telephone circuit is operated with New York, which puts the community in telephonic communication with all parts of the U.S.A., Canada, and numerous other countries.

A recent development of this aspect of the company's operations is the establishment of a direct radio-telephone circuit with London, thus giving instantaneous service with the United Kingdom.

The company is also under contract with the Air Ministry and Bermuda Government to provide all types of radio services required in connection with the operation of the Bermuda airport and general civil aeronautical services.

The privately-owned Bermuda Telephone Company has 2,600 subscribers with about 26,500 miles of wire, a large portion of which is in underground cables.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Health

The level of health in the colony is high and is safeguarded by the General Board of Health with a senior medical officer, district medical officers, sanitary inspectors, etc.

The Bermuda Welfare Society (which is state aided) maintains district nurses in each parish.

The legislature provided £36,500 and £2,500 respectively for the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital and the Bermuda Nursing Home towards their operation in 1946.

Education

In 1839 the colonial legislature first granted a sum of money to aid elementary schools.

The central control is vested in a Board of Education consisting of 10 members appointed by the Governor under the provisions of the Schools Act, 1922.

There is no free education, apart from a number of local scholarships, all schools charging fees which vary from 6d. a week to about £20 per annum. Attendance is compulsory, the school leaving age being 13 years, and when accommodation is increased this will be raised to 14 years.

During 1944 there were 27 state-aided schools with a roll of 5,262 scholars. In addition there were 17 schools which received no financial aid.

In August, 1905, the legislature established an annual scholarship of £150, tenable by youths, natives of Bermuda, for two years at some educational institution abroad to be approved by the Governor, with a view to assisting youths to prepare to compete for the Rhodes' Scholarship awarded to Bermuda. The amount was increased to £200 per annum in 1920, and the tenure of the scholarship to three years in 1927.

At the end of the year 1924, the Bermuda (Technical Education) Scholarship Act was passed establishing four new scholarships each of the value of £125, subsequently increased to £150, and tenable for four years at some educational institution out of the colony.

Labour Services

The Labour Board, whose chairman is a member of the legislature, maintains an office for the purpose of co-ordinating the supply of and demand for labour. There is legislation for the settlement of labour disputes.
