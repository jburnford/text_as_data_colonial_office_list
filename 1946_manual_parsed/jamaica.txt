JAMAICA

SITUATION AND AREA

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. latitude 17° 42' 20" and 18° 32' 30", and W. longitude 76° 11' 55" and 78° 23' 35". It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length and 50 miles in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,450 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,388 feet high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the south-west, and the Rio Grande in the north-east. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 110,083 in 1943, is situated on the south coast of the island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between N. latitude 19° 16' and 19° 45', and W. longitude 79° 83' and 81° 30', and the Turks and Caicos Islands, are dependencies of Jamaica,* as are also Pedro and Morant Cays (two guano islands in N. latitude 17°).

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,568,560 acres, from which may be deducted 416,452 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, towns, etc., 311,960 acres of cultivable land not used and 195,200 acres of farm land used for homes, roads, water catchments and the like; 1,286,420 acres were reported as under cultivation in January, 1943.

HISTORY

The island was discovered by Columbus on 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann’s Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, the Governor of Hispaniola. It was raided by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596-97, and by Colonel Jackson in 1643, but it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II, who appointed General Edward Doyley Governor-in-Chief, with an elected council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. Part of this town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston, which then consisted of a few sheds, soon rose into a place of importance. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves. These consisted primarily of the slaves the Spaniards left, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains, but before long runaway slaves from English masters took refuge in the mountains of the centre of the island and were only subjugated in 1738, when both classes of maroons were settled in five reserves under their own leaders, and henceforth gave little trouble except for a partial rising in 1795, which was soon suppressed, the prisoners taken being sent to Sierra Leone. When the Slave Trade was abolished in 1807 there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833 Jamaica received £6,161,927 of the £20,000,000 granted by...
the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A rebellion among the coloured population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1907, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of £150,000 was voted by Parliament, and a loan of £800,000, chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer.

**Climate and Inhabitants**

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°7', rising to 87°6' in the day time, and falling to 71°0' in the early morning. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° lower in temperature can be attained by a ride of one hour by motor car.

The rainy seasons occur, usually, over the whole Island, in May and June, and again in September, October and November. Besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by occasional showers in other months. In the north-eastern portion of the Island, however, there is generally a rainy season at the end of the year and light precipitation, as a rule, during the month of March.

The mean annual rainfall varies in the several sections of the Island from 24 inches at the Quarantine station, in the southern division, to 208 inches at Moore Town, followed by 173 inches at Fellowship, both situated on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain range in the north-eastern division. The sixty-year Island average is 74 inches.

Regions of the Island are visited by storms of hurricane force about 14 times in a century and disastrous earthquakes occurred in 1692 and 1907.

Under one per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, somewhat over three-fourths being pure negroes. There are about 21,393 East Indians and about 6,900 Chinese (in 1943). English is universally spoken.

**Constitution**

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II in 1662, which, after existing for 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a nominated Council, and an elected Assembly which, on its first meeting in 1664, consisted of 30 members but which fluctuated in numbers from time to time. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored. A separate Privy Council was set up and an Executive Committee was established. The latter was to act as a sort of cabinet, especially as regards financial matters.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong government might be created. The Legislature responded by abrogating all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the colony.

Accordingly a Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the Constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty might from time to time appoint, or as the Governor might from time to time provisionally appoint, and 14 persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council was dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it had not been previously dissolved.

There was also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons as might be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty, but the number of members was not to exceed eight. The Governor presided at each meeting, and the Governor and two members formed a quorum.

A special feature of this Constitution was that nine elected members could veto any financial measure, while the unanimous vote of the whole 14 elected members on other matters could not be overridden by the other votes unless the Governor declared that such a decision was of paramount importance in the public interest.

A new Constitution was granted to Jamaica by His Majesty and was brought into effect by Proclamation on 20th November, 1944.

Under the terms of this Constitution there is established a Privy Council, an Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

**Privy Council**

The Privy Council comprises the Colonial Secretary, Officer Commanding the Troops, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary and Treasurer and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The functions of this body are to advise the Governor in relation to the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service, the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy and the grant of respites or remissions of sentence.

**Executive Council**

The Executive Council, which is the principal instrument of policy, comprises the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary and Treasurer, two unofficial members of the
Legislative Council appointed by the Governor, and five members of the House of Representatives elected by that body. The Governor presides over the Executive Council and has a casting, but not an original, vote and, although in general bound to accept the advice of the Executive Council, may in certain circumstances decline to accept that advice and report his reasons for so doing to the Secretary of State. The Executive Council is responsible for the preparation of estimates and for the initiation of all financial measures.

**Legislative Council**

This Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary and Treasurer, two official members "who shall be persons holding office of emolument under the Crown in Jamaica" and not less than ten unofficial members "who shall be persons not holding any office of emolument under the Crown in Jamaica."

The Council elects a President who is paid a salary at the rate of £600 per annum. Other nominated members of the Council are reimbursed travelling expenses, but receive no remuneration.

**House of Representatives**

The 14 parishes of the colony have been divided into 32 single member constituencies elected upon adult suffrage franchise for a term of five years. Members are required to have been ordinarily resident in the parish in which their constituency is comprised for 12 months immediately preceding the day of election.

The House elects from amongst its members a Speaker of the House and five members to serve as elected members of the Executive Council.

The Speaker receives a salary of £800 and members are paid at the rate of £550 per annum in addition to travelling and subsistence allowance.

At the first election to the House of Representatives held on 14th December, 1944, the Jamaica Labour Party was successful in 22 of the 32 constituencies, the People's National Party in five and the other constituencies returned Independent candidates.

**Administration**

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties, an excise duty on rum, stamp and licence duties, income tax and excess profits tax.

There is a Supreme Court of Judicature together with resident magistrate courts and petty sessions of justices of the peace throughout the Island. The resident magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of petty sessions.

An "Island Medical Service" under the control of a Director of Medical Services, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "Medical Officers." They are located throughout the Island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and alms-houses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions viz., poorhouses, etc., managed by the parochial board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the parochial boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision.

There is a corporation of the amalgamated parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew with a mayor, council and corporate officers.

In the 13 other parishes there are elected parochial boards under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, water works and pounds.

The chief towns with their respective populations (1943 census) are:

- Kingston, 108,973; St. Ann’s Bay, 3,133;
- Brown’s Town, 2,663; Spanish Town, 12,028;
- Linestead, 2,254; Old Harbour, 1,925; Black River, 1,263; Montego Bay, 11,500; Port Maria, 3,167; Annotto Bay, 2,805; Port Morant, 4,438; Morant Bay, 3,699; May Pen, 6,038; Lucea, 1,806; Mandeville, 2,110; Christiana, 2,825; Port Royal, 1,055; Port Antonio, 5,482; Buff Bay, 1,252; Palmouth, 2,561; Savanna-la-mar, 4,046.

The estimated total revenue of all the local bodies in 1944–45 was £942,542; their expenditure £941,158.

**Currency and Banking**

**Metallic Currency**

British silver of all denominations circulates freely in Jamaica.

Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage issued under Law 49 of 1869 and Law 3 of 1943, respectively, of penny, halfpenny and farthing denominations are in circulation.

**Notes**

Four commercial banks operate in Jamaica, Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.), Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Bank of Commerce. Their aggregate note circulation on 31st December, 1945, was £139,203.

Jamaica Government currency notes issued under Cap. 275 in circulation on 31st December, 1945, amounted to £2,898,782.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871. There are 168 branches now operating. The total deposits on 31st March, 1945, was £2,378,014.

**People’s Co-operative Banks**

People’s co-operative banks are registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Law, Chapter 263. At 31st March, 1945, 112 banks were registered as agricultural loan societies under Section 41 of the Agricultural Loan Societies Law, 1944.

The management of these banks is in the hands of members, but they are supervised by the Agricultural Loan Societies Board.

Banks operating as agricultural loan societies are allowed to accept deposits in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Loan Societies Law, 1944. The chief business of the banks, however, is the provision of credit for co-operative, agricultural and industrial objects.

The total membership of the banks under the supervision of the Agricultural Loan Societies Board at 31st December, 1944, was 51,123, the issued share capital was £124,392 10s. and the paid-up share capital £74,352 17s. 4d. These figures indicate the success achieved by the banks and show the confidence in which they are held by small farmers.
The Agricultural Loan Societies Board now makes advances to agricultural loan societies from the Agricultural Credit Revolving Fund created by Law 28 of 1944. The amount at credit of this fund at 31st March, 1945 was £285,000. The following statement sets out the position at 31st March, 1945, of the various types of loan issued by the Board to banks:

People’s co-operative banks are the medium used by Government to assist agriculturists who have suffered loss by hurricane or other natural calamity, and rehabilitation loans were issued after the hurricanes in 1912, 1916, 1917, 1935, 1939 and 1943. After the disastrous hurricane in August, 1944, the Imperial Government came to the assistance of the Island and placed a sum of £2,004,000 at the disposal of the Jamaica Government for the rehabilitation of agriculturists. This sum was made available to the Agricultural Loan Societies Board for issue to agriculturists through the medium of co-operative banks.

At 31st March, 1945, applications for rehabilitation loans were still being received and considered. The following statement shows the advances issued to banks for re-loan to sufferers at that date:

| Type of Loan                        | Amount Advanced | Balance Outstanding |

Every effort is being made to ensure that the members of these banks understand and appreciate their aims and objects and the privileges and responsibilities of membership, and, in 1943, an educational programme was started with financial assistance from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Elementary education is provided for from public funds. The number of recognised elementary schools is 667, of which 194 are Government schools and the remainder denominational. There are 114,743 scholars in average attendance and the grant-in-aid for 1944–45 was £528,183; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges for women teachers. By a law passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. Local School Boards manage the Government schools, some of which are held in Government buildings, others in rented buildings.
The Government maintains a technical continuation and commercial school in Kingston and awards scholarships for trade instruction and apprenticeship. One continuation school for girls is aided from public funds. Three practical training centres for boys and one for girls are maintained by Government.

Provision was made in 1892 for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are 23 secondary schools receiving aid from public funds under regulations for grants in aid. Secondary education is provided for in general by endowed schools, under local governing bodies controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. There are four scholarships (one for girls, and one for girls and boys in alternate years) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire and one scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica. Awards were discontinued during the war. Additional post-war scholarships are being awarded as far as conditions at Oxford permit. The following examinations are held: London University, Cambridge Locals, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society.

In the Institute of Jamaica (in Kingston) is a public library with 40,000 books, of which 9,000 form a West India Reference Library; a natural history museum, with a small collection of live animals; and a Jamaica history gallery with 600 portraits and 350 engravings of scenery.

Labour

On 12th September, 1938, an Unemployment Registration Bureau was set up for the primary purpose of ascertaining the extent of unemployment in the corporate area, and its function was later extended to some of the country parishes.

A Labour Department was established on 5th June, 1939, to deal with the several labour problems of the Island and Mr. F. A. Norman, O.B.E., was seconded from the Ministry of Labour, England, as Labour Adviser. The staff and duties of the Unemployment Registration Bureau were absorbed in the new department, and the Kingston Employment Bureau established to deal specially with the registration and placement of the unemployed in the corporate area.

The department aims at the promotion and maintenance of amicable relationships between employers and workers by advising associations of employers and trade unions in the light of the latest trends in industrial relations organisation and practice, by the regular inspection of factories in the interests of the health and safety of workers, and by the promotion of minimum wage legislation.

To date minimum rates for the following industries and trades have been declared in accordance with the provision of the Minimum Wage Law, after investigations by the department's minimum wage branch:

(1) The sugar industry ... 1942
(2) The bread and cake bakery trade. 1944
(3) The biscuit trade ... 1945
(4) The printing trade ... 1945

A minimum wage board for the dry goods trade is now at work, and the reports of other boards are receiving consideration.

Following a proclamation which made the Factories Law of 1940 effective as from 1st August, 1943, 531 factories employing 13,456 males and 3,991 female workers have applied for registration.

The department's two inspectors pay regular visits to ensure that modern safety and health measures are observed in these establishments.

Since its inception the department has been responsible for the recruitment and despatch of approximately 59,000 persons for service with the Royal Air Force, and in munitions factories in the United Kingdom, in agriculture and industry in the United States of America and for work in the Panama Canal zone. This involved not only the examination of nearly 150,000 applicants but the preparation of work contracts in the light of the requirements of relevant international labour conventions.

The statistical branch of the department was as from 1st November, 1945, merged into the new Central Bureau of Statistics, instituted from that date. Up to that time, cost of living indexes, wage statistics, etc., were prepared and collected by the department.

LANDS

The new Lands Department was created in the latter part of 1939 pursuant to a resolution of Legislative Council dated 31st July, 1939, and its functions include the administration and development of properties purchased for land settlements, Crown land forfeitures and generally all matters affecting land administration in the colony.

The department now administers:

One hundred and nine land settlement properties purchased from general revenue and loan funds provided for the purpose.

Telegraphs

Overseas telegraphic communications are operated by Cable and Wireless (West Indies), Ltd., working in close association with Cable and Wireless, Ltd., London, providing world-wide facilities by submarine cable and wireless telegraph circuits with particular emphasis on British Empire communications.

Automatic Duplex signalling is available from Kingston to London, Montreal, New York, Halifax, N.S., Bermuda, Barbadoes, Cuba, and Porto Rico, and direct wireless circuits with Nassau, Bahamas, Belize, British Honduras, and Cayman Islands.

Communication with ships at sea off Jamaica is maintained through the company’s Kingston W/T Station (V Q I).

Radiotelephone facilities are also provided by Cable and Wireless (West Indies), Ltd., inter-connecting with the public telephone services in Jamaica.

All the West India cables mentioned above were taken over and operated by the West India and Panama Telegraph Company in conjunction with Cable and Wireless, Ltd., as from 1st January, 1937.

Telegraph lines connect all the principal towns, and there are 218 telegraph and telephone stations. The total wire mileage is 2,381 miles, 34½ chains, and total pole mileage, 1,630 miles, 8½ chains.

Railways

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of St. James, a distance of 112 miles 60 chains, and to Port Antonio, in the parish of Portland, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 63 miles; and to Ewarton, by a branch line from Bog Walk, on the Port Antonio branch, of 8 miles 40 chains, and by a branch line from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; also from Logans Junction to Fort Simonds, 5 miles 20 chains. The total length of line open is 212½ miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the Company, having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge for 1944-45, providing for interest only, was £49,094. The receipts in 1944-45 were less than the expenditure by £104,431, leaving a deficiency, including interest charges, of £153,154. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 112½ miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 1½ miles; from Bog Walk to Port Antonio, 5½ miles; from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; and from Logans Junction to Fort Simonds, 5½ miles.

Roads

The island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring, the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum grades are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,528 miles of main roads, and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads.

Steamship Services

Steamship communications with this Island are at present irregular.

A limited service is maintained to Europe by Messrs. Elders & Fyffes and Royal Mail Lines, Ltd., to U.S.A. by United Fruit Co., Standard Fruit and Steamship Co., and Webster Steamship Co., and to Canada by Canadian National Steamship Co.

A coastal service is run by the Royal Mail Lines, Ltd., and local commercial shipping agencies whenever cargo is available.
The United Fruit Co., the Royal Mail Lines, Ltd., the Jamaica Banana Producers Association, Ltd., the Standard Fruit & Steamship Corp., the Harrison Line, the Pickford & Black Steamship Co. and the Canadian National Steamship Co. maintain a regular steamship service and also call at outports when necessary.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, Port Maria, St. Ann's Bay and Savanna-la-Mar are ports of registry. One ship was built during 1940 and one during 1944.

### Customs Tariff

The import duties are collected at both specific and ad valorem rates. The articles paying specific duties fall chiefly under the heads of food, drink and tobacco. Provision is made for preferential rates on Empire products. The general ad valorem duty is 20 per cent. and the preferential rate is 15 per cent. There are slight variations in these rates on certain classes of goods.

The following tables give statistics of trade with the United Kingdom, other parts of the Empire and the principal foreign countries during the period from 1939 to 1944.

CAYMAN ISLANDS

DESCRIPTION

The Cayman Islands, which form a dependency of Jamaica, consist of three islands—Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac—lying between 79° 83' and 81° 30' W. longitude and 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. latitude, and having a total area of about 104 square miles. They were discovered by Columbus on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession soon after the conquest of Jamaica in the middle of the seventeenth century and the islands were mainly colonised from Jamaica, though many English and Scottish mariners, shipwrecked on the coast of Cuba, settled on the islands.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is considerably larger than in other parts of the West Indies.

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, with a varying breadth from 4 to 7 miles, and has an area of 85 square miles. The total population of the islands is 6,670, of which some 5,311 live in Grand Cayman, where Georgetown, the capital town, with a population of 1,462, is situated.

The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized deep-water harbours.

INDUSTRIES, TRADE AND CUSTOMS

The chief industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle—or "turling," as it is called—These turtles are brought to the island and placed in tanks to recover and fatten before export. The total number of turtle exported in 1944 amounted to 1,328, valued at £3,057.

The people are first-class shipbuilders and many fine schooners are built in these islands for local use and sale abroad.

Georgetown is a port of registry and 28 sailing vessels and 13 motor vessels, with an aggregate net tonnage of 3,896, are on the registry of shipping there.

The islands are in some parts fruitful and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honeycombed limestone and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found.

Many of the islanders find employment on the mainland of America and in foreign vessels, supporting their families in Cayman by remittances from abroad.

An ad valorem customs duty of 12½ per cent. is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. The revenue derived from these duties amounted to £11,590 in 1944–45.

There is a British preferential tariff on certain articles.

CLIMATE

The climate from November to March is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, but during the summer months it is hot, with southerly winds. Mosquitoes abound in the summer. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1945 was 52·56 inches, the average annual rainfall being about 64·92 inches.

The more recent hurricanes at the islands occurred in October, 1944; November, 1932; September, 1917; August, 1909; and August, 1903—previous to this there was a severe hurricane in October, 1876. During 1935 a modern meteorological station was erected at Georgetown, and observations taken form an important study of meteorological phenomena in the Caribbean, especially in connection with hurricanes.

COMMUNICATIONS

A regular motor-schooner service is maintained from Georgetown with Kingston, Jamaica. There is also communication by sailing and motor vessels with the ports of Central America and the United States.

There are motorable roads connecting every district in both Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac.

There are two wireless stations: Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and Stake Bay, Cayman Brac; the latter established in 1936, the former in 1935. The principal tariffs per word are (deferred): Jamaica, 6d.; United Kingdom, 1s. 3d.; Canada, 1s. 2d.; New York, 1s.

EDUCATION

Education is in charge of a Board of Education which receives an annual grant from the public revenue. Thirteen public elementary schools are maintained, with a roll of 784 pupils and an average attendance of 572.

CONSTITUTION

The Government is administered by a commissioner who is also judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the peace (at present 25) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members, constitute the Legislative Assembly. Under the presidency of the Commissioner, the Assembly is held biennially.
The present constitution of this Assembly of Justices and Vestry is 100 years old and the centenary was commemorated by a special issue of postage stamps in 1932.

### Finances

| Year    | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1942/43 | £18,925 | £12,703     |
| 1943/44 | £27,933 | £22,137     |
| 1944/45 | £21,155 | £28,533     |

The public debt amounts to £7,883, being made up of loans by the Jamaica Government (a) in 1933 to assist in repairing the damage caused by the hurricane of 1932; (b) in 1938 for the construction of certain works of improvement in the dependency.

The dependency has £25,076 invested as a reserve fund and £2,000 as a hurricane fund.

### Imports and Exports

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1942 | £55,072 | £9,762  |
| 1943 | £71,283 | £9,971  |
| 1944 | £82,494 | £12,861 |

### Turks and Caicos Islands

#### Situation and Area

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. latitude and 71° and 72° 37' W. longitude at the extreme south-eastern end of the Bahama chain. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos group by the 22-mile wide Turks Islands Passage. The combined area of both groups is about 166 square miles.

#### Climate

The climate is equable and healthy and rarely unpleasantly hot owing to the constant trade winds.

The mean temperature (day) during 1944 was 70·8°, the extreme range being from 62° to 92°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1944 amounted to 26·40 inches, and the average rainfall for the five years 1939-1944 was 32·35 inches.

Hurricanes strike the dependency periodically, almost always during the month of September. There were severe hurricanes in 1926, 1928 and 1945, the last being the worst within living memory.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., at Grand Turk; reports on local weather conditions are sent to Miami every six hours during the 24.

#### General Description

Geographically the islands are part of the Bahama chain, and have the same flat characteristics. Economically they are divided into two distinct parts, the salt-producing islands of Grand Turk, Salt Cay and South Caicos; and the remainder of the Caicos group, where the people are peasant farmers and fishermen. Food supplies for the salt-producing islands are imported from abroad, but during the winter months some vegetables are sent to these islands from the outlying Caicos.

The only industry is salt-raking. All salt is exported by the Salt Industry Board, and before the war exports averaged 50,000 tons annually. Since 1942 there has been a severe depression in the salt business, owing to the difficulty of obtaining tonnage to lift salt.

### History

The Turks and Caicos Islands were discovered in 1512 by Ponce de Leon. From 1678 they were visited by Bermudians who remained in Grand Turk during the summers to rake salt and returned to Bermuda during winter. In 1710 the salt-rakers were driven out by the Spaniards, but they in their turn drove the Spaniards from the islands. During the next 40 years brushes with the Spaniards were a frequent occurrence, but the salt-rakers armed their ships and gave as good as they got.

In 1753 and again in 1764 the French attacked the salt-rakers and took them to Haiti as prisoners. A treaty between the French and English commissioners in Jamaica ended these depredations.

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the southern states of America after the War of Independence. Cotton was cultivated until 1812 but drought and insect plagues caused the industry to fail, and after the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, leaving their former slaves in possession.

In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, in spite of vigorous protests by the Bermudian salt-rakers. These protests were continued until 1848 when a separate charter was granted to the islands, divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas.

After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 addressed a petition to Her Majesty praying that the islands might be annexed to the colony of Jamaica. The Legislative Council of Jamaica agreed, and on 1st January, 1874, the Turks and Caicos Islands were annexed to Jamaica, and still remain one of its dependencies.

### Constitution

In the Order-in-Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This board now consists of three official and three unofficial nominated members appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. The Commissioner is ex-officio President of the Board. The board is empowered to make ordinances for financial measures and for matters of a local character, but these ordinances do not become law until the Governor has given his assent to them.

Laws passed by the legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenue and expenditure of the Dependency are kept distinct from those of Jamaica.

### The Legislative Board

The Commissioner (President).
The Magistrate.
The Treasurer.
W. S. Jones, M.B.E.
E. G. Ewing.
F. B. Harriott.
There is a Government senior school at Grand Turk which takes children up to the school certificate standard.

**Kenya**

**Situation and Area**

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate", previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, roughly extends from latitude 4° N. to latitude 4° S. and from longitude 34° E. to longitude 41° E. It is bounded on the north by Abyssinia and the Sudan, on the west by the Uganda Protectorate, on the south by Tanganyika territory and on the east by the Indian Ocean and Somalia.

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891), and the northern by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which a rent of £10,000 per annum is paid to the Sultan of Zanzibar.
The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-chief. It was transferred, in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted executive and legislative councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order-in-Council, 1920", the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a colony. This Order in Council came into operation on 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

The northern part of the Colony, comprising three-fifths of the whole, is arid and comparatively waterless. The southern strip, in which almost all economic production is centred, comprises a low-lying coastal area and a plateau raised by volcanic action to a height varying from 3,000 feet to 10,000 feet. This area includes Mount Kenya (17,040 feet), Mount Elgon (14,000 feet), the Aberdare Range (about 12,000 feet to 13,000 feet) and part of the Great Rift Valley which is some 30 to 40 miles wide and often 2,000 feet to 3,000 feet lower than the country bounding it on either side. The land on the northern strip is traversed by the Kenya and Uganda Railway and that which lies outside townships is divided principally between native areas, and alienated farmland in European occupation.

The Colony includes parts of two of the great African lakes; the land area is 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

The total area of 219,730 square miles may be divided as follows:

| Square miles |
|--------------|
| Native areas (including native settlement areas) | 52,038 |
| Crown forests | 4,746 |
| Townships, township reserves, etc. | 291 |
| Other Government reserves | 284 |
| Alienated land and land available for alienation | 12,351 |
| Northern frontier, Turkana and extension from Uganda | 115,393 |
| Unclassified areas | 34,627 |
| **Total** | **219,730** |

The capital is Nairobi and the principal port Mombasa. Other towns having municipal status are Nakuru in the centre of the European farming district, Kisumu situated on Lake Victoria, and Eldoret.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into four provinces and three extra-provincial districts, viz:

- The Nyanza Province (comprises the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho and Kisumu-Londiani).
- The Rift Valley Province (comprises the districts of Nakuru, Baringo, Laikipia-Samburu, Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo, Trans Nzoia and West Suk).
- The Central Province (comprises the districts of Nairobi, Kiambu, Thika, Fort Hall, Nyeri, Embu, Meru, Machakos and Kitui).
- The Coast Province (comprises the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Teita, Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu).
- The Northern Frontier District (comprises the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, Garissa and Mandera).
- The Turkana District.
- The Masai District (comprises the districts of Narok and Kajiado).

The capital of the Colony is Nairobi. A municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as:

| Year | Europeans | Asiatics | Natives |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1938 | 6,500     | 18,500   | 40,000  |
| 1939 | 6,800     | 17,700   | 41,000  |
| 1945 | 10,400    | 31,900   | 66,600  |
| Total| 65,000    | 65,500   | 108,900 |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 95,000 of whom about 1,500 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours. Mombasa harbour is on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928.

The total population was estimated at 31st December, 1944, as follows:

| Category          | Population |
|-------------------|------------|
| Europeans         | 23,418     |
| Indians           | 73,962     |
| Goans             | 6,002      |
| Arabs             | 24,746     |
| Other non-natives | 5,288      |
| **Total non-natives** | **133,416** |
| Africans          | 3,852,000  |
| **Total**         | **3,985,416** |

On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Kipsigis, the Suk, the Turkana, the Masai, the Somali and the Galla.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing 13 different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

**CONSTITUTION**

Under the Royal Instructions dated 29th March, 1934, amended on 26th May, 1938, the Executive Council of the colony consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Chief Native Commissioner (ex-officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. There are three such unofficial members. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the colony shall consist of the Governor as President, 11 ex-officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, 11 European elected members, five
Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, two nominated unofficial members to represent the interests of the African community and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the Arab community. The ex-officio members are the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, with the Commissioner for Lands, Mines and Surveys, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, Director of Education, General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the colony should be Governor of the protectorate, that the Executive Council of the colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the colony to legislate for the protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the colony and protectorate.

The 1924 ordinance governing the election of European, Indian and Arab members to the Legislative Council was consolidated and amended in 1935, but not brought into operation until 1937, when new registers of voters were compiled for the general elections which took place in 1938. Under amendments to the 1924 ordinance the boundaries of several of the 11 European electoral areas had been altered, and certain areas renamed. These were continued in the 1935 ordinance, which, however, provided for three Indian electoral areas (two each to return two members and the other one) in place of the whole country forming one constituency returning five members. For Arabs, the whole country is still one constituency. The Indian and Arab franchise, like the European, is adult (over 21 years) suffrage, except that in the latter case it is made subject to the ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various native councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

**East Africa Governors' Conference**

An account of the constitution of the Standing Conference of East Africa Governors is given in the introduction to Part II.

**Land and Products**

With altitudes varying from sea level to over 9,000 feet, Kenya lends itself for the production of a wide range of crops. In the areas above 5,000 feet coffee, tea, maize, wattle bark, pyrethrum and wheat are the principal crops. At the lower altitudes sisal, cotton and oilseeds are most important. Other crops grown in various parts of the colony include beans, potatoes, sorghums, millets, pulses, coconuts, cashew nuts, sugar cane, vegetables, fruit and essential oil plants.

Beef production, dairying, sheep and pigs form an increasingly important role in the general agricultural policy of the colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skin, wool and bacon are produced annually.

The local market is well supplied with the main food staples and also with a tempting variety of specialities of local production and preparations. With the large number of personnel of the armed forces stationed in the colony throughout the war the internal consumption of all agricultural commodities has increased considerably but in spite of this factor the export trade in agricultural and pastoral products reached a total of £3,463,000 in 1944 as compared with 3,200,629 in 1937.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and on Lake Victoria, and an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The forest products of the colony have played an important part in meeting the heavy demands of the armed forces during the war. On the coast mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony and gum copal are the main products. In the highland forests are found large quantities of pencil cedar and several other good timbers such as podocarpus, olive and East African camphor, also large areas of bamboos suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

The following minerals have been located:

- **Gold.**—Has been found throughout the Nyanza Province and in the Loigoriien district of the Masai reserve. Traces of gold have been found in various areas occupied by Basement System rocks.

- **Silver.**—Is commonly associated with gold in Nyanza and also occurs in galena ores in the Coast Province.

- **Amblygonite.**—Has been found sporadically in pegmatites in Basement System areas.

- **Apatite.**—Has been located in small concentrations near Homa Bay in Southern Kavirondo.

- **Arsenopyrite.**—Is commonly associated with the gold mineralisation of Nyanza.

- **Asbestos.**—Of anthophyllite type occurs in Basement System rocks and is worked in Machakos and West Suk.

- **Barites.**—Of good quality is found in association with lead and zinc ores in the Coast Province.

- **Beryl.**—Has been found in pegmatites particularly in Machakos.

- **Clays.**—Of meta-betonite type have been found at Athi River, near Nairobi, and north of Mount Kenya. Ceramics clays are known in the Central and Coast Provinces.

- **Columbite.**—Sporadic occurrences of columbite-tantalite have been found in Basement System pegmatites.

- **Copper.**—Impregnations occur in association with pegmatites in the Tsavo area. Promising gold-copper deposits are being developed in Southern Kavirondo (Nyanza Province).

- **Corundum.**—Occurs in association with a dunite intrusion near Mtito Andei (Machakos).

- **Diatomite.**—Is widespread in Pleistocene lake beds in the Rift Valley. Five large deposits are known that are estimated to contain extensive reserves of the material.

- **Felspar.**—Suitable for ceramic purposes is found in pegmatites in Central Province.

- **Galena.**—Occurs in a barites-base metal vein in the Coast Province and is also known as thin veins in sandstones near Mazeras (also in the Coast Province).

- **Graphite.**—Occurs in Basement System gneisses and schists, and is best known in the Machakos, Southern Kitui and Tsavo areas.
Gypsum.—Is found plentifully in the Northern Frontier District especially near El-Wak and Garissa. Other deposits are known in Central Kitui and near Homa Bay.

Ilmenite.—Is widespread in areas of Basement System rocks.

Iron.—Magnetite and magnetite-haematite quartzites occur in the Basement System and form a possible source of ore for future requirements. Gossans and pyritic ore bodies in the goldfields of Nyanza are an additional possible source.

Kyanite.—Is abundant in the Machakos area and sometimes occurs in fine crystals that have been at times cut as gems. Extensive deposits of massive and unusually pure kyanite are being worked in the Taveta area (Coast Province).

Limestone.—Coral and other limestones are abundant in the Coast Province, and enormous quantities of crystalline limestone are available in Basement System areas, notably near Voi, Kajiado, Machakos, the Loldaika hills, Elgeyo and Suk. Lacustrine limestones are worked near Muhoroni and Homa Bay in Western Kenya. Extensive deposits of limestone of carbonatite type are also known in the Homa Bay area.

Manganese.—Occurs in the Coast Province, and small deposits have been located in the Central and Rift Valley Provinces.

Magnesite.—Has been exploited near Mtito Andei (Machakos). Other deposits are known in the northern frontier district.

Marble.—Is being exploited near Kajiado.

Mica.—Of sheet type occurs in pegmatites, and has been worked in Central Province and West Suk.

Molybdenite.—Traces have been found in Northern Kavirondo and near Maralal.

Monazite.—Is found in coastal beach sands.

Olivine.—Is concentrated in rivers draining from the Aberdares, and constitutes the bulk of a dunite intrusion near Mtito Andei.

Pigments.—Mineral pigments yielding yellow, chrome, brown, red and green colours are being worked, principally in Kitui and Machakos. Green pigments are also obtained in Turkana.

Pumice.—Occurs in the Rift Valley Province near Naivasha.

Pyrite.—Massive pyrite-pyrrhotite bodies have been located by diamond drilling in the Kakamega area.

Quartz.—Of optical and piezo-electrical quality has been found in Central Province.

Quicksilver.—In the form of cinnabar has been found in the Coast Province.

Rutile.—Is present in coastal sands.

Sapphire.—The corundum deposit at Mtito Andei has yielded small fragments of gem sapphire.

Sillimanite.—Schists have been discovered in the Machakos and Maralal areas.

Soapstone.—Extensive deposits are known in Southern Kavirondo.

Soda.—Is being extracted in large quantities from Lake Magadi by the Magadi Soda Company.

Talc.—Deposits have been found in the Machakos and West Suk districts.

Tin.—Traces of tin occur in Trans-Nzoia, and cassiterite is an accessory mineral in the Kisii sandstones.

Tungsten.—Scheelite has been found as an accessory mineral in a gold-quartz vein in central Kavirondo.

Vermiculite.—Deposits have been found at various localities in the Central Province and Masai district.

Zinc Blende.—Is present in a barytes-galena vein in the Coast Province.

Zircon.—Is an abundant constituent of river sands in Nyanza and the Coast Province.

TRADE, CUSTOMS AND EXCISE

Under the terms of the Congo Basin Treaties equality of treatment in respect of imported goods irrespective of origin is ensured, and the grant of Imperial Preference is therefore inadmissible. Goods declared as in transit are allowed to be imported and forwarded under customs control on payment of expenses of administration (6d. per package).

For purposes of customs, Kenya and Uganda form a single unit and by agreement with the Tanganyika Territory Government a common tariff has been accepted by the three territories, the free and unrestricted movement within the territories of both imported goods and local products being thus secured. The common tariff, however, includes a small number of "suspended duties" which are of a protective nature and may be imposed by proclamation either in part or in full in any or all of the territories.

The general duty rating under the common tariff is 20 per cent. ad valorem, based on the landed value at the port of entry, building materials, artisans' tools, and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on such articles as readily lend themselves to this form of assessment and in certain cases alternative specific or ad valorem charges are levied. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, packing materials, disinfectants, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, and many articles necessary for road construction, sanitation, irrigation and drainage purposes, and for the agricultural, industrial, and educational development of the territories.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of trade imports (excluding imports on Government account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya ports, were as follows:
