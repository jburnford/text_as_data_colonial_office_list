THE GAMBIA

SITUATION AND AREA

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but narrowing to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary’s Island. There are 26 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 13 feet can at present proceed without trouble to MacCarthy Island. There is no bar to the Gambia River.

The seat of government is Bathurst, 13° 27’ N., 16° 34’ W. long., situated on St. Mary’s Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The colony consists of the island of St. Mary, British Kombo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, the territories of Brefet and Bajana, and MacCarthy Island, situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and 158 miles distant from the latter. MacCarthy Island forms a line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the Upper River and Lower River. The total area of the colony is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey).

The Protectorate extends on both banks of the river for 250 miles from its mouth, and its area, including that of the parts of the colony administered as protectorate, is 3,999 square miles. The island of St. Mary has an area of about 2,500 acres. A survey of the boundaries dividing the Gambia from the Senegal was completed by the Anglo-French Boundary Commission in 1905.

CLIMATE

The climate of the Gambia during the dry season from the middle of November to the middle of May is pleasant and generally healthy. During the wet season from June to October the conditions are much the same as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa. The wettest month is August, and the most unpleasant month, owing to the humidity, is October. In the interior, the temperature varies between 60° and 110° and in Bathurst between 60° and 100°.

The rainfall is extremely variable from year to year, ranging between 30 and 50 inches.

HISTORY

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators but they made no settlement.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in London and Exeter to trade with the Gambia. This company did not prosper. Its voyages were not slave trading ventures but were made for legitimate commerce. In 1618, King James I of England granted a charter to Sir Robert Rich and other London merchants. Their enterprise was entitled “The Company of Adventurers of London trading in Africa,” and Fort James was built by them on a small island 17 miles above the island of Banjola (now St. Mary’s).

About the year 1631 another British chartered company was formed, King Charles I having granted a charter to Sir B. Young, Sir R. Digby
and others. This venture was responsible for supplying British settlements in the West Indies with slaves for working on the estates.

In 1662 King Charles II granted a charter to a third company known as "The Royal Adventurers of England trading in Africa." A few years later this company exhausted its capital and surrendered its charter. In 1672 a fourth company was incorporated under the name of "The Royal African Company," and it was not until 1752, after having in its early days reached the highest point of commercial prosperity which had been touched by England in Africa, that it was superseded by "The Company of Merchants."

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles, 1783, which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. The year 1807 saw the abolition of the slave trade, and though "The Company of Merchants" lingered on with an annual subsidy, the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed on the island of Banjola by the English merchants who resided at Goree and in Senegal until those places were given up to the French by the Treaty of Paris (1814). The island was renamed St. Mary's and the town, which was laid out, took its name from Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State at that time. The streets to be inhabited first were named after Lord Wellington and his generals at Waterloo.

The settlement was subject to the government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a military commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court," administered the government. From 1822 to 1829 the commandant governed alone.

In December, 1829, the Secretary of State appointed Lieutenant Colonel Alex. Findlay, R.A.C. Corps, as Lieutenant Governor (the first) "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia." The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force, but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the officer administering the government there.

The Gambia, in the year 1843, was created an independent colony with a governor and executive and legislative councils for the administration of its affairs. Captain H. P. Seagram, R.N., was the first governor of the colony.

By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West African Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823 and named after Major-General Sir Charles MacCarthy, K.C.B., Governor-in-Chief of the British West African possessions; the ceded mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and the British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions in 1840, 1850 and 1855.

In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection.

Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894, and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned, until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole protectorate, which is now divided into four divisions and again into districts. There is a commissioner in charge of each division and each district is under a head chief.

CONSTITUTION

Under the Royal Instructions dated 27th February, 1915, the Executive Council of the colony consists of the Colonial Secretary as an ex officio member and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed; these are at present the Receiver-General, the Attorney-General, the Senior Commissioner and the Senior Medical Officer, who are, however, appointed by name and not by office. The Governor is the President of the Council, and he may on any special occasion when he desires the opinion of any person within the colony summon such person as an extraordinary member. This provision precludes the possibility of a person resident within the protectorate being summoned as an extraordinary member. At present there is no unofficial representation on the Executive Council.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor as President, the Colonial Secretary as an ex officio member, and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed. At present, apart from the Colonial Secretary, there are five official members and four unofficial members. By custom, one of the unofficial members represents Mohammedan interests, one represents commercial interests and two represent African interests generally. But new instruments are in course of preparation which will provide for an elected member for the colony areas of the island of St. Mary and the Kombo St. Mary district, and a protectorate member, in addition to other nominated unofficial members.

By regulations made by the Queen-in-Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890, and dated 23rd November, 1893, it was provided that the Legislative Council for the colony should legislate for the territories adjacent to the colony over which Her Majesty had acquired jurisdiction, that is, for the protectorate of the Gambia.

The Supreme Court of the colony normally sits at Bathurst, but may sit in any part of the colony. The High Court of the protectorate exercises in the protectorate the same jurisdiction as the Supreme Court exercises in the colony. There is provision for trial by jury in the colony, but provision is also made whereby the judge may sit with assessors in lieu of a jury. There is no provision for trial by jury in the protectorate. The Colonial Magistrate exercises a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction in the colony, and ranks as a first-class magistrate throughout the protectorate. In the protectorate, there is a protectorate court in every division, the commissioner in charge of the division being a magistrate with first-class powers; provision is made whereby other suitable persons may be appointed magistrates with either first or second-class powers in the protectorate. In Bathurst there is also the Mohammedan court presided over by the Cadi, which has jurisdiction to try cases, contentious or uncontentious, between or exclusively
affecting Mohammedan natives, relating to civil status, marriage, succession, donations, testaments and guardianship.

In addition to these courts there are throughout the protectorate native tribunals established by warrant under the Native Tribunals Ordinance, 1933. These tribunals are of two grades, one having a greater jurisdiction than the other, but they correspond generally to the native courts or tribunals found in other colonies and protectorates. The Commissioner exercises a general power of revision, amounting in effect to appeal, over proceedings in native tribunals.

In all cases before all classes of courts, local ideas and customs are taken into consideration whenever they are relevant to the issues.

**LAND**

The law relating to the tenure and management of lands in the colony and protectorate is contained in two ordinances enacted in 1945, the Colony Lands Ordinance and the Protectorate Lands Ordinance. The first is in effect a consolidating ordinance, and codifies the law as it has been for a long time.

There is a considerable amount of freehold land in the colony; in addition there are a number of Crown leases, and the remainder of the land is occupied by the Crown. Generally, Crown leases are not granted for a greater period than 21 years in the first instance, and there is provision for revision of rent.

Prior to the enactment of the Protectorate Lands Ordinance, the Governor exercised over land in the protectorate the same powers of disposition and management as he exercises over land in the colony. The Protectorate Lands Ordinance, however, vests all protectorate lands in the native authorities, to be held and administered for the common benefit, direct or indirect, of the communities concerned. The ordinance makes strict provisions for the occupation of land by non-indigenes: no non-indigene may acquire a greater interest than a lease for 21 years in the first instance, and provision is made for rent revision. No protectorate land may in any circumstances whatsoever be permanently alienated, not even to the Gambia Government. All revenues derived from lands in the protectorate form part of the revenue of the native authorities concerned; all leases held from the Crown at the time of the coming into operation of the ordinance were automatically transferred to the appropriate native authorities as lessors. This ordinance goes further than any law in force in other colonies and protectorates in that it fully recognises that protectorate lands belong to the indigenous communities, and should be administered for, and as far as possible by, them.

**POPULATION**

Figures for Bathurst are:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1911 | 7,700      |
| 1921 | 9,227      |
| 1931 | 14,370     |
| 1944 | 21,152     |

The large increase in 1944 may be attributed to the works undertaken by the services during the war years and the consequent influx of labour.

The figures for the protectorate, from the assessment for tax purposes taken by commissioners in 1945, were 216,000.

These figures are made up mainly from the following races:

- Mandingo: 90,000
- Wolof: 30,000
- Fula: 25,000
- Jola: 25,000
- Serahuli: 15,000
- Tukulor (branch of Fula tribe): 15,000

The Mandingoes derive their names from Manding, a town some 700 miles inland and towards the north-east boundary of Sierra Leone. They are almost entirely Mohammedans.

The Wollofs form the largest part of the population of Bathurst. Outside Bathurst they are found mainly on the north bank of the river.

The Fulbe, more commonly known as Fula, are the main breeders of cattle and are found chiefly in the Upper River division. Their features are somewhat of the Arabic type and their skins are of a lighter colour than negroes. The Fulbe are sub-divided into nine sub-tribes, Fulbe Firdu, Jombo, Lorobo, Habobo, Hamanabi, Torodo, Jawando, Labo, Fulbe Futo, which fall into three linguistic divisions.

The Jolas came from Fonti between the southern limit of Kombo and the north bank of the Casamance River. Their country runs in a northeasterly direction towards the south bank of the Gambia River as far as the mouth of the Bintang Creek. They were originally pagans but an increasing number are becoming Mohammedans.

The Serahulis are the most recent arrivals in the Gambia, having migrated from the interior of Senegal in the 19th century. They are found mainly in the extreme east of the protectorate and are all Mohammedans.

The social organisation of the above-mentioned tribes is in the main based on the Patrilineal Kin group, segments of which are commonly scattered among a number of sometimes quite distant villages.

**ADMINISTRATION**

**(a) Colony**

Certain portions of colony land are administered under the Protectorate Ordinance, the only portion with separate colony administration at present being the island of St. Mary on which Bathurst is situated. Here a temporary local authority with an African elected majority, and with the Commissioner, Island of St. Mary, as chairman, has taken over a number of local government responsibilities. At present its revenue is some £6,000 to £7,000 a year. Steps for the establishment of a permanent form of local authority are being taken. This body will be elected on a wide franchise and will have a larger membership and wider powers and duties than the temporary one. An area of colony land of some 27 square miles immediately adjacent to the island of St. Mary and comprising the former British Kombo is at present administered under the Protectorate Ordinance, but proposals to establish a local government body on colony lines for this area are under consideration.

**(b) Protectorate**

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the protectorate by the Anglo-French Commission in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the protectorate into closer relationship with the government of the Gambia.

The Protectorate Ordinance, 1935, empowers the Governor to divide the protectorate into administrative divisions, districts and sub-districts, and to alter or vary the boundaries of
such areas and to approve the appointment of a head chief, deputy head chief or sub-chief and to remove or suspend them from office. A head chief or sub-chief may appoint or remove headmen. There are at present five divisions each in charge of a commissioner. These are Kombo (North and St. Mary) (area, 107 square miles; two districts with population of 16,014); South Bank (area, 1,153 square miles; 14 districts, with population of 58,317); MacCarthy Island (area, 959 square miles; eight districts with population of 47,866); Upper River (area, 790 square miles; four districts with population of 48,331); and North Bank (area, 996 square miles; eight districts with population of 45,579). In addition to a total population estimated at 216,107, approximately 20,000 farmers from the adjoining French territory immigrate for the ground-nut farming season.

The Native Authority Ordinance, 1933, provides for the appointment of a chief or native council or group of natives as a native authority. The membership of the 36 native authorities consists in all cases of the district heads as presidents, together with their village heads and advisers in council. Since 1944 there has been an annual conference of the protectorate chiefs which may be the forerunner of an eventual protectorate council. At these conferences matters relating to the protectorate are explained to the chiefs, and there is free discussion of any topic of interest.

The Protectorate Treasuries Ordinance, 1945, permits the formation of group or district treasuries managed by finance committees appointed by the native authorities.

The Senior Commissioner exercises a general supervision of the work of the commissioners and performs the functions exercised elsewhere by a Secretary of Native Affairs.

RELIGION

The people of the colony and protectorate are predominantly Mohammedan though in the protectorate there are several pagan enclaves consisting mostly of Jolas and Fulas. The Christians are almost entirely confined to Bathurst where, according to the 1944 census of Bathurst, there are approximately 3,000 Christians out of a population of 21,000. These Christians are composed of Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Methodists, and a mission for each of these denominations has its headquarters in the town.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The currency is British West African silver, alloy and nickel-bronze coins and British West African currency notes for 20s. and 10s. Coins that are legal tender in the United Kingdom under the Coinage Acts of 1870 and 1891 are also legal tender in the Gambia. There is one bank in Bathurst: The Bank of British West Africa, Ltd.

A Government Savings Bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st December, 1945, £98,000 deposited by 5,800 persons.

COMMUNICATIONS

There are sea communications with Europe and other parts of West Africa, but at the beginning of 1946 these were still affected by war conditions and were under Ministry of War Transport control. Arrivals and departures have not yet been put on a regular weekly or monthly basis.

On the other hand there has been much development in air communications. At the beginning of 1946 the British Overseas Airways Corporation were operating a service three times a week north, and three times a week south, between the United Kingdom and the West African colonies. Plans for a U.K.-South American service via Bathurst were under consideration at the beginning of 1946.

Bathurst has a first class flying-boat base which is used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation transatlantic Boeing services during the winter months.

Internal communication is conducted chiefly by water-borne craft, the Gambia river forming an unrivalled highway for 300 miles. The Government maintains a service of river steamers which normally run weekly during the trading season and fortnightly or monthly at other times of the year.

Cable and Wireless, Limited, own and operate the cable station at Bathurst, whence submarine cables connect the colony with West Africa and countries all over the world.

Bathurst wireless station, which has a range of approximately 1,000 miles, communicates with ships at sea and the important town of Dakar in the French Senegal. Wireless stations are also established at Kunta-ur, Georgetown and Basse, and a regular service is maintained between these inland towns and Bathurst.

A central battery telephone system is employed in the town of Bathurst, and in direct connection with Cape St. Mary. A telephone line between Kunta-ur, Georgetown and Bansang is under construction.

There are no railways. A laterite metalled road connects Bathurst with Cape St. Mary and Fajara on the coast about 10 miles from Bathurst, crossing Oyster Creek at Denton Bridge. At Mile Six a similar road leads by Kanifin to Brikama, 16½ miles. Another road goes from Kanifin to Sukuta, 3½ miles. The remainder of the road system consists of a secondary road on each bank of the river to Basse, with feeder roads to various wharf towns on the river. These secondary roads are usable in the dry season only.

Motor cars are used in Bathurst and its vicinity throughout the year and in parts of the protectorate during the dry season.

There is no direct parcel post scheme at present with foreign countries. All parcels are forwarded through the medium of the General Post Office, London, a small additional charge being made for onward transmission.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Medical and Health

Medical facilities in the Gambia are based on two general hospitals, one at Bathurst and one at Bansang. A smaller hospital also operates at Bwiam. Supplementing these are a health centre at Basse, a mobile team which undertakes a regular weekly circuit in South Bank division, and 14 dispensaries situated throughout the protectorate. Maternity and infant welfare work remains chiefly centred in Bathurst, but antenatal and infant welfare clinics are in popular operation at Bakau, Sukuta and Brikama in Kombo North and South Bank divisions, at Basse and to a lesser extent at Georgetown in conjunction with Bansang hospital.

All but Basse and Georgetown are supervised by a welfare sister.

The health service is also chiefly centred in Bathurst, with African inspectors posted to various strategic points in the protectorate.
The staffs of both services have been considerably augmented and are now in training as part of the major development schemes projected.

**Education**

There is an Education Department under the Director of Education who now has the assistance of a lady education officer. The appointment of an education officer for the protectorate has been approved.

In Bathurst all primary schools were reorganised during 1945 and became Government schools, and all teachers therein became Government teachers. The schools, which had previously been co-educational, are now divided into boys' and girls' primary schools, and infants were separated and housed in three new infants' schools. The reorganised schools are divided into three groups: Anglican-Methodist boys' primary, girls' primary and infant schools; Roman Catholic boys' primary, girls' primary and infant schools; Mohammedan boys' primary, which still admits a few girls' and infants' schools.

A primary schools management committee functions in an advisory capacity, while the actual management of each group of schools is in the hands of a sub-committee on which the particular religious authority concerned has a 50 per cent. representation. The total number of scholars on the roll of these schools at the end of 1945 was 2,100.

In Bathurst also there are four secondary schools, two Methodist high schools, one for boys and one for girls, and two Roman Catholic secondary schools, one for boys and one for girls. The total number of pupils in these schools at the end of 1945 was 320. The control of these schools is still in the hands of the missions concerned but Government has now assumed responsibility for payment of European and African staffs under agreed conditions.

In the protectorate there is a Government boarding school at Georgetown in MacCarthy Island which draws pupils from the various divisions. In this school, which had previously only given elementary education, middle classes are gradually being added and there will be two in 1946. These and a vocational class, which it is hoped will be added in 1947, will train protectorate boys for posts in the newly organised native administrations. The total number of pupils on the roll at the end of 1945 was 130. Apart from the above school the only other schools in the protectorate so far are mission ones. The Roman Catholic mission has two elementary schools, one assisted and one unassisted, in Upper River division, totalling 50 pupils approximately. In the same division the Anglican mission runs two small unassisted elementary schools and one unassisted school for boys of various standards who have emigrated from Bathurst. Government is planning the progressive institution of local administration schools in the various divisions, beginning in 1946.

The reorganisation scheme for primary schools in Bathurst has been made possible by a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare Act funds, and direct Government expenditure on primary and secondary education in the town now amounts to approximately £15,162 annually.

**Labour**

The Labour Department was created in 1939 and provision is made in its establishment for the appointment of a substantive labour officer. Only once (1942-43), however, have the services of a full-time labour officer been available.

The employment offered in the Gambia is largely of a casual nature, particularly during the groundnut trade season when protectorate farmers migrate to Bathurst in search of work. This type of labour does not lend itself to trade unionism and the main function of the Labour Office in its present stage is in hearing and dealing with individual complaints. Claims under the workmen's compensation legislation are usually taken up by the labour officer on behalf of illiterates, and he also advises on and implements the various labour ordinances in force. In addition, the department acts as a labour exchange; undertakes the trade testing of artisans; and administers a technical training centre. A European technical training officer is expected to arrive in the Gambia in 1946.

**GIBRALTAR**

**SITUATION AND AREA**

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long, high mountain called "The Rock," and a very flat sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the "North Front." Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 24 miles, and its greatest breadth ¼ of a mile. Its area is 1¾ square miles.
CLIMATE

The general climate of Gibraltar is mild and temperate, though somewhat hot and oppressive during the months of July and August. The rainy season is spread over the period from September to May; the annual average rainfall is 35 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called "The Bay of Gibraltar," which is about 4 or 5 miles across and affords good anchorage for shipping passing through the Straits. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock form an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea. At the northern end, between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea, lies the North Front, on which a landing ground was completed during the course of the war. From the northern end, the Rock runs southward to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the Fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lines lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only \( \frac{3}{4} \) by \( \frac{1}{2} \) mile. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden called "The Alameda." The civil population of the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south sides of the South mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being taken up with barracks, hospitals, etc., for the Military and the Navy. The Naval harbour is part of the west side of the Rock. It is formed by three separate moles known as the "North," "Detached," and "South" moles. The North Mole runs westward from Devil's Tongue for about 2,900 feet and then southwards, giving a total length of over a mile. The South Mole projects into the sea for a distance of 3,660 feet in a north-west direction. The Detached Mole, 2,717 feet long, is so situated between these two moles as to form a breakwater and leave two means of exit and entrance. The harbour contains a water area of 440 acres. There are three large graving docks for Naval purposes and a small dock which is available for merchant vessels of light draught.

HISTORY

Gibraltar was known to the ancients as Mons Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules, the other being Mount Abyla, or Apes Hill, on the opposite coast of Africa. It was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain.

In 711 the Moorish Chief Tarik-Ibn-Zeyad landed on the Rock, and gave it the name of Gibel-Tarik, or Mountain of Tarik, of which the name of Gibraltar is a corruption. It remained in Moorish hands until 1309, when it was seized by the Spaniards. In 1333 it was again taken by the Moors, but was wrested from the Moslem dynasty in 1462 and reverted to the dominion of Spain.

In 1704, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to retake Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

CONSTITUTION

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 12th September, 1922, by a Governor aided by an Executive Council composed of four official and three unofficial members. The power of legislation is vested in the Governor who is also the General Officer Commanding the Garrison. It was announced on 3rd November, 1945, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies was prepared to agree to the establishment of a Legislative Council in Gibraltar as soon as circumstances permit.

POPULATION (CIVILIAN)

| Census, 1921 | : | 18,540 |
| Census, 1931 | : | 17,613 |

ADMINISTRATION

The revenue of the colony is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, licence duties and fees and import duties.

The present Customs Tariff includes import duties on wines, liquors, spirits, including perfumed spirits, and tobacco with Empire preferential rates, and on motor spirit.

The management of the drainage, water supply, etc., is in the hands of the City Council, a body which, by recent legislation enacted in 1945, now contains for the first time in its history a popularly elected majority. Their receipts for 1944 were £159,709, their expenditure £124,787 and their debt on 31st December, 1944, £71,269.

Civilians wishing to reside in the Colony for longer than one month must obtain the authority of the Resettlement Board, a body set up primarily to handle the repatriation of Gibraltarians evacuated during the war.

RELIGION

The large majority of the civilian population are Roman Catholics.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The legal tender of the colony is composed of local Government notes and United Kingdom silver and copper coinage.

Colonial Government currency notes were in circulation to the value of £1,025,227 at 31st December, 1945.

The issue is governed by the Currency Note Ordinance and is of the following denominations:

- £5
- £1
- 10s.

There are three private banks, which offer all normal banking facilities, viz.:

- Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial & Overseas). Head Office : 54, Lombard Street, London, E.C.3.
- The Credit Foncier d'Algerie et de Tunisie. Head Office : 43, Rue Cambon, Paris. London Branch : 62, Bishopsgate, E.C.2.
- A. L. Galliano of Gibraltar.

A Government Savings Bank was founded in 1882. On 31st December, 1945, deposits by 9,066 depositors amounted to £846,411.

COMMUNICATIONS

(i) Postal.—Air mail correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom three times a week. Transmission time is two days.

Ordinary correspondence, unless superscribed "by sea route," is received from and despatched
to the United Kingdom by the overland route via Spain and France daily. Time in transit is between four and six days.

Air mail services exist to most countries and facilities are being extended as world conditions improve.

A daily service is maintained with the continent of Europe and North Africa.

(ii) Telegraphs.—The Government land lines connecting Gibraltar with Spain are worked by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., who have a station at Gibraltar. Telegrams are accepted for all parts of the world.

(iii) Telephones.—The telephone system is under the control of the City Council. Telephone communication is at present restricted to the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Spanish Morocco and Tangier.

The local Naval and Military departments have their own lines which are connected with the City Council scheme.

(iv) Roads.—The upkeep of roads is in the hands of the City Council in whom they are vested by law.

There are no railways or tramways in Gibraltar.

(v) Shipping.—Owing to its geographical position, Gibraltar was extensively used before the war as a port of call and a coaling station by vessels of every nationality. The voyage between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom takes about four and a half days.

There is a daily steamer service between Gibraltar and the town of Algeciras on the opposite side of the Bay as well as a weekly service with Tangier.

(vi) Air.—B.O.A.C. operate a weekly service between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom via Lisbon.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education has been compulsory since 1917. Government assumed full responsibility for education in the Colony in 1944 on the repatriation of the civil population. A Director of Education has been appointed and fully qualified teachers, both religious and lay, have been recruited from the United Kingdom on Government contracts. There are at present two secondary and nine primary and infants schools in operation with a total number of pupils at 31st December, 1945, of 1,759. Government expenditure on education in 1945 amounted to £23,112 whilst estimated expenditure in 1946 is £53,191.

The medical services of the colony have been completely reorganised as the result of recommendations made by a committee appointed to consider the matter in 1943. One of the most important of the committee's recommendations, the establishment of an ante- and post-natal clinic in charge of a medical officer with the special qualifications required, has already been put into effect, and the King George V (Chest) Hospital under the charge of a medical officer with specialist qualifications in diseases of the lung has recently been opened.

A newly-appointed Social Welfare Officer has assumed duty and a Commissioner of Labour has been appointed.
