TRINIDAD

SITUATION AND AREA

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is 50 miles, its average breadth 37 miles, and its area 1,862 square miles. It is separated from S. America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, and Venezuela is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order-in-Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st January, 1889.

CLIMATE

The climate of Trinidad is tropical and may be divided into two seasons, a dry season from January to the middle of May, with an average rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December, with an average of 8 inches per month. The coolest months of the year are December to April. The average temperature during the day is 84 and during the night 74. The total rainfall in 1945, from records taken at 121 stations, was 71·56 inches. The climate is healthy and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided reasonable precautions are taken.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising to 3,085 feet; the central range runs south-west from Manzilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao and coconuts, which are its staples.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain, situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria.

HISTORY

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of
the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Roume de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

**CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION**

The government is administered by a Governor with an Executive Council consisting at present of eight members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, six nominated unofficial members and nine elected members. Trinidad is divided into seven electoral districts, six returning one member and one returning two members. Tobago forms the seventh electoral district and returns one member.

**POPULATION**

The population of Trinidad and Tobago on 31st December, 1945, was estimated to be 558,045. The population of the principal towns at 31st December, 1945, was estimated to be:

- Port of Spain: 107,499
- San Fernando: 19,405
- Arima: 6,867
- Princes Town: 6,797

The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French and Spanish. There is also a large number of East Indians, totalling 137,583. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

In 1903 an Ordinance provided for the issue of Government currency notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, and $1,000 have been issued, but the $1,000 notes were withdrawn and destroyed on 21st December, 1934. The total value in circulation at 31st December, 1945, amounted to $22,602,139·50.

Government savings banks are established in 43 districts with a head office in Port of Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1944, was 74,571, with deposits amounting to $7,502,975.

In addition to the above banks there is the Trinidad Co-operative bank, an institution established in 1914, for the encouragement of thrift.

**Communications**

**Railways and Roads**

The railway system consists of a total length of 118 miles, of which the first line opened in 1897 runs from Port of Spain to Arima and Sangre Grande along the southern foothills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the coast, the length of the line being 29 miles.

The line to San Fernando and Siparia, 44 miles long, leaves the former at St. Joseph Junction. The first section to Couva was opened in 1880, extended to San Fernando in 1882, and the further extension to Siparia was opened in 1913.

The Guaracara line from Marabella Junction to Princes Town, 10 miles long, was opened in 1884.

The railway has three regular trains daily each way, between Port of Spain and all termini. In addition, frequent suburban trains are run serving the residential districts of Tunapuna, St. Augustine and San Juan.

Regular goods trains are provided on all lines, and in addition, special sugar cane trains supply each sugar factory daily during the sugar crop season.

The Railway Ancillary Services provide motor omnibus connections from the termini to the coast in all directions—Blanchisseuse, Matelot, Toco, Biche, Mayaro, Guayaguayare, Moruga, Cedros and Point Fortin. A number of inland areas are also served by motor omnibuses. The service maintained permits residents from any of the outlying points to travel by omnibus and rail from their homes to Port of Spain and back the same day.

The Railway Ancillary Goods Service is operated in conjunction with the railway, and collection or delivery is arranged as required. Regular goods services are run by road to Blanchisseuse and Cedros. Goods services are also operated in Tobago.

The railway is equipped with telegraph and telephone communication throughout the system, and telegrams are accepted for transmission between any two stations, with arrangements for delivery within a reasonable radius of the receiving station.
The total number of passengers carried during 1944 was 10,267,104, and the volume of goods transported was 693,089 tons. The total receipts from the railway, telegraph and road services in 1944 amounted to $2,903,072.

The city of Port of Spain is served by a tramway system, which is gradually being replaced by trolley buses, operated by the Port of Spain City Council. Motor omnibuses supply the transport needs of the residents in the suburban areas.

The roads are divided into main and local roads. The former and 58·26 per cent. of the latter are under the control of the Public Works Department. The other local roads amounting to 552 miles are under local road boards. The main roads, with a total mileage of 1,070 miles are made up of 597 miles metalled or gravelled and sealed, 184 miles metalled, 154 miles gravelled and 135 miles natural soil roads. The local roads in districts where there are no local road boards comprise 771 miles and are made up of 160 miles metalled or gravelled and oiled, 93 miles metalled, 256 miles gravelled and 262 miles natural soil roads. In addition there are many miles of Crown traces in charge of the wardens.

There are several garages in Port of Spain where motor cars can be engaged to convey passengers to any part of the colony. At most of the railway stations motor cars can be hired to carry passengers to outlying parts. Motor omnibuses also ply on the main roads, and in some of the suburbs of Port of Spain.

**MUNICIPALITIES**

In 1914 Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1931 was 14,287.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1931 census, 5,072).

The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs for the year ended 31st December, 1945, was $707,531, the expenditure $873,616, and the total debt $431,396.

The total municipal revenue of the city of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1944, was $1,364,041, the expenditure $1,437,054, and the total debt $1,351,270.

**TOBAGO**

**HISTORY**

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the "Darling" and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants,
who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuylar, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commender Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

**Situation and Area**

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. latitude and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. longitude, distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 116 square miles, or 74,392 acres, of which about 42,000 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

**General Description**

Tobago is a ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, livestock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1945 was $1,098,783, made up as follows:

- Cocoa: $227,078
- Coconuts: $97
- Copra: $533,567
- Other products: $318,041

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about eight miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

**Communications**

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a coastal steamer service, provided by the Government, also by an air service provided by the British West Indian Airways, Ltd.

The island possesses a fair mileage of motor roads and is served by the railway omnibuses with daily services to all districts. Connecting omnibuses are provided in conjunction with the coastal steamers.

**Education**

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian and Methodist bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

**Constitution**

The government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order-in-Council of 7th February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order-in-Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order-in-Council of 20th October, 1898, the Order-in-Council of 17th November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future ordinances of the legislature of the colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the legislature should be able to enact special and local ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the colony.

This Order-in-Council was brought into effect from 1st January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on 8th December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.

### UGANDA

#### SITUATION AND AREA

The territories comprising the Uganda Protectorate are surrounded by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Kenya, Tanganyika Territory, Rwanda-Urundi (under Belgian mandate) and the Belgian Congo. The protectorate extends from about parallel 1° south latitude to the northern limits of the navigable waters of the Albert Nile at Nimule. The eastern boundary runs from Mount Zulia on the Sudan border along the Turkana escarpment to the crater of Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and thence follows the Malawa and the Sio rivers into the north-eastern waters of Lake Victoria. The outstanding features on the western side are the Nile-Congo watershed, Lake Albert, the River Semliki, the Ruwenzori Range (16,794 feet), and Lake Edward. The area of the protectorate is approximately 93,981 square miles, of which 13,680 square miles are water.

#### CLIMATE

The climate when compared with that of some tropical countries is not unpleasant, but there are parts of the country which are hot and dry and which, for various reasons, are more trying to non-indigenous people. The Nile Valley, which lies about 2,000 feet above sea level, is amongst the hottest parts of the country and is generally less healthy than the higher regions between Lakes Victoria, Albert and Edward. Europeans find the climate congenial in Buganda and the greater part of the western areas, where most of the country is over 4,000 feet above sea level rising to 5,000 feet and over in certain districts. There is perpetual snow on the Ruwenzori Range.

Climatic conditions are not uniform, but, except in the north-east, the climate on the whole is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the 49 years to 1944 at Entebbe being mean maximum, 78·6° F.; mean minimum, 63·7° F. Average daily sunshine 6·12 hours. The lowest rainfall for 1945 was recorded at Kikagati Mine, Ankole (Western province), which registered 22·79 inches, the highest (95·36 inches) being recorded at Lwazim-irule Komé Island, Lake Victoria.

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February. The pleasantest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the most trying, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to those immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes are more in evidence and malarial infections more commonly occur.

#### GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The protectorate forms part of the central African tableland, the elevation varying from about 3,720 feet above sea level at Lake Victoria to about 3,300 to the west of Hoima and Masindi, where there is a sudden fall of 1,200 feet to Lake Albert. To the north of Lake Albert, 2,028 feet, there is a gradual descent along the valley of the Nile, while Kabale in the extreme south-west is at an altitude of 6,400 feet. Central Uganda is a densely populated country of flattened hills and valleys, lakes and swamps. It is fertile and capable of producing a large variety of crops, chiefly cotton, coffee, sugar, tobacco and rubber. The principal native food crops are plantains, millet and sweet potatoes; maize, rice, sugar-cane, chillies, yams, ground-nuts, sim-sim and a little wheat are also grown. Western Uganda is an elevated, mountainous area, part of which is short grass land, with a healthy climate where European fruits and vegetables can be grown. Big game is plentiful and there are areas of dense forest. North-eastern Uganda, towards the borders of the Sudan, is a dry and arid area, sparsely populated by semi-nomadic tribes.

Uganda is essentially an agricultural country. Except for the Karamojong in the north-east and the Bahima in the short grass lands of the southwest, who live chiefly by cattle raising and trading, the population is almost entirely engaged in agriculture. Cotton lint and cotton seed represent over 80 per cent. of the value of the total exports, and cotton is entirely a native grown crop, so that the agricultural production of the protectorate is almost completely in the hands of African cultivators. There are a few non-native estates, those owned by Europeans being engaged in the production of coffee, rubber, and tea, while the sugar and sisal estates are in the hands of Asians. Alienation of land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended.

There are indications of the existence of a wide range of minerals including gold, tin, wolfram, tantalite, bismuth and mica. There are considerable deposits of salt in the Katwe and Kasenyi crater lakes, and its production and distribution is a long-established native industry.

One hundred and ninety-four cotton ginneries, two sugar factories and a distillery for the manufacture of power alcohol have been established; there are tobacco factories at Kampala and Jinja, and coffee curing factories at Kampala, Masaka and Bubulu. Other industries are as yet in their infancy but the resources of water power in different parts of the protectorate are considerable and will doubtless play their part in the future economic history of the country.

The headquarters of the Uganda administration are at Entebbe, and the chief commercial towns are Kampala and Jinja; all three are on or near the north shore of Lake Victoria and all are supplied with electricity.

No part of the protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Kigezi in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile Valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria can be contracted throughout the year.
With reasonable care, European infants appear to thrive well in the greater part of the country, provided they are kept free from such tropical infections as malaria. Ordinarily European children are not retained longer than over 6 or 7 years of age but this is mainly due to difficulties in respect of schooling.

Sleeping sickness, which proved such a scourge to the country in 1902 and the years following and necessitated the evacuation of the natives from the islands in Lake Victoria, and from the shores of the great lakes and rivers, is now well under control. During 1921 and 1922 the island population was to a great extent restored and many of the islands were successfully reopened. A few cases still occur, usually amongst persons living in contact with tsetse fly.

Active measures against all endemic and epidemic diseases are being taken by the medical and administrative authorities, and the country's rapidly becoming healthier, especially in towns and closely developed areas.

The most important native language is Luganda, belonging to the Bantu group, while Swahili, in a debased form, is widely understood. In the northeast, Nilotic languages are used.

**History**

The countries that now make up the protectorate did not become known to Europe until the journey of Speke and Grant in search of the sources of the Nile. In 1862, coming from the south, they were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala, and were astonished to find themselves among an organised and comparatively civilised people. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages—the discovery of the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864 and Egyptian plans for the annexation of much of present-day Uganda followed. Under such famous governors as Baker, Gordon and Emin, the Egyptian flag flew in the Nile district from 1872 to 1889.

Stanley visited Uganda in 1875 and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa's dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed in 1879 by French Roman Catholics. Mutesa died in 1884 and was succeeded by his son Mwanga.

Christianity had meanwhile made headway, but Mwanga proved unfavourable to it, and for his father's tolerance substituted persecution and even massacre of the missionaries' adherents. In 1888 his people turned on him and he fled to the south of Lake Victoria; but, the Arab traders and native Mohammedans gaining the upper hand, the missionaries and native Christians were also driven out. In the same year control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company, and when the Anglo-German agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the company's influence in Uganda. He found Mwanga recently restored with the help of his fugitive Christian subjects, and concluded a treaty with him within a few days of his arrival.

In 1891 Lugard visited the western limits of the British sphere and, at the south end of Lake Albert, found a remnant of Emin's Egyptian (Sudanese) troops. These he enlisted and brought into Buganda. In January, 1892, soon after his return to Kampala, war broke out between the Protestant and Roman Catholic factions. The latter were defeated and fled taking Mwanga with them. Peace was concluded and Mwanga restored in March, 1892.

Meanwhile the company, crippled by the cost of occupation, gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda, and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future governance. On 1st April, 1893, he assumed on behalf of the British Government the obligations and responsibilities of the company in Buganda and the Union Jack replaced the company's flag at the fort, which may still be seen on Old Kampala Hill. The formal establishment of a protectorate, but over Mwanga's kingdom only, was deferred until 18th June, 1894. Meanwhile Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler, Kabarega, driven out. In 1896 the protectorate was extended to most of the other regions, which are now included within the present Uganda, and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory, Mwanga's kingdom, which is the present Buganda Province, being referred to as Buganda.

In July, 1897, Mwanga fled from his country for the third and last time, and in the following August his infant son, Daudi Chwa, the father of the present Kabaka (or ruler) of Buganda, was proclaimed in his stead. A few months later the very existence of the protectorate was threatened by a mutiny of the Sudanese troops. They occupied Luba's fort in Busoga and murdered their commander, Captain Thruston. Indian troops were hurried to Uganda but the position was not restored until February, 1898.

Since then there is little but peaceful progress to record. Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government in 1900 as Special Commissioner to settle the country, and concluded an agreement with the Kabaka and people of Buganda, which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown and the ownership of the land. The next year similar agreements were made with the chiefs in Toro and Ankole. Administration has since been extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganised tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" have been followed wherever and whenever it was possible, as in the "agreement districts." In 1903 the eastern highlands of the protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony, and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of frontiers with the Sudan, the Belgian Congo and German East Africa, now the Tanganyika Territory. In 1903 the superintendence of the protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign to the Colonial Office. In the war of 1914-18 the population, of all races, remained devotedly loyal and played a great part in the East African campaign. Since then progress, both material and cultural, has continued. During the second world war Uganda, like other British territories, gave of its best in manpower, money and production in the common war effort.

**Constitution**

By the Uganda Order-in-Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, both consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists
of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, and the Resident Buganda (ex-officio members), and such other persons holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such other persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. There are no unofficial members at present, but the appointment of one is under consideration. There is one official member.

It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor, Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture and Director of Education (ex-officio members), with official and unofficial members as in the case of the Executive Council. There are seven unofficial members (two European, two Indian and three African), but this number is shortly to be increased to nine. There is at present one official member.

The Native Government of Buganda has certain rights of internal legislation granted by agreement. The King, or Kabaka, who is accorded the title of "His Highness," rules the Baganda people with the advice of the Governor and of a native council known as the Lukiko, which also has judicial functions.

**EAST AFRICAN GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE**

An account of this standing conference and its constitution is given in the introduction to Part II.

### POPULATION

Estimated population, December, 1944:

| Europeans | Males | 1,461 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
|           | Females | 1,092 |
| Asiatics | 27,573 |
| Africans | 3,926,528 |
| **Total** | **3,956,654** |

The African population is divisible into three racial groups—Bantu, Nilotic and Half-Hamite. The most numerous are the Bantu, comprising the Baganda, Banyoro, Batoro, Banyankole, Basoga, Bachiga and Bagishu and other smaller tribes or sections south and west of the Victoria Nile, and in certain districts in the Eastern Province. To the north and west are the principal Niloticsthe Lango, Acholi, Alur, Lugbara and Madi. The Teso people of the Eastern Province constitute the most important Half-Hamite unit; the others are scattered over a wide area adjacent to Kenya, from the Sudan boundary in the extreme north-east to Mount Elgon. Mention should also be made of the interesting Bahima and the allied peoples of the Western Province. The ruling families of Buganda, Bunyoro, Toro and Ankole are descended from Hima stock.

### ADMINISTRATION

The protectorate is divided into three provinces—Buganda, Eastern and Western. Buganda is on a different footing from the remainder, since, under the 1900 agreement, the Kabaka exercises in Buganda direct rule over his people "to whom he shall administer justice through the Lukiko, or native council, and through others of his officers in the manner approved by Her Majesty's Government."

All chiefs are appointed by the Kabaka with the approval of the Governor, and the Kabaka, with the Governor's consent, has the power to make laws governing his people in Buganda.

In other provinces, native administrations are recognised in stages of development varying with the advancement of the tribes. There are native rulers in Ankole, Toro and Bunyoro, each with his council, and native administrations in other districts or tribal areas, the councils being composed of the county chiefs, their sub-chiefs and elders. The councils have no legislative powers, except that, subject to the Governor's consent, they may alter native law by resolution and fix penalties for its breach. The councils are permanently in session to deal with magisterial and routine matters, and submit to the District Commissioner, or to the native ruler, their views on such subjects as:

(a) Proposed alterations to tribal customary law.

(b) Matters affecting the expenditure of native administration funds for the benefit of the tribes.

(c) Agricultural and veterinary development and labour questions.

(d) Food crops and famine.

Estimates are compiled annually for all native administrations and submitted to the Governor for approval.

### RELIGION

The Protestant and Roman Catholic churches have been working in the protectorate for over 60 years and now have about one and a quarter million adherents between them. There are also several hundreds of thousands of Muslims. The remainder of the population is pagan at heart, though the desire for education brings many more into the orbit of the missions each year.

### CURRENCY AND BANKING

The currency is the same as that of Kenya. Banking facilities are afforded by the National Bank of India, Ltd., with branches at Entebbe, Kampala, and Jinja, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., with branches at Kampala and Jinja, and Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial, and Overseas), with branches at Kampala and Jinja.

### COMMUNICATIONS

**Postal**

The Uganda Posts and Telegraphs Department is amalgamated with those of Kenya and Tanganyika under the control of the Postmaster-General at Nairobi.

Uganda is in telegraphic communication with Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam by land lines, and thence by cable with Great Britain and all parts of the world through the system of Cable & Wireless, Ltd., and also by the company's wireless circuit to Great Britain through Nairobi. All important centres within the protectorate are also connected by telegraph. The radio telephone service with the United Kingdom is also available to certain places in Uganda, communication being by trunk land line to Nairobi thence through the wireless channel of Cable & Wireless, Ltd.

For tariffs within the Empire, see Kenya.
The total mileage of telegraph and telephone pole route at the end of 1945 was 1,616, and the wire mileage 3,762. Telephone exchanges connected with the main Uganda trunk system are worked at Bombo, Busembatia, Busia, Entebbe, Iganga, Jinja, Kaliro, Kampala, Kamuli, Lugazi, Masaka, Mbale, Mpigi and Tororo. Other telephone exchanges at which the trunk service is restricted to certain offices, exist at Bukakata, Butiaba, Masindi, Masindi Port and Soroti.

Railways

The protectorate is separated by about 500 miles from the nearest point on the east coast of Africa. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the colony of Kenya, transport was exceedingly difficult before the construction of the "Uganda Railway" from Mombasa to the northeast corner of Lake Victoria, which the Imperial Government decided in 1895 to undertake. This railway at the end of 1901 had covered the whole 584 miles separating Mombasa from Kisumu on Victoria Nyanza, which was the terminus of the railway until recent years.

There is a lake steamer service connecting Entebbe, Port Bell (Kampala), with Kisumu and the other ports on Lake Victoria. Steamers ply also on Lake Kioga and on Lake Albert (connected by a road service), and on the Albert Nile as far north as Nimule. All these services are maintained by the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours Administration.

A railway, 62 miles long, from Jinja to Namasagali on the Victoria Nile, giving access to the waterways of Lake Kioga, was completed in 1912, and one from Port Bell on Lake Victoria to Kampala, a distance of 7½ miles, was opened for public traffic in 1915.

Since the 1914-18 war considerable railway development has taken place, and the main line of the Kenya and Uganda railway, leaving the original line at Nakuru, now extends into the Eastern Province of Uganda to join the Jinja-Namasagali railway at Mbulamuti, and so places Uganda in direct communication with the coast. An extension of this line from Tororo, near the Kenya border, to Mbale and Soroti was completed in 1929, and the linking up of Jinja with Kampala—a scheme which involved the bridging of the Victoria Nile at the former place—was completed in the early part of 1931.

Roads

The system of all-weather main roads radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres is maintained by the Public Works Department, which has a road mileage of 2,457 under its control. A system of roads in the Western Province establishes connection between the tin mines and the Kagera River steamship service, taps the resources of the Rutshuru area of the Belgian Congo for that service, and links up direct the district headquarters in the west of the protectorate. About 5,300 miles of excellent roads are also kept up by the native administrations. Motor transport, in consequence of these facilities, has reached an advanced stage of development in the protectorate.

Air Services

Landing grounds are kept up at Entebbe, Tororo, Masindi, Gulu, Soroti, Lira, Arua and Moroto. Landing facilities for seaplanes exist at Entebbe, Port Bell, Jinja and Butiaba. There is no accommodation in Uganda for housing aircraft.

The Cairo to South Africa mail and passenger service of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, is operated by flying boats which call twice weekly at Port Bell for Kampala on both northward and southward journeys. In addition a service of land machines has been recently instituted calling at Nairobi, and there is a thrice weekly local air service from Entebbe to Nairobi, calling at Kisumu and connecting Uganda with the air services in neighbouring territories.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Medical

Large African, Asian and European hospitals are provided by Government in Kampala, the commercial capital of the protectorate.

Medical officers are stationed in every district headquarters and have charge of a hospital and a chain of dispensaries and aid posts, situated in the more densely populated areas. These subsidiary centres are regularly visited by the medical officers.

Nursing sisters are attached to most of the district hospitals, and, in addition to tutorial and supervisory duties, conduct ante-natal and child welfare clinics at regular intervals in the larger dispensaries.

Hospital accommodation in most districts has been considerably improved in recent years.

There is a full time medical officer of health in Kampala. Responsibility for public health is vested in the medical officer in each district, assisted in some of the more populous areas by a health inspector.

Schools for the training of African medical officers, medical orderlies, health inspectors, dispensers and nurses are attached to the African Hospital in Kampala. Two mission hospitals in the same station train midwives. The extension of training facilities for nursing orderlies, nurses and midwives in the districts is contemplated and the establishment of three new schools for this purpose is nearing completion.

Education

Education was at first entirely and still is mainly in the hands of the various missionary societies, who receive grants from the Protectorate Government. Their efforts have, for some years past, been supplemented by Government. The total Protectorate Government grants to African education in 1944 were £184,624. The total number attending schools in 1944 was approximately 380,000, of whom roughly 100,000 were within the aided system; the total Government expenditure on education in 1944 was £242,664. Makerere College, Kampala, is an East African institute for higher education, moving towards University status. It is an interterritorial foundation, in whose support and direction all the East African governments take part.

Labour and Welfare

A Labour Department has been re-established, and with the passing of the Uganda Employment Ordinance will shortly be enlarged. As part of the plans for post-war development, it is hoped to set up a Department of Social Welfare and Public Relations.

Further information regarding social services may be found in the annual report of the colony and in the annual departmental reports.
**Public Revenue and Expenditure**

The revenue is principally derived from income tax, poll taxes, customs duties, cotton tax, trading licences and land rents. The revenue from income tax in 1944 was £322,551, from poll taxes £600,087, and from customs duties £536,505. There has been no grant-in-aid from the British Government since 1914–15. The Uganda Loan, 1932 (£2,235,600) was floated in January, 1932, and Uganda Loan, 1937 (£614,400), was floated in April, 1939. The unit of currency is the East African shilling.
