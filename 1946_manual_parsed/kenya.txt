Communication between the coastal ports of the protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co. and Holland’Africa Line.

Railways, Rivers and Harbours

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line, together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda, should be controlled by an Inter-Colonial Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one
unofficial member from each territory (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway. The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

By an amending Order-in-Council, dated 13th August, 1935, the High Commissioner for Transport now consists of (a) the Officer Administering the Government of Kenya; and (b) the Officer Administering the Government of Uganda acting, save where specifically otherwise provided therein, jointly or in conference.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches open to traffic at the end of 1944, is 1,625 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings.

The Railway Marine consists of the Lake Victoria, Lake Kioga, Lake Albert and River Nile flotillas.

Their respective strengths are as follows:

Lake Victoria:
- 3 steamers, total displacement 3,646 tons.
- 4 tugs and 2 launches.
- 2 motor vessels (Kagera River and Kavirondo Gulf services).
- 37 lighters, total capacity 4,315 tons.

Lake Kioga:
- 3 sternwheel steamers, total displacement 468 tons.
- 20 lighters, total capacity 2,160 tons.

Lake Albert and River Nile:
- 3 steamers, total displacement 1,106 tons.
- 1 motor vessel.
- 1 launch.
- 10 lighters, total capacity 700 tons.

The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda:

Total expenditure on capital £24,255,938 account at the end of 1944.

Revenue for 1944—
- Railways £4,004,772
- Harbours £748,063

Ordinary working expenditure excluding loan and redemption charges, for 1944—
- Railways £2,448,367
- Harbours £391,636

Number of passengers carried 2,768,767
Goods carried (value in millions) £2,169,750

Total steamer miles (all three services) 1,197,780

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now entirely used by dhows. Kilindini harbour, the port of Mombasa, is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the east coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply. It has been the scene of intensive development during recent years, and some four million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lighterage quay, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 4,000 feet, giving seven berths accommodating ocean-going vessels. The quay is served by 26 electric level-lifting cranes and is equipped with seven transit sheds, three of which are double storied. Stacking ground cranes number nine, including three 5-ton mobile cranes. A 10-ton electric quayside crane is available for heavy lifts. Further cranes are being added. Bulk oil from ships is discharged to tanks ashore at a special jetty. Another jetty, formerly owned by the Magadi Soda Co., has been acquired by the port, together with the sheds and conveyors, and this berth is now used for loading commodities other than soda.

A Harbour Advisory Board, set up under the authority of an Order-in-Council enacted in December, 1927, advises the High Commissioner for Transport on port matters.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana.

The port of Kilifi consists of a land-locked harbour, 30 miles north-east of Mombasa. It offers good anchorage for small vessels, and opens out into the Bandari Ya Wali, a bay about one-and-a-half miles wide, with shallow anchorage. There is a District Commissioner in residence at Kilifi.

The port of Malindi is an open harbour, 60 miles north-east of Mombasa. Ships of any size can anchor off Malindi, but the anchorage is very exposed to the Monsoons. Cotton, sisal, and copra are exported. A District Officer resides at Malindi.

About three miles north of Malindi is the mouth of the Sabaki River. This river, which has recently been bridged about a mile from its mouth, passes through a country of great fertility, but is shallow and only navigable by canoes.

The port of Lamu lies between Lamu and Manda Islands, 140 miles north-east of Mombasa. The town of Lamu, the most important coast town north of Mombasa, is situated on Lamu Island. There is a good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, but the bar carries only 15 feet at low water. The exports are coconuts, copra, rope, mat bags, and some cattle. There is a District Commissioner in residence at Lamu.

Air Services

Air trunk line services operate in East Africa under the jurisdiction of British Overseas Airways Corporation and Air France.

The primary port of call is Eastleigh aerodrome, Nairobi.

Local feeder services are operated in the three East African territories and Zanzibar by East African Airways. These services have only recently recommenced, but regular schedules connect the principal towns.

The three territories are covered by a network of landing grounds, the majority of which are suitable for the local services. Steps are now
being taken to effect improvements at all landing grounds in Kenya to comply with modern specifications.

Roads

There are approximately 8,023 miles of road in Kenya, maintained from public funds. These are classified as bituminous roads, 259 miles; gravel or improved earth roads, 3,249 miles; and earth tracks, 4,515 miles.

The Great North Road passes through Kenya, entering the Colony from Tanganyika at Namanga and passing through Nairobi, Nakuru, and Kisumu, and on to cross the border into Uganda at Busia. Work is now proceeding on this road, and several sections have been completed and opened to traffic, notably the escarpment section from Limuru, 20 miles north-west of Nairobi, down into the Rift Valley, and the Naivasha-Nakuru section. Other sections are at various stages of completion. The standards adopted for this road are as follows:

Twenty-foot bituminised carriageway, with a ruling gradient of 5 per cent. and a minimum curvature of 500 feet. The bridges are constructed with a clear width of 24 feet, and are designed to carry 12 units of the British standard loading, Type A.

Two branch roads from this main route are under construction, and so far one other is under consideration. The branch routes under construction are the Nairobi-Thika road and the Lumbwa-Sotik road. The Nairobi-Thika road has been completed as far as Ruiru, and it is hoped to complete the Ruiru-Thika section during 1946. The extension of this road to serve Nyeri and Nanyuki will be surveyed shortly. The Lumbwa-Sotik road is now complete as far as Jamji, and it is hoped to complete it to Sotik in 1946. The third branch to connect Eldoret and Kitale into this system is under consideration.

Posts and Telegraphs

The post office of the Colony (exclusive of Uganda and Tanganyika which are worked by the Kenya Post Office), received and despatched during 1944, 23,949,700 letters, packets, etc., and 1,039,500 telegrams.

The telegraph and telephone system has 27,371 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda and Tanganyika). The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu (173 miles), Kipini with Witu (13 miles), Mombasa to Tanganyika border (61 miles), Mombasa with Nairobi (335 miles), Voi to Tanganyika border (80 miles), Konza with Magadi (91 miles), Konsa with Machakos (18 miles), Nairobi with Thika (35 miles), Thika with Makuyu (19 miles), Makuyu with Nyeri (58 miles), Nyeri with Nanyuki (32 miles), Nanyuki with Isiolo (69 miles), Nairobi with Kiambu (7 miles), Nairobi with Kijabe (43 miles), Kijabe with Narok (61 miles), Kijabe with Gilgil (39 miles), Gilgil with Thomson's Falls (45 miles), Thomson's Falls with Rumuruti (22 miles), Gilgil with Nakuru (38 miles), Nakuru with Nakuru Junction (5 miles), Nakuru Junction with Kisumu (128 miles), Kisumu with Kakamega (23 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho (19 miles), Kericho with Chemegal (32 miles), Kericho with Kisii (54 miles), Muhoroni with Songhor (10 miles), Kibigori with Eldoret (34 miles), Kisumu to Uganda Border (86 miles), Nakuru Junction with Eldoret (118 miles), Rongai with Lake Solai (21 miles), Maji Waziri with Eldama Ruanda (69 miles), Eldama Ruanda with Moiben (13 miles), Eldama Ruanda Border (29 miles), Taveta with Kitui (43 miles), Kitale with Endebess (11 miles), Kitale with Kiminini (11 miles), Kapsabet with Kakamega (29 miles). Lines also follow all railway routes.

Telegraph communication exists with Uganda and Tanganyika Territory. The Kenya telegraph system is also linked up via the Tanganyika Territory, Nyasaland and Rhodesian systems with the South African service. Communication with the Belgian Congo is maintained through Uganda, with which the Belgian Congo system is linked up.

Radio telegraph stations are operated by the Posts and Telegraphs Department at Nairobi, Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Lodwar, Lokitaung, Kitui, Embu, Kabarnet, Maralal, Lamu and Mombasa.

Aeradio stations with direction-finding facilities are maintained by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., at Nairobi and by the Posts and Telegraphs Department at Kisumu and Mombasa.

Communication between Mombasa and ships at sea is maintained by means of radiotelegraphy operated by Cable and Wireless, Ltd. This Company's cable connects Mombasa with Zanzibar, whence communication is maintained through its system with all parts of the world.

The Company also owns and operates, under licence, the broadcasting station VQ 7 LO, at Nairobi, which transmits simultaneously on wavelengths of 49·5, 350 and 60·61 metres.

Maximum word rates to Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are: full rate, 1 shilling 25 cents; CDE, 85 cents (five words minimum); deferred, 65 cents (five words minimum); letter telegrams, 42 cents (25 words minimum). Empire social telegrams 42 cents (13 words minimum).

Telephone exchanges or call offices are established at: Athi River, Elburgon, Eldama Ravine, Eldoret, Elgon (Central), Endebess, Gazi, Gilgil, Hoey's Bridge, Isiolo, Kabete, Kakamega, Kericho, Kiambu, Kijabe, Kikuyu, Kilifi, Kiminini, Kisii, Kisumu, Kitale, Koru, Kwale, Lamu, Limuru, Litein, Londiani, Lumbwa, Machakos, Maji Mazuri, Makuyu, Malindi, Mau Summit, Meru, Mitubiri, Moiben, Molo, Mombasa, Muhoroni, Nairobi, Naivasha, Nakuru, Nanyuki, Narok, Ngong, Njoro, Nyeri, Nyeri Station, Rongai, Ruiru, Sabatia, Songhor, Sotik, Soy, Subukia, Thika, Timau, Thomson's Falls, Turbo, Kipkarren, Turi, Ukunda. Trunk lines also connect the main exchanges of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. In addition a radio telephone service exists between Great Britain and the main telephone exchanges in Kenya.

Seven thousand two hundred and ninety-four telephones were in use in Kenya at the end of 1944.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Schools for Europeans, Indians, Goans, Arabs and Africans exist in all the principal centres in the colony.

Education is compulsory for European and Indian children between the ages of 7 and 15 years, with the exception that in the case of the latter this only applies to the larger centres.

There are two Government European secondary schools in Nairobi, one for boys and one for girls. These cater for both day scholars and boarders.

Eight Government European primary schools exist, of which four have boarding sections for both boys and girls and one for boys only.

There are also a number of private preparatory and other schools attended by Indians; there are also Government schools in the towns and larger townships.
and secondary education is provided. There are also 58 private schools of which 46 are assisted by grants-in-aid.

In Mombasa there is a combined Government primary and secondary school for Arab boys and also a Government girls school.

The academic education of Africans is organised in three stages: elementary, primary and secondary. Elementary schools are mostly administered by missions, some being aided by local native councils.

Government maintains 12 African primary schools and gives financial aid to 33 mission schools.

There are four mission secondary schools for Africans maintained financially by Government. After the full secondary school course a system of Government bursaries enables suitable students to go to Makerere College in Uganda for further academic education and professional training.

Education fees are as follows:

(a) Schools for European Children

Tuition Per Term.

Pupils in classes up to and including Sh. 30 sixth standard.

Pupils in classes above the sixth standard Sh.100

Hospital and Health Services

The health services of the colony and protectorate are maintained by various agencies. The Government Medical Department operates the great majority of hospitals providing facilities for all races, with the exceptions mentioned later.

The Medical Department is responsible for the control and maintenance of all native hospitals whether in townships or native reserves. In the reserves contributions are made by the local native councils towards the capital and recurrent costs of maternity wards and of dispensaries; and a similar principle is adopted in townships under the control of local authorities of contributions from local native trust funds.

There are Government European hospitals at Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. Including the accommodation at Mathari Mental Hospital, Nairobi, 100 European beds are provided. European hospitals are also maintained under local insurance schemes at Nakuru, Eldoret and Kitale. However, Government has now introduced a compulsory contributory scheme for the purpose of reducing costs for hospital maintenance, within which hospitals provided by local initiative may elect to operate in future.

There are three European private nursing homes in Nairobi in addition.

At native hospitals throughout the reserves and settled areas, 3,900 beds, including general and maternity beds, are now provided.

Non-personal health services, including port health services, are the sole concern of Government, except in the larger towns, where they are administered by local authorities. But in the reserves, local native councils again show great interest in these services and provide much material assistance.

Government maintains the Medical Research Laboratory in Nairobi, where research work and routine work is carried out and vaccines are manufactured.

Labour Services

The Labour Department was reorganised and expanded at the beginning of 1946 and is responsible for the inspection of the conditions of labour and the administration of the labour laws of the colony. Labour officers are posted in most of the important labour centres and, in addition to their inspectorate duties, intervene when required in cases of labour difficulties or disputes. The laws of the colony in consonance with international conventions provide for certain minimum conditions under which workers may be employed.

At 30th November, 1945, 254,757 men were employed on monthly contract and in addition 48,000 were employed in the military. In addition, some 40,000 families were residing on farms under contract, the adult males of which work for the farm occupiers for a limited period in each year. Some 15,000 men, women and juveniles were also employed on short term contracts.

Further information with regard to labour services can be obtained from the annual reports of the Labour Department and the Handbook of the Labour Laws, price Shs. 2, both obtainable from the Government Printer.

Climate

With the exception of the coast and the immediate interior, where the average temperature is about 80° F., the climate of Kenya is cool and invigorating. At Nairobi the mean temperature is 67° F., the mean maximum being 77° F., and the mean minimum 57° F.

There are generally two rainy seasons: the "Long Rains" of April to June, when the greater part of the rain falls, and the "Short Rains" of October to December; but in the high area west of the Rift Valley and north of the railway the wettest months are April to August. No month is invariably dry and near Lake Victoria showers occur on most afternoons. The mean annual rainfall on the coast is 40 inches, of which 20 inches may fall in April and May. Inland the rainfall decreases to 10 inches and then increases with altitude to an average of 40 inches over the highlands. On higher ground and near the lake average annual totals reach 70 inches.

Post-War Reorganisation

In order to meet efficiently and expeditiously the complexity of post-war conditions and problems of development and reconstruction, plans for the reorganisation of the Government were set on foot early in 1945. Decentralisation of the work hitherto canalised along traditional lines to the Chief Secretary began by the institution of a system of organising departments in groups under members of the Executive Council.

Under this system the Chief Secretary becomes "Chief Secretary and Member for Development and Reconstruction." By Government Notice No. 674 of 1st August, 1945, an Authority for Development and Reconstruction was established, with the Chief Secretary as Chairman and Sir Reginald Edwin Robins, general manager
of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and Sir Alfred Vincent, M.L.C., as members. The main powers and duties of the authority are to organise and superintend the execution of works and projects of reconstruction and development in accordance with approved plans communicated to it, and for that purpose to give directions to all departments or groups of departments of the Government. The establishment of the authority is reflected in the division of the 1946 estimates into two parts, the first part consisting of the ordinary budget of revenue and expenditure of the colony and protectorate, the second part comprising a Development and Reconstruction Fund, expenditure from which is controlled by the authority within the framework of the estimates of the authority as approved by the Legislative Council.

As part of this devolution of authority a Member for Health and Local Government has been appointed to take charge of the medical and local government departments and to represent these departments on the Executive and Legislative Councils. It is intended to establish a Local Government Board to supervise and control the activities of all local authorities, including local native councils which hitherto have not been the concern of the Local Government Department. Local native councils will be reconstituted as African district councils with powers and procedure similar to those of municipal authorities and district councils in the settled areas. The Local Government Board will work through standing committees for local government in urban, rural and purely African areas and relieve the Governor-in-Council of certain duties.

In health matters the member will be the channel of communication between the Medical Department and the Government, and will exercise a general supervision over the work of the department. He will also be the Chairman of the Hospital Authority which is being set up to govern European hospitalisation. Municipal authorities are already public health authorities; and other local authorities will increasingly assume public health responsibilities.

A third change has been to designate the Attorney-General as the Member for Law and Order, and he is responsible for all that that title implies. The fourth appointment has been that of a Member for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Natural Resources, who co-ordinates and lays down a general policy for the departments concerned with agriculture, veterinary services, forestry, game, soil and water conservation, research, and settlement, the latter including the settlement and re-settlement of Africans in the native lands, schemes for further European settlement, and investigations into the possibilities of Indian and Arab settlement. The Financial Secretary is now the Member for Finance.

Much of the administrative work hitherto performed by the Chief Secretary has been transferred to the Deputy Chief Secretary, who has been given a seat on the Executive Council as well as on the Legislative Council. The latter's work in turn now falls on the Administrative Secretary. To the Secretariat staff has been added an Economic and Commercial Advisor, whose services will be available to the development and reconstruction authority as well as to the Government.

There has been formed the Lands, Mines, and Surveys Department, which combines the functions of the lands, survey, and registration divisions with those of the former Mining and Geological Department.
