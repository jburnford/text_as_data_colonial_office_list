ADEN COLONY

SITUATION AND AREA

The Colony of Aden is situated in latitude 12° 47' N. and longitude 45° 10' E. about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia.

The island of Perim in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb and the Kuria Muria Islands, five in number, off the Dhufar coast of Oman, also form part of the colony.

CLIMATE

The climate of Aden Colony is not unhealthy though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. During the south-west monsoon, i.e., in July and August, strong winds prevail which give some relief from the damp airless heat of May, June and September. Sandstorms are apt to occur in the months of May, June, July and August. These come from a northerly direction usually a short time before sunset and are often very intense, though of short duration. The weather during July and August is frequently very hazy, and it is not uncommon for ships to pass quite close to Aden without picking up the land. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent; but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Colony of Aden (the total area of which exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas joined by a flat sandy foreshore. Aden proper (area 21 square miles) is on the south and Little Aden (area 15 square miles) on the west. The flat strip of coast joining the peninsulas is about 39 square miles in extent. The peninsulas form the horns of Aden Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. On the west side of the Aden Peninsula is Steamer Point the principal military and port area.

The Aden Peninsula is arid, rocky and of volcanic formation and Jabal Shamsan, its summit, is 1,725 feet (525 m.) high. Crater, the main Arab town, is situated five miles from the main port and lies in the crater of the extinct volcano forming the peninsula.

The isthmus is a flat sandy plain, barely three-quarters of a mile wide at its narrowest point near the peninsula, joining the latter with the mainland and containing the colony's principal aerodrome.

Some cultivation occurs at Sheikh Othman, at the base of the isthmus, in a garden under the management of the Township Authority, but except during the cold weather months produce is very limited. There are also privately-owned date gardens there. Hiswa, on the shore of Aden Bay, has groves of toddy palms. Salt is manufactured in large quantities on the flat shores of the bay, by the process of open evaporation.

Perim Island, situated in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, is bare, rocky and flat; its highest point, about a mile northward of its southern extremity, is 214 feet (65 m.) high. The surface of the island is grooved with dry water courses and covered with coarse grass and stunted shrubs, the subsoil being sand and conglomerate coral. It possesses a good small harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth, and an emergency landing ground on the north side.

HISTORY

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. The Aden Peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the island in the same year. It was later reoccupied by the British in January, 1857, and placed under the control of an Assistant to the Political Resident at Aden. In 1929, the manager of the Perim Coal Company was appointed Government Agent, but on the closing down of that company in October, 1936, the Commissioner of Police, Aden, was appointed Administrator of the island. A police detachment is maintained at Perim, and the Administrator makes regular visits from Aden, usually by air.

CONSTITUTION

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, the administrative control of the Aden Settlement was transferred from the Government of India to that of the Colonial Office with effect from 1st April, 1937, from which date Aden assumed the status of a crown colony.

POPULATION

The total population at the time of the census taken in 1931 was as follows:

| Location                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Crater                    | 21,383     |
| Maala, including Barrier Gate | 3,605      |
| Tawahi and Steamer Point, including Hedjuff | 7,502      |
| Sheikh Othman, Imad, Hiswa and Little Aden | 12,167     |
| Military Area (Steamer Point, including Khormaksar) | 1,981      |

Total: 46,638

The population of Perim was 623 of which 194 were Government employees.

A new census is being taken during 1946.

ADMINISTRATION

The colony is administered by a Governor, who is also Commander-in-Chief, aided by an Executive Council which at present comprises five members. The Council consists of the person holding the office of Chief Secretary and such other persons as the Governor in pursuance of instructions from His Majesty through the Secretary of State may from time to time appoint. Provision has been made for the establishment of a Legislative Council for the Colony of Aden.

In judicial cases the right of appeal to the High Court of Bombay has been preserved.

The Governor of the Colony is also Governor of the Aden Protectorate, the particulars of which are given separately.

Aden is a free port and there is no customs tariff. Excise duty is, however, levied on a specific duty basis on spirits, wines and beer, perfumed spirits, intoxicating and dangerous drugs, tobacco
and motor spirit. The management of the port is under the control of the Board of Trustees formed in 1888.

Under the Townships Ordinance, 1945, Township Authorities for the towns of Aden and Sheikh Othman were constituted, and the various municipal operations formerly carried out by the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement now devolve on the Township Authorities. There is a separate Town Council appointed by the Governor for each of these places.

The port facilities comprise an inner harbour offering good anchorage to a large number of vessels and also an outer harbour.

The harbour provides accommodation for twelve first-class berths, four second-class berths and ten third-class berths suitable for large, medium and small vessels respectively. There are seven oil berths and oil can normally be pumped to six of these berths simultaneously. Three more oil berths are expected to be installed on the northern limits of the mooring basin in the near future. Two powerful tugs controlled by the Port Trust are available for berthing and unberthing vessels, and for special services such as fire-fighting. In addition, there are fifteen small privately-owned tugboats suitable for towing lighters, which number 153. There are separate jetties for the landing and shipping of petroleum and munitions and private and public wharves which are suitable for lighters. Shed accommodation is available on some of the wharves, and the Port Trust has sheds on the Maala wharf covering an area of 16,300 square yards.

Moderate repairs to hull and machinery can be carried out by local firms. A number of slipways, suitable for vessels of light draught, are available and the Port Trust employ three divers.

In normal times of peace vessels of many principal steamship companies called regularly at Aden, connecting with all parts of the world.

Aden is an entrepot for trade with Arabia and other adjacent territories. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc.

RELIGION

The majority of the population is Moslem but there are communities of Jews, Hindus and Zoroastrians. There are two Anglican churches and two Roman Catholic churches, one of each situated in Steamer Point and Crater, and one Presbyterian and Methodist church in Steamer Point.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

Banking

The National Bank of India, Ltd., is established in the colony with its chief office in the Crater and a branch at Steamer Point. The Exchange Bank of India and Africa, Ltd., has a branch in Crater. The commercial firm of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw & Bros. also carries on the business of banking.

Currency

The monetary unit is the Indian rupee (silver) and is legal tender for any amount.

COMMUNICATIONS

Mails

Surface mails between Aden and all parts of the world are exchanged as opportunity offers by fairly frequent, but for the time being irregular, steamship services using the port. Air mails to and from all parts of the world are exchanged several times weekly by the service operated by the B.O.A.C. between Aden and Cairo, which calls at Kamaran, Asmara and Port Sudan. At Cairo this service connects with the main trunk services of the B.O.A.C. operating between London and South Africa, and between London and India, Malaya and the East, and Australia. Additional air mails are exchanged by B.O.A.C. services once weekly with Mukalla and Karachi, and twice weekly with Hargeisa (Somaliland) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).

Telephones

An automatic telephone system serves the whole colony. There are about 850 telephones including those in Government and military offices, either connected directly to the main exchange or through private branch exchanges.

External Telecommunications

Cable & Wireless (M.E.), Ltd., are responsible for all external civil communications. They own and operate a cable station from which their submarine cables connect with countries all over the world. They also operate wireless telegraph services from Aden to Mukalla in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and between Aden and Addis Ababa in Abyssinia, Djibouti in French Somaliland, Hargeisa in British Somaliland and Kamaran in the Red Sea.

A cable from Aden connects with Perim whence another cable belonging to the Yemen extends to Sheikh Said, thus linking Perim and the Yemen with all parts of the world through the company’s system.

There is no internal telegraph system and there are no railways.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Medical Services

There is a Government civil hospital (177 beds) in Crater, a tuberculosis hospital (16 beds) at Sheikh Othman and a maternity child welfare clinic (13 beds). There is a hospital of the Keith Falconer Mission at Sheikh Othman (60 beds).

There are two dispensaries organised by charity catering especially for sick poor, and a small Government dispensary at Perim Island.

Public health work is supervised by a Medical Officer of Health under the control of the Director of Medical Services. The infectious diseases hospital is also under his care.

The Port Health Officer is responsible for the out-patient treatment of members of the merchant navies on vessels in port. He is also in charge of routine quarantine administration and the maintenance of Flint Island quarantine station.

Educational Facilities

Education in Aden Colony is under the control of a Director, who also gives advice as required to the British Agents appointed to the Eastern and Western Protectorates.

In the colony Government maintains four boys’ and two girls’ primary schools and one boys’ secondary school. There are in addition five aided primary and four aided secondary schools or sections of schools for boys and four aided primary and two aided secondary schools for girls, as well as several unrecognised schools. In all schools in the colony there are approximately 4,000 pupils in primary or indigenous schools classes (including 1,050 girls) and 790 pupils in secondary classes (including 110 girls).
There is an Educational Advisory Committee representing the principal communities in the colony.

The British Council opened an institute for men in 1940, and an institute for women in 1942.

Labour.

There are no organised labour services in the colony. The inhabitants of Aden are principally engaged in trading, shop-keeping and domestic employment. The large number of coolies employed by the salt works, shipping concerns and contractors are drawn from the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen. The small harbour craft are mostly manned by Somalis.

**Aden Protectorate**

**Situation and Area**

The Aden Protectorate, which can be more conveniently described administratively and geographically by dividing it into two areas, the Western and Eastern, has a total superficial area of about 112,000 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the western boundary of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen (whose southern boundary was temporarily stabilised by Article III of the Treaty of Sana’a of 11th February, 1934, by which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of the Yemen agreed to maintain the status quo as on the date of the signature of the treaty), and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. The Aden Protectorate seaboard starts at Husn Murad (opposite Perim) on the west and runs for 740 miles eastwards to Ras Dhurbat Ali where it meets the frontier of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.

**Climate**

The maritime plains are damp and hot in the summer and are subject to sand storms and high winds. In the winter (October to the end of March) it is cool and sometimes cold at night and much less damp.

In the mountains, which vary in height between 1,500 and 8,000 feet, it is drier and cooler during the day and night above 2,500 feet; and above 4,500 feet it can be very cold.

In the Wadi Hadhramaut and the intervening tableland or “Jol” extremes of both heat and cold are encountered. The heat in contrast to that of the coast is dry but more intense. The rainfall is small.

There is little rainfall in the littoral and maritime hills: here cultivation is chiefly dependent on irrigation from water channels and courses. In the highlands well irrigation is common and there is heavier rainfall which is led down ravines and defiles into terraced fields.

**General Description**

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into:

(a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth;
(b) the maritime ranges about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level;
(c) the intramontane plains over 3,000 feet high; and
(d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Ruba’ Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys. Some of the valleys are very fertile. The plateau itself is broken up by numerous hills and mountains and is intersected with several deep valleys.

The greater part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate consists of desert and barren mountains intersected by Wadis, some of which are fertile and cultivated. There are a number of comparatively large towns notably Mukalla, the capital of the Qu’aiti State and principal seaport, and Seiyun the capital of the Kathiri State.

The Western Aden Protectorate consists of the following tribal districts, the chiefs of which are in protective treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government:

Abdali, His Highness Sultan Sir Abdul Karim Fadhli, K.C.M.G., K.C.I.E., Sultan of Lahej, who is the premier chief of the western area.

Amiri, Amir Nasr bin Shaif Seif, C.M.G. Capital, Dhala.

Fadhli, Sultan Abdullah bin Uthman. Capital, Shuqra.

Lower Yafa’i, Sultan ’Aidrus bin Muhsin. Capital, Al Qara.

Haushabi, Sultan Muhammad bin Sarur. Capital, Muselmir.

Upper Yafa’i Confederation, Sultan Muhammad bin Salih. Capital, Mahajba. Mauhatta, Sheikh Ahmed Bubakr ’Ali ’Askar and Sheikh Husein Salih Muhsin ’Askar. Capital, Al Qudma. Dubhi, Sheikhhayat vacant. Capital, Dhi Sura. Maflahi, Sheikh Qasim ’Abdurrahman. Capital, Al Jurba. Hadhrami, Sheikh Muhammad Muhsin Ghalib. Capital, Ash Shibr.

Shaib, Sheikh Muhammad Muqbil As Saqladi. Capital, Bakhal.

Quteibi, Sheikh Hasan ’Ali. Capital, Ath Thumeir.

Alawi, Sheikh Salih Sayil. Capital, Al Qash’a.

Aqrabi, Sheikh Muhammad Fadhli Ba ’Abdullah. Capital, Bir Ahmed.

Audhali, Sultan Salih bin Husein. Capital, Lodar.

Upper ’Aulaqi, Sultan ’Awadh bin Salih bin Abdullah. Capital, Nisab. Sheikh Muhsin bin Farid. Capital, Yeshbum.

Lower ’Aulaqi, Sultan ’Aidrus bin Abdullah. Capital, Ahwar.

Beihan, Sharif Salih bin Husein. Capital, An Nuqub.

Subeihi, Sheikhs Muhammad ’Ali Ba Salih, Sheikh Muhammad bin ’Ali, of the Barhimi and Abdullah ba Sa’id of the ’Atifi.
The Eastern Aden Protectorate comprises the Hadhramaut (consisting of the Qu’aiti State of Shihir and Mukalla and the Kathiri State of Seiyun), the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra, the Wahidi Sultanates of Bir ‘Ali, and the Sheikdoms of Irqa and Haura, all of which have been for many years in protective treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. His Highness Sultan Sir Salih bin Ghalib al Qu’aiti, K.C.M.G., Sultan of Shihir and Mukalla, is the premier chief in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and the Hadhramaut is the most important and best organised of these areas. It is bounded on the west by the Wahidi Sultanates and on the east by the Mahri Sultanate.

The Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra is the most easterly area in the Aden Protectorate, being bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. The Sultan of Qishn and Socotra resides on the island of Socotra, which lies off Africa, 150 miles from Cape Guardafui. The island was occupied by the East India Company in 1834, and it came under British protection, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kuri and Brothers Islands, in 1866, when the treaty with the Mahri Sultan was concluded. Socotra produces aloes, dragons’ blood and ghee. The population is probably about 5,000; the island is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous and the Fidadam Hajr rises to nearly 5,000 feet. The capital is Hadibu, known on European maps as Tamrida.

**HISTORY**

For a time in the 18th century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a (capital of the Yemen of today) and several of the rulers of the tribal districts such as the ’Abdali, Haushabi, Amiri, Yafa’i and ’Aulaqi sultans, were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence. This occurred in 1728 in the case of the ’Abdali and in 1758 in the case of the Yafa’i.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the ’Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July, 1915, during the first world war, the Turks, who then held the Yemen, occupied the ’Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts until the armistice of 1918.

In February, 1934, as has been stated, a Treaty of Friendship was signed between His Majesty’s Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower ’Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa’i sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala’) entered into closer relations with His Majesty’s Government by new treaties in which they agreed, *inter alia*, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri sultans and the rise of the Qu’aiti—a dynasty with its origins among the Yafa’i tribes and influence arising from military and other services rendered as emigres to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu’aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with His Majesty’s Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with the other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri sultans made an agreement with the Qu’aiti sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu’aiti and Kathiri sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British Resident Adviser in all matters except those concerning Muhammadan religion and custom. Relations with the smaller states are governed by similar Proctorate treaties.

**POPULATION**

The population of the Aden Protectorate is roughly estimated at 630,000.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The interests of the Western Aden Protectorate are looked after by a small cadre of British political officers and Arab assistant political officers under a British Agent, whose headquarters are in Aden. The political staff who are posted to administrative districts inland advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas, since His Majesty’s Government does not administer the Protectorate directly.

The tribes nominate their own chiefs who have subsequently to be recognised by the Governor of Aden. Not all the chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery. For internal security some of the chiefs have tribal guards (paid for by His Majesty’s Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the British Agent and the chief. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate; they are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Government.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal states, Qu’aiti and Kathiri, are administered by their sultans as constitutional rulers. The Qu’aiti sultan has a state council. The Kathiri State is advancing slowly on the same lines, being hampered by the absence of an outlet to the sea and of the customs dues and other benefits which would result from it. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the British Agent’s supervision.

**RELIGION**

The people are Muslim Arabs of, almost entirely, the Shafa’i persuasion.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

In the Western Aden Protectorate rupees and riyals (or Maria Theresa dollars) are the currency used, the present (1946) rate of exchange being 2½ rupees to the riyal.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, up to 1944, the Maria Theresa dollar was the currency used throughout the interior but in that year the rupee currency was officially adopted. Maria Theresa dollars, however, remain the normal form of currency in the Wahidi country and vicinity.

There are no banking facilities in the Aden Protectorate.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic. The chief of these in the Western Aden Protectorate are:

1. Aden (north and north-westwards) through Lahej to Ta’iz (Yemen) and to Dhala and Qataba (Yemen).
2. Aden westwards to Subaihi country.
3. Aden eastwards to—
   (a) Lower Yafa'.
   (b) Ahwar (Lower 'Aulaqi).
   (c) Fadhli country.
   (d) 'Audhali country.
   (e) Dathina.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate considerable progress has been made in recent years in road development, and routes run north of Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut, west to the provinces of Melfa'a-Hajz and Bir Ali, and east as far as Reidat Al Abdul Wadud.

Airfields are maintained by the Royal Air Force for communications of a political nature and for security work. The B.O.A.C. has a regular service calling twice weekly at Riyam on the Cairo-Aden-Karachi route. In normal times coastal steamers from Aden and a certain number of larger vessels on the India and the Far East routes call at Mukalla. Both Qu'aiti and Kathiri States belong to the Aden Postal Union and have their own issues of stamps. Cable & Wireless, Ltd., maintain a wireless link between Mukalla, Seiyun and Aden and there is a network of political wireless stations in the hinterland.

SOCIAL SERVICES

In the Western Aden Protectorate the development of schools is fostered by the political staff in close consultation with the Colony Education Department.

The only school directly administered by the Aden Education Department is the Aden Protectorate College for the Sons of Chiefs, a primary boarding school of limited size, in Aden.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, in some departments notably in education and customs administration, there has been much progress. An Educational Assistant to the Resident Adviser, seconded from the Sudan, assists the Mukalla Government in educational matters. There are now over 20 primary schools and an intermediate boarding school for about 100 pupils. Several scholarships have been awarded to promising students to complete their education in the Sudan.

A Protectorate Education Officer was appointed in November, 1944.

The Government of Aden, in co-operation with the Church of Scotland Mission, has introduced a medical scheme in the Western Aden Protectorate which covers 12 tribal areas and employs 23 dispensers who work in 16 separate dispensaries.

TRADE, INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE

Trade in the Western Aden Protectorate is chiefly confined to transit trade from the Yemen, from which coffee and skins are exported, but no reliable figures are available. The only industries are weaving, dyeing and charcoal-burning though some silver work is made by the few small village Jewish communities. Some 10,000 camels bring vegetables, eggs, fodder and cattle for sale in Aden every month.

Imports into the Western Aden Protectorate include kerosene, soap, ginger, tobacco, rice, flour, tea, sugar and assorted cloths, etc.

Agriculture is the chief occupation of the majority of the tribesmen of the Western Aden Protectorate. Every possible use is made of irrigation and water rights are a frequent cause of tribal feuds.

The staple crops are corn (dhurra), bulrush millet (dukhn) and some Indian corn. Wheat and barley are found at the higher altitude; other crops are sesame and lucerne: some cotton and local indigo (hawir) is also grown. Dates are grown in some areas and coffee in Yafa'. Bananas, papayas, apricots and peaches are found in the 'Abdali and 'Audhali sultanates. Honey is found in small quantities in two or three areas.

PUBLIC REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE

As local administrations have but recently been set up it is not yet possible to estimate the revenues of the states in the Western Aden Protectorate.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the revenue of the Qu'aiti Government may be roughly estimated at 16 lakhs and expenditure at 13 lakhs of rupees. The principal sources of revenue are customs and excise and licence dues but the introductions of land and date palm taxation will provide another fruitful source. The finances of the other sultanates have not yet been stabilised. Two lakhs are spent on police and armed constabulary, two lakhs on education, 3½ lakhs on the army and 3½ lakhs on public works.
