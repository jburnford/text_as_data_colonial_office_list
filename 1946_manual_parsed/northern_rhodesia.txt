NORTHERN RHODESIA

Situation and Area

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the territory is estimated at about 284,745 square miles.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into six provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Lusaka, to which the principal departmental headquarters were moved from Livingstone in May, 1935. Other important settlements are at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Mazabuka, Ndola, near which the copper mines of Nchanga, Nkana, Roan Antelope and Mufulira are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu in Barotseland.

History and Constitution

The first explorations north of the Zambesi were carried out by various Portuguese travellers at the end of the eighteenth century. The first British person to enter Northern Rhodesia was Dr. Livingstone who reached the Zambesi in 1855. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, 20 years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the north but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to the east coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898.
On 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company conferring upon it large powers of administration in Rhodesia to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa. In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders-in-Council dated 20th February, 1924, the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Financial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Provincial Commissioner, and the Director of Medical Services. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and seven unofficial elected members, and one unofficial member nominated to represent native interests. On 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, G.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

**ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL**

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as native authorities and courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District Officers. The Barotse Province is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a khota or native council to assist him.

The law of the territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the territory unless it has been specifically applied.

Administrative officers in their capacities as magistrates of subordinate courts have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from subordinate courts of the 3rd class to provincial commissioners' courts and from subordinate courts (including provincial commissioners' courts) of the 1st and 2nd class to the High Court.

### EDUCATION

#### European

For the education of European children there were, in February, 1946, controlled schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka (one for boys and one for girls), Broken Hill, Ndola, Luanshya, Kitwe, Mufulira and Chingola, offering primary education up to Standard 5 and secondary education up to Form II, including Latin, French, Afrikaans, algebra, geometry, science, woodwork and household management in Forms I and II. There were controlled schools at Fort Jameson and Silver Rest offering primary education up to Standard 5. All these schools were under Government management. The Convent School, Broken Hill, offering education up to the Cambridge School Certificate examination, the Convent schools, Ndola and Luanshya, offering primary education up to Standard 5 and secondary education up to Form II, and Sakeji school, Sawmills school, and the Convent schools Livingstone and Lusaka, offering primary education up to Standard 5, were controlled but under private management. A private nursery school for children under school age was registered at Luanshya and another at Mufulira.
Boarding accommodation was available for girls at Choma, for boys at Mazabuka and for boys and girls at Lusaka, all under Government management. The Convent schools at Broken Hill and Ndola, and Sakeji school also provided boarding accommodation.

**Coloured and Asiastic**

There was a school for coloured children in the Fort Jameson district, offering education up to Standard 5, under Government management. There was a private Government-aided Indian school at Lusaka and another at Livingstone, both offering education up to Standard 5.

**African**

The Department of African Education supervises the educational work of the mission societies which, assisted through a grant-in-aid system, are responsible for the management of the majority of schools in the territory. There is an advisory board on African Education with Mission, African and Government representatives.

In 1945 there were 1,084 schools receiving grant-in-aid, including 25 native authority schools. Tuition is free, fees are paid at boarding schools. Primary education is divided into three grades: Elementary (Sub-Std. A to Std. II); Lower Middle (Stds. III and IV); Upper Middle (Stds. V and VI). The teaching of English normally begins in Sub-Std. B. Teachers for the elementary and lower middle schools are trained at two Government and 19 mission centres of which five are specifically for girls. The total enrolment in all types of assisted and Government schools is 117,000, of whom 36,000 are girls. Compulsory education for the age group, 12–16 years, has been introduced into three districts on the Copperbelt and at Broken Hill and Livingstone. As staff and buildings become available it will be introduced at other urban centres.

There are 28 Government schools. The Jeanes School, Chalimbana, trains school supervisors and teachers for the primary schools and also provides an annual course for Chiefs. The Munali Training Centre, Lusaka, includes a trade school and a secondary school with classes going up to the Cambridge School Certificate standard. Africans who desire higher education go either to Makerere College, Uganda, or to the South African College, Fort Hare. Government gives bursaries to those who qualify and are selected for higher education.

The estimated expenditure on African education for 1946 is £190,253, of which £106,150 is grants-in-aid for recurrent expenditure and £18,941 for capital expenditure.

**Climate**

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from May to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° F. to 90° F. with a maximum of 103° F. and a minimum of 56° F. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 55° F. to 75° F. with a maximum of 86° F. and a minimum of 40° F. In some parts the maximum temperature has reached the high figure of 120° F., whilst a minimum of 30° F. or less is not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from over 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 inches or less in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again.

**AGRICULTURE.**

The livestock population of the territory remains constant and no major outbreaks of disease or climatic disasters have occurred to cause heavy mortality during recent years. Stock ranching is confined to areas free from trypanosomiasis. Contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia in Barotse-land is no longer regarded as endemic. An abattoir built by Government in Livingstone to assist the eradication of this disease commenced operations early in 1944 and helped to relieve the meat shortage within the territory.

Consumption of livestock and livestock products outpaces local production and in these circumstances livestock producers have been able to dispose of all produce to advantage. Subsidy payments on approved breeding stock and on increased butterfat production have been arranged as an interim measure to stimulate production by European livestock farmers.

Free inoculation against the more common endemic diseases—principally quarter-evil and anthrax, dipping of cattle and instruction of cattle owners in better animal husbandry methods are proceeding in the native reserves, but progress is slow.

The greater portion of the territory is undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little general trade in food commodities except in the railway belt where the surplus native maize crop is marketed by the Maize Control Board. The staple native cereals are finger millet (*Eleusine coracana*), Kaffir-corn (*Sorghum*), and maize. The former is produced over extensive tracts of the territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby grain crops are grown in rotation with forest re-growths. Other native crops are bulrush millet (*Pennisetum typhloideum*), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes and a variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption and a small localised trade only. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the territory, but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Marosi, Baila, Matoka, and, to a less extent, the Angoni in north-eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the territory are impassable to animal transport owing to the presence of tsetse fly.

In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

Maize is the chief crop of the settler. In the season 1944/45 some 45,000 acres were planted and the total crop was 330,000 bags of which about 60,000 bags were retained for farm consumption and the remainder sold for internal consumption. Wheat is grown under irrigation and is at present exported to Bulawayo for milling. Some 23,000 bags were grown in 1945.

Flue-cured Virginia tobacco is produced chiefly in the Eastern Province. Production has
averaged about 2½ million pounds in recent years, a quarter of a million pounds of which have been produced in the railway belt. 400,000 pounds of Northern Rhodesia leaf are admitted annually, duty free, to the Union of South Africa. Southern Rhodesia takes approximately a further 450,000 pounds. The balance of the Virginia tobacco is exported overseas.

Turkish tobacco production is a recent development. It is grown mainly in the railway belt and production now exceeds half a million pounds per annum.

The headquarters of the Agricultural Department and the Veterinary Department are at Mazabuka.

FORESTRY

More than 60 per cent. of the entire area of Northern Rhodesia is estimated to be more or less covered with trees and shrubs, but the forest growth, chiefly of the Savannah woodland type, is undergoing considerable modification in composition and area as a result of native shifting cultivation and annual fires. A Forestry Branch of the Agricultural Department was instituted in 1929. Certain areas are being maintained as protection forests for the prevention of soil erosion and the preservation of water supplies in springs and rivers. Further areas are dedicated to the production of timber of the more useful indigenous species. Small experimental plantations of fast-growing exotic tree species have been established.

The only large commercial timber industry in the territory at present is that of the Zambesi Saw Mills, Ltd., whose operations extend from Livingstone to the Machili River under concessions granted by the Government. This company is chiefly concerned with the extraction, by light railway, of timbers of the Kalahari sand belt type, including Mkushi, Baikiaea plurijuga; Mukwa, Pterocarpus angolensis; Mwangura, Pterocarpus stenovsonii; Mupumena, Entandrophragma sp.; Mkamba, Afzelia quanzensis; Mugongo, Ricinodendron rautanenii; and Mushevese, Burkea africana. The company has contracts for supplying Mkushi sleepers to the South African and Rhodesian railways.

LAND SETTLEMENT

An Agricultural Survey Commission reported in 1932 upon the unalienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European settlement, and this Commission has advised as to the class of farming or ranching for which the land is suitable. The Government is not embarking on any extensive programme of land settlement. Crown land and privately owned land, however, suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 2s and 15s. per acre, depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on lease with option to purchase. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Application for land in Northern Rhodesia, should be addressed to the Commissioner for Lands Livingstone.

MINERALS

The Department of Lands, Mines and Surveys administers the Mining Law and the Registration of Mining Titles Ordinance subsidiary thereto, and the Mining and Explosives Regulations, the Winding Engine Drivers' (Certificate of Competency) Regulations and the Factories Ordinance and Factories (Safety) Regulations. The Registry of Mining Titles is kept, duty assessed, and the necessary searches are made.

The copper produced in the territory in 1945 totalled 194,014 tons, valued at £10,253,834, as against 220,827 tons valued at £10,295,839 in 1944. The production of the various copper mines in 1945 was:—Mufulira, 49,442 tons of blister copper; Nchanga, 17,377 tons of blister copper and 334 tons of copper concentrates which were sold as concentrates; Nkana, 13,997 tons of blister copper and 61,324 tons of electrolytic copper; Roan Antelope, 51,874 tons of blister copper. As a by-product Nkana also produced 33,430 cwts. of cobalt alloy. During 1945 the vertical shaft at Nchanga was equipped, a new headgear erected and the shaft brought into commission for hoisting ore which had previously been hoisted up the inclined shafts by means of endless rope haulages. Production, with a pilot plant, commenced in 1939 and the full-scale mill and concentrating plant were almost completed by the end of 1945.

Lead, zinc and vanadium are produced at Broken Hill where opencast mining has now been almost entirely superseded by underground methods. Considerable progress has been made in the erection of the new plant which will enable sulphide ore to be treated but, owing to the war and the difficulty in obtaining some of the machinery and materials, some sections of the plant are not yet completed. A new hydroelectric station, on the Lunsemfwa River, came into operation in November, 1945.

Some of the lead produced is fabricated at the mine into pipes and sheets for use in the metallurgical plant and the manganese ore is used as a re-agent in the production of zinc. The provisional value of the major products during 1945 is lead, £68,800; zinc, £563,880; and vanadium, £250,056.

Other mineral activities, with the exception of mica, are small. During the war the production of sheet mica, which was urgently required for war purposes, was stepped up and in 1944 reached the high record for the territory of 32,484 lbs., valued at £11,964. The 1945 output fell to 11,788 lbs., valued at £4,125.

The mineral production for the years 1944 and 1945 was:

| Mineral                  | 1944   | 1945   |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| Gold                     | ozs.   |        |

| Mica (waste)             | lbs.   |        |
| Silica rock              | tons   |        |

The minerals produced during 1944 were valued at £12,201,862 and those produced during 1945 are provisionally valued at £11,859,014.
COMMUNICATIONS

Railways

The railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have now been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nchanga via Nkana, a distance of 84 miles. Another line runs from Mokambo, in the Belgian Congo, to Mufulira, nine miles distant.

Roads

Road communications have been improved and further improvements are being undertaken. The arterial road system has been provided with a large number of permanent bridges and culverts and a programme to complete this work is in hand. The main arterial roads are:

(i) The Great North Road from the Otto Beit Bridge over the Zambesi River at Chirundu on the Southern Rhodesia border via Kafue, where the road joins the railway line, Lusaka, Broken Hill and Kapiri Mposhi, where the road leaves the railway line to Mpika, Isoka, and Tunduma where the road joins the Tanganyika and Nyasaland road systems. The length of the Great North Road is 750 miles. From Mpika there is a road to Abercorn and Mpulungu Harbour on Lake Tanganyika via Kasama, a distance of 270 miles and from Abercorn there is a connection to Tunduma, a distance of 114 miles.

(ii) The Livingstone Road from Livingstone follows the railway line northwards until it meets the Great North Road at Kafue River, a distance of 276 miles.

(iii) The Great East Road runs from Lusaka eastwards to Fort Jameson and the Nyasaland border, a distance of 400 miles. This road crosses the Luangwa River at 150 miles from Lusaka by an imposing bridge presented to the territory by the Beit Trust.

(iv) The Congo Border road which branches from the Great North Road 3 miles north of Kapiri Mposhi proceeds north to the Copper mining area and from there on to Solwezi and Mwinilunga, a distance of 498 miles. The Kafue River near Nkana is crossed by another large bridge presented by the Beit Trust. From Solwezi there is a road southwards to Kasempa and Mumbwa then running eastwards to join the Great North Road 45 miles north of Lusaka.

From Kasempa a road 229 miles in length runs westwards to Balovale.

A new road 122 miles in length from Mufulira across the pedicle of the Congo to Fort Rosebery and the Northern Province is expected to be opened this year.

In the copper mining area, Ndola-Luanshya and Nkana are connected by bituminous surfaced roads and it is expected that Nkana-Nchanga and Mufulira will be connected with similar surfaces within a short time. The road from Livingstone to the Victoria Falls has a bituminous surface also.

In addition to the above main roads there is a large mileage of secondary roads serving the settled areas and districts.

Rivers

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aviation

The main air routes are as follows:

Internal
(1) Lusaka to Livingstone, via Mazabuka.
(2) Lusaka to Fort Jameson.
(3) Lusaka to Mongu, via Namwala and Mankoya.
(4) Lusaka to Broken Hill, Ndola, Mpika, Kasama, and by request to Abercorn.
(5) Livingstone to Mongu, via Sesheke and Senanga.

External
(1) Salisbury – Lusaka – Ndola – Kasama – Tabora–Nairobi.

Lusaka airport is equipped with a hangar capable of accommodating most types of aircraft, the door span of the hangar being 125 feet. There is also a ground staff in residence.

Hangars are available for small aircraft (e.g., Tiger Moths) only at Livingstone, Ndola and Fort Jameson.

Posts, Telegraphs and Wireless

There is a daily mail service by rail between offices on the line of rail. Offices off the line of rail receive and despatch mails at least once a week. Mails for Fort Jameson, Mankoya, and Mongu-Lealui (Barotseland) are carried by air to and from Lusaka. Other cross posts are by motor vehicle or carriers. Mails to and from adjoining countries are despatched by all mail trains and letter mails are also forwarded by air services. Letter mails exchanged with Empire countries and air mails for other countries are forwarded by the B.O.A.C. twice a week, connection with the main service being made at Beira by feeder services. Seaborne mails are forwarded via Cape Town but there is also a parcels post service once a fortnight via Lobito Bay.

There are 44 post offices, 14 of which are money order offices and 26 are telegraph offices. The main telegraph and telephone route lies alongside the railway line from Victoria Falls to the Congo Border with branches from Ndola to Luanshya and Ndola to Chingola and Mufulira via Kitwe.

Wireless stations at Abercorn, Fort Jameson, Kasama, Mpika, Mongu-Lealui, Balovale, Kasempa and Mwinilunga, maintain a public service while stations at Kasama, Livingstone, Lusaka and Ndola are equipped for communication with aircraft in flight on 900 metres as well as for point to point working on short waves.

CUSTOMS DUTIES

The tariff, excluding the Congo Basin tariff, provides for Empire preference for the following classes of goods which are mainly liable to ad valorem rates of duty; clothing, blankets and rugs, cotton piece goods, motor cars, and all articles usually imported for household and native use, the duty on Empire products being in almost every instance 10 per cent. and the duty on foreign varying from 15 to 30 per cent.; in the case of cotton and silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, and rubber shoes, from foreign countries, the tariff provides for additional or alternative specific
rates if the duty should be greater at such rates. Agricultural, electrical, mining and other industrial machinery, pipes and piping, metals and metal manufactures imported for industrial purposes, if of Empire manufacture are free of duty and if foreign are subject to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., except foreign electrical machinery which is 10 per cent.

Specific rates of duty apply to practically all imported foodstuffs, lubricating oils, paraffin and cement, and to spirits, wines, beer and tobacco; upon the latter items, apart from rum, bitters, beer and cigars, no preference is granted except under the terms of the customs agreements with the neighbouring territories in the south, but varying rates of preference are granted, under the tariff, to foodstuffs of British origin.

### Taxation

An income tax was first imposed in Northern Rhodesia in 1921. The rates of tax now in force for individuals are:

(a) If unmarried throughout the year ended 31st March, 1946:

- Personal deduction of £240, reducing by £1 for every £1 by which the income exceeds £360.
- Deduction for insurance, the premium paid limited to one-sixth of the difference between the amount of income and the personal deduction, and further limited to £200.
- Deduction for dependent, the amount expended, not exceeding £100.

Rates of tax, applied to the chargeable income, that is, the income remaining after deducting the deductions above:

- For each £1 of the first £500, 2s. in the £.
- For each £1 of the next £500, 3s. in the £.
- For each £1 of the next £500, 4s. in the £.
- For each £1 in excess of £1,500, 5s. in the £.

(b) If married for any portion of the year ended 31st March, 1946, and wife living with, or wholly maintained by the taxpayer:
