THE LEEWARD ISLANDS

Situation and Area

The colony of the Leeward Islands, with a total area of 422 square miles, consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands group) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. The islands of Antigua, Barbuda, St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Montserrat form a fairly compact group between the 61st and 63rd degree of west longitude and around the 17th degree of north latitude; but Anguilla, Sombrero, and still more the Virgins group (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, etc.), lie apart to the north and north-west.

St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, whilst Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Politically the colony is divided into four Presidencies:—Antigua (with Barbuda), St. Christopher and Nevis (with Anguilla), Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. These have been united and separated at various times in their history, and were finally federated in 1871 by Imperial Act 34 and 35 Vict., cap. 107. Sombrero was added to the colony by Order-in-Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act on the 10th August, 1904, being attached to the Virgin Islands Presidency, and later transferred to St. Christopher and Nevis.

On 1st January, 1940, Dominica, which had been a presidency of the colony of the Leeward Islands, was separated and became a colony of the Windward Islands.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned that they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both of which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Presidencies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

Constitution

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871" one Executive Council and a legislative body styled "The General Legislative Council," under one Governor, were constituted for the five (now four) presidencies. The General Legislative Council consists of nine official members and nine unofficial members. Of the unofficial members three are elected from among the Island Council of Antigua, three from the Island Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, one of whom shall at the time of election be resident in Nevis, and two from the Island Council of Montserrat. These members must be and continue to be members of their respective island councils and are elected to the General Legislative Council for a period of three years. As there is no island council in the Virgin Islands, an unofficial member is appointed by the Governor, under Section 9 of the Leeward Islands Act, to represent that Presidency, but whenever such an appointment is made the Governor must under the provisions of the said section, appoint a person holding office under the Government of the Colony, and approved by the Secretary of State, to be an official member of the said Council. The official members are the Governor, the person for the time being performing the duties of Colonial...
Secretary, the holder of the substantive appointment of Administrator of Antigua, the holder of the substantive appointment of Administrator of St. Christopher and Nevis, the person for the time being lawfully performing the duties of Attorney General, the holder of the substantive appointment of Commissioner of Montserrat, the holder of the substantive appointment of Commissioner of the Virgin Islands, and the person for the time being lawfully performing the duties of Federal Treasurer.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, air, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education, and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order-in-Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the legislative body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different act. Constitutional changes involving the electoral principle with unofficial majorities in the Presidential Councils came into being in 1937.

**Currency and Banking**

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), Ltd., and the Royal Bank of Canada have branches in Antigua and St. Kitts, and the latter bank has a branch in Montserrat. In Nevis and the Virgin Islands there are no banks.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

EDUCATION

The system of elementary education is denominational in Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, the various denominations being Anglicans, Methodists and Roman Catholics. In the other presidencies elementary education is provided by the Government. On 31st December, 1944, there were 99 aided and Government schools in the colony. The clergy of the various denominations are granted facilities for giving religious instruction during school hours to the children of their respective churches. During the year 1944 the Government grants to all the elementary schools in the colony amounted to £52,000.

School fees have now been abolished in all public elementary schools throughout the colony. The schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. In the 99 aided and Government schools there were enrolled on 31st December, 1944, 28,000 children, with a daily average attendance of 23,000. For secondary education there are Government grammar schools for boys in St. Kitts, and for boys and girls in Montserrat, private grammar schools for boys in Antigua, private girls' high schools in Antigua and St. Kitts, and private mixed schools in Antigua, Nevis and St. Kitts (convent).

The standard of the secondary schools is the Cambridge School Certificate.

There is a training college for female teachers in Antigua (under the control of the Moravian Church).

A system of grading civil service clerks has been established throughout the colony. The pay assigned to the several grades is as follows:

- Junior clerks—£120-£10-£150-£15-£250.
- Senior clerks—£260-£20-£320.

ANTIGUA

Antigua is situated in W. longitude 61° 45', and N. latitude 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is officially recognised as 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 902) and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 624 square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 square miles, is very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces sea island cotton, charcoal, salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing and horse rearing. Cotton is being grown with favourable results. Deer were introduced by the Codringtons. The island has communication with Antigua by a sailing-boat service. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N. latitude, 61° 35' W. longitude, one mile by one-third mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered in 1865, formerly worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under licence and subject to an annual rental of £50.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called
Santa Maria de la Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, but there are a few springs and many wells, and the island has not latterly been subjected to the droughts from which it suffered in the past. The island is in the main low-lying and has no forests.

| 1943 | 55.93     |
| 1944 | 43.67     |
| 1945 | 55.99     |

On 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of 16 members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Governor presided. By Ordinance No. 20 of 1936 the Council was reconstituted and is now composed of the Administrator as President, two other officials, three nominated and five elected members.

The chief products are sugar and cotton. In 1945, 12,000 acres were under sugar-cane, 1,129 under cotton, 2,000 under provisions, and 53,851 were uncultivated.

St. John, the chief town, has a population of 6,997 (census of 1921), and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1945, 22 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 344.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS

This presidency consists of the islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla. These were united to form one presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population on 31st December, 1945, was estimated at 38,574, as compared with 38,214 at the census of 1921. The total area is about 152 square miles.

CONSTITUTION AND GOVERNMENT

In 1625 Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas) Warner landed in St. Christopher, bearing a Royal Commission to the Earl of Carlisle, by which the islands of St. Christopher (or Merwar’s Hope), Nevis, Barbados, and Montserrat, were taken under royal protection, and given over to his custody as the Knight Lieutenant.

In 1671 St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla—and all the other Leeward Islands—were separated from Barbados and created the “Leeward Caribbee Islands Government,” and Sir Charles Wheler was appointed “Captain-General” of the same. The chief seat of government was then at Nevis, but afterwards transferred to Antigua, and the government of each island, in the absence of the Captain-General, was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, or, when none such was appointed, by the President of the Council.

In 1689 Colonel Christopher Codrington was appointed Governor-in-Chief, and his commission, granted by William III, and dated 20th October, 1689, authorised him to call assemblies of freeholders and planters within any of the islands jointly and severally to make laws for the public peace, welfare and good government of the said islands, thus providing for separate and federal legislatures. The legislature in St. Christopher and in Nevis, as in the other islands of the government, consisted of two houses, a nominated Council and an elected Assembly, and had secured to it its own peculiar laws and local jurisdiction.

By Letters Patent, dated 26th April, 1816, the Commission originally granted to Sir William Stapleton was revoked, and the Leeward Caribbee Islands formed into two distinct governments, the first comprising Antigua, Montserrat and Barbuda, and the other St. Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd November, 1832, the General Government was restored, Dominica being for the first time included, and a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, with two Lieutenant Governors for St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, and for Dominica respectively, were appointed, each island possessing a Legislative Council and House of Assembly, which continued, under the supervision of the Governor-in-Chief, to legislate for local interests.

In 1866 measures were introduced in each island to alter the constitution, and the two houses then existing were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of ex-officio members, nominees of the Crown, and representatives of the people elected under a limited franchise.

In 1878 the single chamber constitution was repealed in St. Kitts and in Nevis, and the crown colony form of government adopted in its stead, and in 1882 these two islands, with Anguilla, were united into one presidency.

The office of Lieutenant-Governor, which existed until 1870, has been abolished, and the presidency, in the absence thereof of the Governor, is under the immediate supervision of an Administrator.

There is one Executive Council for the presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, certain ex-officio members, and such other persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint. The Legislative Council consists of two official, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members, besides the Administrator. Of the elected members three are representatives of the electoral district of the island of St. Christopher, one represents the island of Nevis and one Anguilla. These members are elected by ballot by voters of the electoral districts they respectively represent. As no residential qualification is necessary it is possible for a person from any one of the islands, provided he is a registered voter and is standing for election, to be elected to represent any one of the other districts. Each island is a separate electoral district.—The
President of the Council enjoys a casting vote in the event of a tie in the votes of members at a meeting. The Council meets at the town of Basseterre in St. Kitts.

**Industry, Trade and Customs**

Sugar is the principal crop in St. Kitts (225,477 tons of cane in 1945 crop from 8,580 acres, 28,410 tons of sugar manufactured). It is grown in the Basseterre Valley and on the lower slopes round the island (the northern side showing the best average yield), and the cane is crushed and sugar produced at a central factory a mile from Basseterre. A light railway for haulage of canes encircles the island.

The only other important crop in St. Kitts is cotton, the lint produced in 1945 being 257,831 lb. on 1,032 acres.

Cotton and coconuts are the chief products exported from Nevis. Small quantities of tomatoes are also exported to Canada during the winter months.

Vegetables and cattle, chiefly for export to St. Kitts and for local consumption, are also produced in Nevis.

Salt is the chief product of Anguilla, and is also produced from ponds at the south-eastern part of St. Kitts, the quantity from St. Kitts and Anguilla in 1945 being 3,069 tons valued at £8,175.

Anguilla also produces cotton in small quantities.

There are no manufacturing industries (other than the manufacture of sugar) in the presidency.

The Customs import tariff is mainly on an ad valorem basis with a surtax of 12½ per cent. A preferential reduction varying in amount, but in most cases equal to one third of the general rate, is accorded to Empire products. The percentage of trade in 1945 is as follows:

| 100            |                        |                         |

**Education**

There are four secondary schools: a Government grammar school for boys in St. Kitts, a girls' high school in St. Kitts and a mixed school in Nevis, both state-aided, and a school by the Roman Catholic Sisters.

There are 32 Government primary schools (17 in St. Kitts, including 5 in Basseterre, 10 in Nevis and 5 in Anguilla), also a Roman Catholic school and a few small private schools.

**St. Kitts**

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the southeastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. A branch of this range encloses the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre the principal town with a population of about 12,000.

Near the town of Sandy Point is Brimstone Hill, strongly fortified and fiercely besieged during the French wars. It is quite isolated and about 750 feet in height.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood. The island is of volcanic formation, and the soil, save in the mountains (where it is clayey) is peculiarly light and porous, sandy yet fertile.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 79°.

The average annual rainfall of St. Kitts is 55 inches.

St. Christopher or St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Liamuiga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies, the settlement having been founded by Mr. Thomas Warner and other settlers, who landed on 28th January, 1623, at the present village of Old Road. Later, French settlements were formed at the two ends of the island. The whole island was finally assigned to England under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

**Nevis**

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 40' N. latitude and 62° 33' W. longitude. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, has a population of about 1,100. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 15,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The soil is very different from that of St. Kitts, being of stiff clay, encumbered everywhere with volcanic boulders.

There are hot mineral springs adjoining the Bath House Hotel near Charlestown. These springs have valuable medicinal properties.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitts, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Kitts) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about 12 miles.

**Anguilla**

Anguilla is situated in 18° 12' N. latitude, and 63° 5' W. longitude about 60 miles N.W. of St. Kitts, and is 16 miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one-and-a-half miles, containing an area of 35 square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

Unlike the mountainous volcanic islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla consists of Oligocene limestone and clay and its highest point is 213 feet above sea level.

The inhabitants are peasant proprietors under the jurisdiction of a medical officer who is also magistrate.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply.

The chief products are sheep and goats and salt. Sea island cotton is cultivated.

MONTSERRAT

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16° 45' N. latitude, and 61° W. longitude, and is about 11 miles in length and 7 miles in the broadest part. Its total area is 32½ square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Chance's Mountain (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island.

Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of about 2,000, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1945, 7 sailing vessels with tonnage of 284 tons, and 1 motor vessel of 37 tons.

Montserrat was colonised by the Irish in 1632; the French took it in 1664 and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1783.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. In 1861 these were replaced by a single Chamber of eight elected and four nominated members.
By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th December, 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th February, 1867, this Chamber was replaced by a Legislative Council of not more than six nominated members. By Act No. 2 of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, the number of members was limited to four. Ordinance No. 4 of 1909 repealed No. 2 of 1902 and limited the tenure of office of the members of the Council to three years. Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number of members to six. Ordinance No. 18 of 1922 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number to eight. By Act No. 16 of 1936 this Council was reconstituted, substituting for the old council a body consisting of the Commissioner as President, two official members, four elected unofficial members, and two nominated unofficial members. Unofficial representation on the General Legislative Council of the Leeward Islands has now been provided for.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, is now reduced to an acreage of about 150 acres, and Sea Island cotton, tomatoes, onions and limes are now the principal products.

Among the other exports may be mentioned lime oils, lime juice, cotton-seed oil, cattle and vegetables.

There are 11 Government schools with a total roll of 2,970 scholars, and 1 denominational school with a roll of 273 scholars.

There is one Government secondary school (mixed) with a roll of 178 scholars.

An extensive road reconstruction scheme is in progress, and the roads throughout the Island are being steadily and systematically improved.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a hurricane; and again on 28th August, 1924, and 12th September, 1928.

A series of seismo-volcanological disturbances occurred during the years 1933 to 1935 causing much damage to stone and mortar buildings.

There is telephonic communication throughout the Island.

Cable & Wireless (West Indies), Limited, operates the wireless station from which services are conducted with the Company's stations at Antigua and St. Kitts, and with Barbados, where connection is made with all parts of the world through the system of Cable & Wireless, Limited.

The island is considered to be one of the most healthy of the Antilles.

The average annual rainfall at the Grove botanic station is about 60 inches.

VIRGIN ISLANDS

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to eastward of and adjacent to Puerto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. latitude, and 64° 39' W. longitude. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dykes, Peter Island, Salt Island, and all others not in the possession of the United States of America. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. A lighthouse is maintained by the Board of Trade on Sombrero, which was first included in the colony in 1904.

The Americans possess St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix.

A civil government and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members, to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government. This ordinance was repealed 1st May, 1902, since when the Governor of the Leeward Islands ordains the laws. There is an Executive Council.

The chief town is Road Town, Tortola, population (estimated) 700, which is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1944, 16 vessels, registered total tonnage 118.

Road Town, which is well built and clean, is provided with well stocked shops and stores. There is a small modern hospital.

The percentage of import trade with the United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empire and the principal foreign countries is 17 per cent., 13 per cent. and 70 per cent. respectively. Under the customs tariff the preferential rate charged on imports from Empire countries is in general two-thirds of the general rate.

Most of the land is peasant owned and cultivated. Sugar cane is also grown and processed into rum which is consumed locally.

The principal industry is stock raising for home consumption and export. Production of charcoal for export is also an important subsidiary industry. A five-year agricultural development programme emphasising livestock improvement and mixed farming is in operation. The programme is financed from colonial development and welfare funds.

Fish are also caught in considerable quantities both for home use and for export.

The peasants take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy, intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands.

Trade is with the Virgin Islands of the United States and to a lesser extent with the other dependencies of the colony and the French island of St. Martin.

British currency is legal tender but American dollars circulate freely at current rates of exchange.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great. The average annual rainfall at Road Town is about 54 inches.

The birth and death rates per 1,000 in 1945 were 29-9 and 19-0 respectively.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (agaves and bromelias) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is bi-weekly by Government motor launch to St. Thomas. Mails are also despatched to St. Thomas nearly every day, letters for Europe being usually sent via Puerto Rico and New York weekly.

Cable & Wireless (West Indies), Ltd., owns and operates cable stations at St. Thomas and St. Croix which are connected by cables with the British West Indies and thence, via Canada, with all parts of the world, through the system of Cable & Wireless, Ltd.

### MALAYA

It is regretted that the inclusion, in this edition of the Colonial Office List, of up-to-date descriptive matter regarding the Malayan territories has not been possible owing to the fact that the termination of military administration, and the creation of a Malayan Union and of the Colony of Singapore, only took place on 1st April, 1946. An up-to-date statement will, however, be published in the next edition. Information relating to these territories before the Japanese occupation will be found in pages 380 to 413 of the Dominions Office and Colonial Office List for 1940.

On the restoration of civil government on 1st April, 1946, Sir Edward Gent became the Governor of the Malayan Union and Mr. (now Sir Franklin) Gimson became the Governor of Singapore. These territories, together with Brunei, North Borneo and Sarawak, come within the co-ordinating authority of a Governor General (Mr. Malcolm MacDonald).

* When the Governor is present in the presidency the Commissioner becomes a member of the Council.

### MALTA

**Situation and Area**

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 94·870 square miles; that of Gozo 23·899 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filflia and Cominotto are mere islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

**History**

The Maltese Islands were inhabited as early as the beginning of the Mousterian cultural period, about 40,000 B.C., by Neanderthal man, of whom remains were discovered in a cave to the south-east of Malta. Traces of paleolithic civilization are not wanting in the islands, and evidence of a neolithic civilization, in the shape of cave dwellings, stone circles, menhirs and dolmens, is found all over the islands. The Phoenicians probably took possession of Malta as soon as they made themselves masters of the Mediterranean Sea. Phoenician remains are few, but there are numerous rock-cut graves of Phoenician type.

At the beginning of the Punic wars the islands were held by Carthage. In the course of the first Punic war they changed hands more than once, but at its conclusion they were still in the possession of the Carthaginians. In 218 B.C. they passed finally to Rome. Under the Romans Malta appears to have enjoyed great prosperity. Diodorus Siculus speaks of the excellence of its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, and its many skilful artificers, and refers to its fertility, and Cicero, in the Verrine orations, speaks of it as abounding in riches and famous for its textile manufactures. Inscriptions show that it enjoyed municipal rights in the time of Hadrian, and an interesting fact in its recorded history is that it was the scene of St. Paul’s shipwreck (Acts xxviii). On the final division of the Empire in 395 A.D., Malta fell to the share of the Byzantine Emperor, and for the next four centuries its history is almost a blank. In the 9th century it was three times invaded by the Arabs, who finally conquered it in 870, the Byzantine garrison being massacred in an insurrection of the inhabitants.

In 1090, Count Roger the Norman, with a handful of men, subjected the islands to Sicily. The Sicilian domination lasted for four hundred years, Norman, Angevin, Aragonese and Castilian ruling in turn. During this time, Malta had Sicilian governors and laws, but there is no record of any extensive Sicilian immigration, and the persistence of the old Semitic names in the parish registers, instituted at this period, stands as further evidence that no great ethnographic changes occurred.

The connection with Sicily was broken in 1530, when the Emperor Charles V gave Malta to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who had been driven from Rhodes by the Turks, and who held Malta until 1798. The loyalty of the Maltese to their new sovereigns, who for the first time were resident in the island, was put to a severe test on several occasions, the most notable being the great siege of 1565, when the Order of St. John, under Grand Master Jean de la Valette, resisted the attacks of the land and sea forces of Soliman the Magnificent. It was after this great feat of
arms that the city of Valletta was built, strong enough to defy the Turkish attacks threatened yearly by the Sultan.

Napoleon Bonaparte invested the island on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda, and, on 12th July, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed.

The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was awarded the George Cross on 15th April, 1942, for the part she played in the Second Great War.

**CLIMATE**

The climate of Malta is very healthy. No excessive periods of hot or cold weather are felt. The climatic conditions are much influenced by the friable nature and sponginess of the layers of rock. The temperature depends on the dominant westerlies. The lowest temperature in 1938, 43·2° F., was registered on 8th January, and the highest, 99·2° F., on the 13th August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in sub-tropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the Sirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) for the last ten years is 58·7° F., and the mean minimum 51·3°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August and September) the mean maximum is 80·6° F., and the mean minimum 70·4°. The mean annual temperature is 65·1° and the mean annual rainfall is 19·9 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous calcareous stone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

**INDUSTRY**

The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, early potatoes, onions, cumin seed and oranges are exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepôt and port of call. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1945, 35 vessels, 29,138 gross tonnage.

**CHIEF TOWNS**

The chief town and capital is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population which, in April, 1931, when a census was last taken, was 51,898. The "Three Cities" (Senglea, Cospicua and Vittoriosa) had a population of 26,419. Città Vecchia (or Notabile, in Maltese Mdina), the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, had a population of 10,032. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), with a population of about 5,531.

**INHABITANTS AND LANGUAGE**

The Maltese language, which is universally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is akin to Arabic. The educated and commercial classes also speak English, and some Italian. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found in Algeria, the Regency of Tunis, Egypt, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

**Banking and Currency**

The legal tender currency is, under Order-in-Council of 24th September, 1886, and Ordinance I of 1929, exclusively British. By Ordinance XLVIII of 1939, however, local sterling currency was placed in circulation in denominations of 1l., 10s., 5s., 2s. 6d., 2s. and 1s., and is legal tender concurrently with the British notes and coins. All notes locally issued are covered by an equal amount of sterling deposited in a Note Security Fund with the Crown Agents for the Colonies. The amount of British notes in circulation on 31st March, 1945, was approximately £1,000,000. Local currency in circulation on the same date was £11,316,888 5s. Od.

The two local banks, the Bank of Malta and the Anglo-Maltese Bank, are now amalgamated under the name of the National Bank of Malta. Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) and the Credit Foncier d'Algerie et de Tunisie both have branches in the island. There is also Sciclunias' Bank which is a private bank. On 31st March, 1945, deposits in the Government Savings Bank, established in 1833, amounted to £9,319,108 with 38,583 depositors.

**Means of Communication**

Motor bus services run between all the towns and villages. The telephone service is under Government control with exchanges at Floriana, Sliema, Rabat, St. Paul's Bay and Gozo. The head office is at Merchants Street, Valletta. The number of exchange lines totals 3,031, with 3,951 stations. Malta is an important station of Cable & Wireless, Ltd., whose direct cables connect with Alexandria (5), Gibraltar (5), Bona (2), Tripoli, Sicily and Zante. Through these cables telegraphic communication is maintained through the company's system with all parts of the world. The company also operates a coast station for communication with ships at sea.

Malta is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is an important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling at any hour, day and night. Owing to lack of accommodation, due to war damage, all civilians wishing to enter Malta must obtain an entry permit from the Lieutenant Governor's office.

There is a direct mail communication with several Mediterranean ports and with England. The rates of postage are as follows:

**Letters**

Local—First oz., 1d.; every additional oz., ½d.
To the United Kingdom, British dominions, protectorates and colonies, Egypt, the U.S.A., Tangier and H.M. Forces—First oz., 2½d.; every additional oz., 1¼d.
To other countries and places—First oz., 3d.; every additional oz., 2d.

**Postcards**

Local, 1d.; Imperial, 2d.; foreign, 2d.
Newspapers

Local, ½d. for each 2 oz.

In the case of a local newspaper exceeding in weight 2 oz., the rate will not be more than 1½d.

Foreign, ½d. for each 2 oz.

Public Works

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works were commenced in 1899, and Cottonera, Sliema, St. Julian’s Msida, Pieta, Kalkara, Zabbar, Hamrun, Qormi, Mdina, Rabat, Tarxien, Pawla, Zejtun, Birkirkara, Balzan and Attard, parts of Lija and Luqa and other places have been drained. Small extensions are also being continually made in new streets as they are opened in the towns and villages. The intercepting sewer to Ghaxaq and Zebugg has been completed and that to Mosta is well in hand. The sewering of the streets of Ghaxaq has been started. The drainage of Gozo has also been commenced and Victoria, Fontana and Għainselem have been drained. Considerable progress has been made in improving the roads and streets in accordance with the exigencies of modern traffic. The main roads are being asphalted. So far 4·85 miles have been surfaced with sheet asphalt and 124·5 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing.

Since 1937 a scheme for the collection and disposal of domestic refuse has been in operation in Valletta, Floriana, Gzira, Msida, Ta’ Xbiex, Sliema and St. Julian’s. In August, 1939, the service was extended to the military areas at St. George’s, St. Andrew’s and Tigne’. Recently the service has been extended also to Albert Town and a part of Hamrun. The refuse collecting fleet serve an approximate aggregate population of 68,000. A pulverising plant has been installed at the refuse disposal centre, Marsa, for treating the refuse collected, which is then utilised as a fertiliser.

The water supply is now extended to all the villages in Malta and Gozo, and works of considerable importance are carried out each year to augment and improve it.

Electric current for lighting and power has been extended to all the towns in Malta, and to all the villages, with the exception of a few of the smaller ones situated at a distance from the supply area. In Gozo current is available to the public in the chief town, Victoria, which has its own generating station, and in the important villages of Xewkija, Għajnsielem, Nadur, Mgarr.

Constitution

A Council of Government, partly elected, was constituted by Letters Patent in 1849, and reconstituted in 1887, the Letters Patent being amended in 1898 and again in 1903.

By Letters Patent dated 14th April, 1921, responsible government was established in Malta.

This constitution was suspended from 1930 to 1932 and again on 2nd November, 1933, the Senate and Legislative Assembly being dissolved from the same date. It was finally revoked by the Letters Patent, dated 12th August, 1936, which were proclaimed in Malta on 2nd September, 1936.

The Letters Patent dated 14th February, 1939, which re-established representative government in Malta, provide for an Executive Council consisting of five ex-officio members and such other persons as the Governor may appoint, and of a Council of Government consisting of five ex-officio members, three official members, 10 elected members and two members nominated by the Governor.

According to the Letters Patent, the English language, as the official language of the British Empire, and the Maltese language, as the language of the people of Malta, are the official languages of Malta. The English language is the official language of administration, and the Maltese language is the official language in all the courts of law in Malta. Provision has been made by ordinance for the use of the English language in any proceedings before any court where any party or any accused person is a person who does not speak Maltese as the principal language to which he is accustomed. Where the proceedings are in a language not known to the party or parties or to the accused, they are translated.

The Maltese language is the language of general intercourse in the islands.

Finance

The revenue from all sources is paid into a consolidated fund, out of which the public service is supplied.

Appointments to public offices in Malta are made by the Governor, subject to the provision of the colonial regulations.

Education and Religion

Elementary education is carried on principally in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are six secondary schools with 1,524 scholars, 101 primary schools with an average enrolment of 38,500 pupils, and an average attendance of 36,200. There is a university (founded in 1769) with an average attendance of about 250 students. The fees are comparatively low, ranging from 142s. to 213s. per annum in the Lyceum and £10 per annum, exclusive of laboratory and other fees, for all lectures in the university. There are 21 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects, with an attendance of 331; 69 trade schools with an attendance of 1,666 and 236 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 4,851. There are numerous private, elementary and secondary schools. The total number of these schools is about 41, with an attendance of about 6,260 pupils. In 1946 an ordinance was enacted making education between the ages of 6 and 14 compulsory; the ordinance will be brought into force gradually, district by district. English and Maltese are the only languages of instruction in the primary schools.

The Roman Catholic religion is by law the religion of the country, but full liberty of conscience and freedom of worship are guaranteed, and persons of any faith may hold any office.

Customs Tariff

Until 1917 only specific duties were levied, the main headings being grain, wine, beer, spirits, cattle, petroleum, sugar and tobacco.

In January, 1917, ad valorem duties were introduced. These rates now vary from 6 per cent. to 40 per cent., and embrace all commodities not already affected by specific duties, and not included in a list of exempted articles which—

(a) Under food and drink shows butter, cheese, coffee, milk (fresh or preserved), eggs in the shell, tea and cocoa, and certain other articles.
(b) Under raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured shows coal, coke, patent fuel and fuel oil, sponges, vegetables and flower seeds and certain other articles.

(c) Under manufactured articles, includes agricultural machines, books, cinema films, wrapping and printing paper, laundry soap of British Empire origin, yarns for lace-making, if of silk (excluding artificial) and linen, twines, certain materials used for cap-making, shoe-making, and bag-making, and certain articles used for divine worship.

(d) Under miscellaneous and unclassified articles, includes articles imported by Government departments—bullion and specie, pedigree animals, fertilizers, and engravings, drawings and paintings representing Maltese views and subjects of local interest.

In 1934 Empire preferential duties were adopted. These duties affect boots and shoes, spirits, leaf tobacco, wheat, flour, cement, laundry soap, arms and ammunition, articles of gold, silver and platinum and plated goods, confectionery and chocolate, furniture and cabinetware, motor vehicles, wireless sets, pianos and organs, and a number of articles falling under the designation of "goods unenumerated". Ad valorem goods enjoy a preference of 5 to 15 per cent. as against the rates for the general tariff.

The general tariff shows an addition over the Empire preferential tariff of 50 per cent. in the case of boots and shoes, 1s. per litre for spirits, and 6d. per kilo for leaf tobacco.

The amount of duty collected in 1945 from specific duties was £972,856 and from ad valorem duties was £446,448.

The value of imports in 1945 from the United Kingdom was £4,392,987, from other parts of the British Empire £1,829,792, and from foreign countries £2,838,623, and from ships' stores, etc., £3,119, the respective percentages of imports being: United Kingdom, 48·46 per cent.; other parts of the British Empire, 20·20 per cent. and foreign countries 31·31 per cent., ships' stores, 0·03 per cent.

The value of domestic exports in 1945 to the United Kingdom was £29,605, to other parts of the British Empire £1,585, to foreign countries £35,965. The respective percentages were: to United Kingdom 44·1 per cent., to other parts of the British Empire 2·4 per cent., to foreign countries 53·5 per cent.

The value of re-exports in 1945 to the United Kingdom was £2,330, to other parts of the British Empire £945, to foreign countries £78,071, as ships' stores £456,473.

The respective percentages for re-exports were: United Kingdom 0·43 per cent., other parts of the British Empire 0·17 per cent., foreign countries 14·5 per cent., ships' stores 84·9 per cent.

All the foregoing figures are exclusive of bullion and specie.

The total percentages of trade compared with the whole import and export trade of the Island (imports, domestic exports and re-exports), for the respective destinations are as follows:

| Per cent. |
|-----------|
| United Kingdom | 45·76 |
| Other parts of the British Empire | 18·94 |
| Foreign countries | 30·54 |
| Ships' stores | 4·76 |

**REVENUE**

The most important sources of revenue are the customs duties, licences, stamp duties, succession and donation duties, fees of office and reimbursements, post office, water and electricity receipts, and land revenue, interest, and Public Lotto profit.
