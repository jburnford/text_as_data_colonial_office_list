NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

SITUATION AND AREA

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shire Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shire) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shire Highlands and Mlanje.

CLIMATE

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the plains and the other of the hills. In the part of the Great Rift Valley which traverses the country from end to end and is occupied for the greater part by Lake Nyasa and the Shire Valley, the climate is hot and unhealthy with temperatures sometimes reaching 120° in the shade just before the rains. Rainfall in this zone does not as a rule exceed 35 inches.

The upland areas are healthier with temperatures varying between a maximum of 97° and a minimum of 40°; at some of the higher elevations temperatures occasionally fall below 40° and frost is sometimes recorded at night. Rainfall in this zone varies from 40 to 100 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

It is bounded on the north by Tanganyika territory, on the west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south, south-west and east by Portuguese East Africa. The eastern boundary with Portuguese East Africa at Lake Nyasa is the eastern or Portuguese coast of the lake and thus the greater part of the Lake Nyasa is contained within the boundaries of the Protectorate. In the absence of adequate survey it is not possible to state accurately the total area but according to latest estimates the land area is believed to be some 36,829 square miles.

HISTORY

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on 16th September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various missionary societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (later Sir H. H. Johnston, G.C.M.G., K.C.B.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting Consul in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on 21st September, 1889, a British protectorate over the Shire districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wahenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe
(later Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shire and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaos at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter sueing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the protectorate in the way of slavetrading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the protectorate secured. In 1893 the name of the protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate," was revived in 1907 by the Order-in-Council which amended the constitution.

**CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION**

The administration of the protectorate, control of which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order-in-Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The laws consist of local ordinances duly enacted with such British acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate courts are held by magistrates and assistant magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa.

**EAST AFRICA GOVERNORS' CONFERENCE**

An account of the constitution of the Standing Conference of East Africa Governors is given in the introduction to Part II.

**POPULATION**

The protectorate is divided into three provinces, Northern, Central and Southern, each under the control of a provincial commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into 14 administrative areas, each in charge of a district commissioner, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shire Highlands. There are 693 Europeans and 1,168 Asiatics in the Blantyre district. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

**Population, 1945**

Europeans, 1,948; Asiatics, 2,804; Africans, 2,178,013.

**INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE**

The chief exportable products of the protectorate are tobacco (flue- and air-cured and dark-fired), tea, cotton, pulses, groundnuts, rice and tung. Amongst minor products exported from the protectorate may be mentioned soya beans, rubber, chillies, cottonseed, potatoes and beeswax. Crops cultivated for home consumption include maize, millets, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, rice, sugar cane, wheat, coffee, pulses, plantains and bananas.

The value of external trade in 1945 was £3,496,885, compared with £3,185,094, in 1944, and £823,823 in 1939. Of this total imports accounted for £1,620,882 and exports £1,876,063.

Principal imports were agricultural machinery and implements (£34,700), cotton manufactures (£728,713), iron and steel and other metal and manufactures thereof (£70,025), provisions (£27,581), vehicles and parts (£110,487). The direction of import trade favoured Great Britain and British possessions to the extent of 76·2 per cent.

Domestic exports included cotton lint (1,608 tons, £114,049), cottonseed (1,608 tons, £2,894), groundnuts (1,141 tons, £28,322), soya beans (600 tons, £8,702), sisal and sisal rope and twine (474 tons, £20,362), tea (6,124 tons, £685,943), tobacco (7,889 tons, £826,000), tung oil (70 tons, £18,935).

Customs revenue is derived from import duties levied ad valorem on c.i.f. value at Beira and varies from 3 per cent. to 50 per cent. Certain imports such as cotton piece goods, tobacco, wine and spirits carry a specific rate of duty. No export duty is levied but there is a cess of 1½d. on each 100 lb. of tobacco and 10d. on each 100 lb. of tea exported. The amount realised from these cesses is returned to the tobacco and tea associations for the benefit of the respective industries.

The following tables show the origin and value of domestic trade imports and exports during the past seven years:

*Note.—Government imports included.*
EDUCATION

In 1944 the Secretary of State approved a five-year plan for the development of the education of all races in the protectorate, and supported it with a grant of £345,000, from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote, to cover capital expenditure up to £65,000, and one-half of the total recurrent expenditure over the five-year period (£280,000). In April, 1945, a new Education Ordinance was enacted to give retrospective effect to the plan as from 1st January, 1945. Its operation is reflected in the increase of the Government grant to missions for African education from approximately £11,500 in 1939 to £56,000 in 1945. The development programme also includes provision for technical training and the extension of secondary education in the case of Africans, scholarships for university education for all races, and experimental work in mass education, particularly in adult literacy, at the Jeanes Centre.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

By a proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling, and by Proclamation No. 11 of 1933, Rhodesian silver coin was declared legal tender.

Banking operations in the protectorate are governed by the Banking Ordinance, 1902.

Two banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., and Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas); the former has branches at Zomba, Limbe and Lilongwe, and the latter has a branch at Limbe.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank.

COMMUNICATIONS

There is a 3 feet 6 inches gauge railway system extending from the port of Beira, in Portuguese East Africa, to Chipoka on Lake Nyasa (496 miles) crossing the Zambesi at Sena (199 miles) by the Lower Zambesi Bridge and passing through Blantyre (353 miles). Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the protectorate, the total mileage being 3,856. The Nyasaland road system is linked up with the Great North Road to Tanganyika territory and Kenya Colony.

There are aerodromes suitable for all types of aircraft at Chileka and Lilongwe, and for light aircraft at Zomba; and seasonal landing grounds are available at all district stations.

The Empire air mail scheme (Southampton-Durban) was inaugurated in June, 1937. Nyasaland is one of the countries participating in the scheme. Letter mails to and from the United Kingdom and other participating countries in the Empire air mail scheme are despatched twice weekly by British Overseas Airways Corporation, and Southern Rhodesian Air Services feeder services, via Beira. The Southern Rhodesian Air Services also operate three air services a week between Salisbury and Blantyre, and a weekly regional service from Salisbury via Nyasaland to Nairobi to connect with the Springbok service.
