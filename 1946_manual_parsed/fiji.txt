FIJI

45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the colony (including Rotuma, 14 square miles) is approximately 7,083 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

CLIMATE

The climate of Fiji is oceanic. The south-east trade-wind blows from May to November and during the remaining months the direction of the wind is variable. Between December and April when hot northerly winds blow from the equator the temperature may occasionally rise as high as 96° and the humidity may reach saturation point. The total average annual rainfall varies in the well defined "wet" and "dry" zones from 60 to 140 inches and the temperature varies from a minimum of 60° to a maximum of 96°.

The highest temperature at Suva in 1944 was 90° on 6th February and 23rd March, and the lowest 59°-3° on 5th June. The total rainfall was 158-85 inches. The average annual rainfall is 120-16 inches. There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a maximum height of 4,300 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and were probably mostly under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger islands, i.e., the leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Gold is produced from the Yanawai district near the south coast of the island of Vanua Levu and from the Tavua and Vunda districts in the north and north-western sections of Viti Levu Island; prospecting activities are in progress in these and other localities. The gold is generally associated with flow-rocks of Tertiary age or their tuffaceous equivalents. It occurs in the free condition, associated with sulphides, and as telluride, two forms of which, sylvanite and nagyagite, have been determined. Base metal ores, carrying low precious-metal values, are known to occur in various parts of the colony, but production has not yet resulted therefrom. The mining industry occupies second place in the industries of the colony. In 1944, 44,712 ounces of gold and 10,794 ounces of silver, valued at a total of £F.427,715, were exported.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Singatoka, the Nandi, and Mba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Ndreketi river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "ndalo" or taro (Colocasia antiquorum).

Fiji is rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

The principal island of the Rotuma group is seven miles long by three miles broad and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore are three islets, Hatana, Hofiuia and Uea. None of these is now inhabited, although people visit them occasionally to cut copra or to collect seabirds' eggs.

HISTORY

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859, Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Europeans set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a parliament elected. The parliament and the government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the ministry latterly governed without the aid of the parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in 1873 the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, in 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in 1874 to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the chief of Mbau, Maafu, who was chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taveuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated 10th October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the
year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, which has a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and its suburbs is estimated at 1,900.

Rotuma was discovered by the Pandora in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. In 1879 the three principal Rotuman chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain and they were annexed 13th May, 1881.

CONSTITUTION

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd April, 1937. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Financial Secretary, together with two other officials and four unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

Under the Letters Patent, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, three ex officio members (official), not more than 13 nominated official members, five European members (three elected and two nominated), five native nominated members and five Indian members (three elected and two nominated).

POPULATION

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. A census was taken on 26th April, 1936, and the population of the colony was:

| Europeans | 4,028 |
|-----------|-------|
| Half-castes | 4,574 |
| Fijians | 97,651 |
| Rotumans | 2,816 |
| Indians | 85,002 |
| Polynesians | 737 |
| Melanesians | 1,616 |
| Micronesians | 126 |
| Chinese | 1,751 |
| Others | 78 |

Total | 198,379 |

The estimated population on 31st December, 1944, was 246,485.

The births among the native population in 1944 totalled 3,808, and the deaths 1,929. The birth rate was 33·65 and the death rate 17·04 per mil.

ADMINISTRATION

Fiji is divided into four administrative districts, each under the control of a district commissioner, who has one or more district officers to assist him. Headquarters are at Suva in the Southern District, Lautoka in the Western District, Lambasa in the Northern District and Levuka in the Eastern District.

Each administrative district contains a number of native provinces, of which there are 15 altogether in the colony. A district commissioner represents the Secretary for Fijian Affairs in matters connected with native administration within his district.

There are town boards at Suva and Lautoka. The Suva Town Board consists of seven official members and six unofficial members, of whom two are European, two Fijian and two Indian. The Lautoka Town Board consists of two official members and seven unofficial members. On each board one of the unofficial members is chairman.

Levuka, the old capital of Fiji, is controlled by a township board with two official and six unofficial members, of whom one is chairman. There are also township boards at Nausori, Mba and Lambasa, each under the chairmanship of a district officer or district commissioner. The board at Nausori has two official and five unofficial members, the board at Mba five official and five unofficial members, and that at Lambasa three official and seven unofficial members.

All members of town and township boards are nominated by the Governor.

The natives retain a large share of self-government. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by annual meetings of the high chiefs and other representatives of each province. A Council of Chiefs makes recommendations on Fijian affairs and bills affecting Fijians may be referred to this council for consideration before being submitted to the Legislative Council. There is a Fijian Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs (chairman), the five native members of Legislative Council, and a legal adviser. The board has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council but provisional approval may be granted by the Secretary for Fijian Affairs. The board is the controlling financial authority in Fijian administration and has power to regulate the conditions of employment of persons in its service. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs is the executive officer of Fijian local government. He is directly responsible to the Governor and, in appropriate matters, to the Legislative Council for the good government of the Fijians as a whole.

In Rotuma, where the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, a district officer is the chief executive authority. He also presides over the Rotuma Court of Justice, styled "The District Officer's Court." The judicial powers are similar to those of a commissioner of the Supreme Court of Fiji and a district commissioner of the colony, but special provision is made for the hearing of indictable cases in Rotuma.

The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which is a chief appointed by the Governor, and is administered by the district officer with the assistance of a council of chiefs, held monthly. The council, an advisory body, consists of the district officer (chairman), the seven district chiefs, the native medical practitioner, one teacher, and one representative from each district.

A Rotuma Regulation Board, consisting of the district officer and between five and 10 Rotumans, makes regulations relating to the good government and well-being of the natives. All such regulations are subject to approval by the Legislative Council of Fiji.

RELIGION

The European and Fijian population is predominantly Christian. Most of the Indians in the colony are Hindus, but there are Muslim and Christian minorities.

The numerically strongest Christian denomination is the Methodist. The Roman Catholic and Seventh Day Adventist missions have established
stations throughout the colony. The Roman Catholic Mission was made a bishopric in 1887. Suva is the centre of the Anglican diocese of Polynesia, and the site of a pro-cathedral. There are Anglican churches at Levuka, Lauoka and Lambassa. A station for Solomon islanders living in Fiji has been established at Wailoku.

There is a Presbyterian church in Suva.

The Methodist and Roman Catholic missions gave the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1940:

- Methodist: 94,960
- Roman Catholic: 17,639

Total: 112,599

CURRENCY AND BANKING

Legislation in 1933 and 1934 provided for the issue of Government currency notes and coin which follow the United Kingdom currency denominations.

The Fiji pound is linked to sterling by law at the fixed rate of £F.111 = £100 sterling.

The circulation at 31st December, 1944, was:

- Notes: £1,871,235
- Coin: 253,653

Total: £2,124,888

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva and Lautoka, and four agencies; the Bank of New Zealand has a branch at Suva.

A Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908. At the end of 1944 deposits totalled £696,498.

COMMUNICATIONS

There is a direct cargo service from the United Kingdom.

There is a regular steam communication with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and U.S.A. Inter-island communication is maintained by regular steamer or cutter services.

Suva and Levuka are ports of registry under the Merchant Shipping Act.

The number of local vessels trading within the colony and holding sea-going certificates from the Marine Board during 1938 was:

| Owned by | No. | Tons. |
|----------|-----|------|
| Europeans | 31  | 921  |
| Natives   | 8   | 136  |
| Others    | 14  | 268  |

Total: 53, 1,325

The number of merchant vessels entered from overseas at the three ports of entry in the colony during the year 1944 was 118, the total registered tonnage being 430,158.

There are two airfields on Viti Levu, one near Nandi on the west coast and the other at Nausori, 13 miles from Suva. A seaplane base has been established at Lauthala Bay, close to Suva. There are air services between Fiji and New Zealand, Australia, Tonga, Western Samoa and the New Hebrides, but time-tables are subject to variation. Plans for trans-Pacific air services provide for regular calls at a port in Fiji.

Postage rates on letters addressed to countries beyond Fiji:

(a) Great Britain and Northern Ireland, British dominions, colonies, protectorates and mandated territories, etc., Egypt, including the Sudan, British Indian postal agencies in French settlements in India, British Indian postal agencies in Tibet, viz., Gyantse, Pharijong and Yatung (Chumbi), New Hebrides (including Banks and Torres Island), Tangier, Tonga and Tristan da Cunha: first ounce, 2½d.; each succeeding ounce, ld.

(b) To other countries in the Postal Union: first ounce, 3d.; each succeeding ounce, 1½d.

Internal postal rates: letters, first ounce 2½d.; each succeeding ounce, ld. Printed papers, for every 2 ounces, ½d.

A parcels post with the United Kingdom was established in 1890. There is also a parcels post with the Australian states, New Zealand, Tonga, India, Canada and the United States of America. The rates of postage are as follows:

The colony entered the Postal Union in 1891.

The imperial postal order system has been adopted by this colony.

A wireless telegraphy service is operated in the colony. There are stations at Suva and Lautoka in the island of Viti Levu, at Lambasa, Savusavu and Nambouwalu (in the island of Vanua Levu and at Waiyevo (Taveuni), Levuka (Ovalau), Lomaloma and Lakemba (Lau) and Rotuma. Telephone exchanges have been established at Suva, Nausori, Lautoka, Mba, Nandi, Tavua, Vatukoula, Navua, Levuka, Savusavu and Taveuni. Suva is connected by telephone line to Nausori, Vunidawna, Tailevu, Navua, Nandoga, Nandi, Lautoka, Mba, Tavua, Vatukoula and Rakiraki.

The cable station owned and operated by Cable and Wireless, Limited, at Suva connects the colony by submarine cable with New Zealand, Australia and Canada and thence with all parts of the world through the company's system.

An external wireless service linking the colony directly with Australia is operated by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia), Limited.

There is no railway in the colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. owns various tramlines connecting with estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. On Viti Levu a circular all-weather motor road 323 miles long connects Suva with Tailevu, Tavua, Mba, Lautoka, Nandi, Singatoka and Navua. Branch roads afford access to other centres of settlement, including the mining area of Vatukoula and the hill station at Nandarivatu.

There are 19 miles of road on Ovalau and 40 miles on Taveuni.

On the island of Vanua Levu there are two disconnected road systems, one following the coast for 30 miles from Savusavu and the other connecting Lambasa with settlements in the vicinity.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Health

The Central Medical School in Suva, which has a teaching staff of one whole-time medical officer, who is the principal, and 14 honorary lecturers, was founded in 1884 for the training of Fijian youths; but since 1928 its benefits have been
available to other Western Pacific territories, and its graduates, now numbering nearly 300, include Fijians, Fiji Indians, Western Samoans, Eastern Samoans, Tongans, Gilbertese, Ellice Islanders, Solomon Islanders, New Hebrideans, Rotumans, Nauruans, Cook Islanders and Nieuw Islanders.

From this school are sent out native medical practitioners who work among their own people, not only treating the sick and attending to native health conditions in the villages, but also forming a bridge for the conveyance of European medical thought to the native mind: a system which has been responsible more than any other single factor for winning the confidence of the Fijians in modern medicine and surgery.

In several of the provinces, hospitals and dispensaries for the use of Fijians and others have been opened and in each of these is a native medical practitioner either in sole charge or acting as house surgeon under the European medical officer. In addition, there are well equipped general hospitals for all races at Suva, Lautoka, Levuka and Lambasa. There is a public mental hospital in Suva, and on the island of Makongai a colony for the segregation and treatment of those afflicted with leprosy.

All these institutions are owned and maintained by the Government. The hospital at Makongai deserves special mention, as it has achieved world fame because of its success in the treatment of leprosy. The nursing system there, the personnel of which is drawn from the Roman Catholic Order of Mary, is of outstanding merit.

In 1923, with the assistance of £19,500 subscribed by the public, the Colonial War Memorial Hospital was erected on a commanding site within the town boundaries of Suva. It is controlled by Government and staffed with three resident medical officers and an adequate number of trained and pupil nurses. It now accommodates 209 patients of all races, and may soon be enlarged by the addition of new obstetric, isolation and mental observation sections. Its equipment and general facilities conform with the standards of modern general hospitals in other countries.

A teaching branch of the Colonial War Memorial Hospital which is of ever-growing importance is its school for training non-European nurses in midwifery as well as in general and public health nursing. The number of pupil nurses has recently been increased to 50, and a sister-tutor, trained under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation, has been appointed to take charge of the enlarged school under the general supervision of the nursing superintendent. A further step of far-reaching importance was the decision of Government to permit pupils from other Pacific administrations to take their course of training in Suva. This has made this training school in every way a fitting complement of the Central Medical School.

Owing to the high death-rate among Fijian infants and young children, the Government instituted in 1927 a special infant welfare organisation. It is based on putting as much responsibility as possible into the hands of the natives, and has proved most successful. Since its inception there has been a steady decline in the infant mortality rate of the Fijian people. The work of the trained staff, which is both European and native, is greatly helped by a system under which, in almost every village, women volunteer workers are appointed to take care of the children of that village.

In recent years a special mosquito control branch of the Medical Department has been established. Its first task was to undertake clearing and drainage work in the vicinity of ports and airfields so as to lessen the danger of the introduction of the *anopheles* mosquito from the malarial areas to the north of Fiji, with which there was a great increase of air and sea traffic during the war. A campaign to eradicate the local filaria-carrying mosquito has now been started.

**Education**

The Education Ordinance, Cap. 103, passed in 1929, constituted the Department of Education and established the Board of Education. The board consists of the Director of Education and eight other members nominated by the Governor. The ordinance gives very wide powers to the board to control all phases of education. The most important are the registering of schools and teachers, the allocating of grants-in-aid, the determining of the instruction to be given and to advise the Governor on the establishment of education districts. Only two such districts, Suva and Levuka, have been established.

The Education Rating Ordinance, Cap. 104, authorises the levying of a special rate in these two districts to meet one-half the net cost incurred by the Government in maintaining Government schools within the limits of the districts.

There are two grammar schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, with hostels attached, and a public school in Levuka, all under Government control. The roll number during 1944 at the two grammar schools was 354. The roll in 1944 for the Levuka public school was 162 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School is intended to provide for the higher education of natives, and is maintained from public revenue. The school is at present in temporary quarters at Nanukuloa. A permanent site has been chosen near Londoni to replace the former one at Nasinu, which was requisitioned during the war for a military hospital.

Schools for primary education may be conducted by any properly constituted authority or by the Government. Five provincial schools have been established by the Government at Lau, Taveuni, Londoni, Kandavu and Sawani, in charge of European headmasters.

At the end of 1944 there were 206 Fijian assisted schools with rolls totalling 15,886 and 94 Indian assisted schools with rolls totalling 9,606.

In 1944 there were three training institutions for teachers, one maintained by the Government, two by the Methodist Mission and one by the Roman Catholic Mission. There were 60 male students and 40 female.

**Labour**

The Labour Department is in charge of labour welfare and derives its status and authority from the Labour (Welfare) Ordinance, 1941. The executive staff consists of the Commissioner of Labour, one labour officer and two labour assistants. The main function of the department is to promote harmony in industrial relations and to safeguard and promote the general welfare of workmen. No provision has yet been made for old age pensions or other conventional kinds of social security, but an undertaking was given recently in the Legislative Council that legislation dealing with old age pensions would be introduced, and the matter is under active consideration. In the meantime destitution is dealt with
by assistance from public funds. The funds are administered in the case of Europeans and persons of mixed descent by a Relief Board; in the case of Indians by the district commissioners; and in the case of certain Pacific islanders by the Fijian Affairs Office. The Industrial Associations Ordinance, Cap. 79, and the Industrial Disputes (Arbitration and Conciliation) Ordinance, Cap. 80, provide machinery for collective bargaining, which has begun to make some headway. Workmen's Compensation is provided in respect of a limited number of occupations by the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance, Cap. 81. The question of widening the scope of the ordinance to take in all workmen is now under consideration. The colony has agreed to be bound by the recommendations of the 1944 International Labour Conference regarding minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories, and the necessary legislation to implement the recommendations where necessary is in course of preparation. Existing legislative enactments cover a number of international labour conventions, including the employment of women and children, forced labour and minimum wages.

Fuller particulars may be found in the annual reports on the social and economic progress of the people of Fiji, and in the annual reports of the medical, education and labour departments.

Fuller particulars are to be found in the Annual Trade Reports.

### Industries, Trade and Customs

The trade and commerce of the colony depend on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture and export of sugar; (2) the mining of gold; and (3) the cultivation, manufacture and export of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut).

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported.

Exports of the produce of the colony in 1944 totalled £1,935,564. The principal exports were sugar, gold and copra. The quantities and value exported in 1944 were sugar, 67,252 tons, value £1,035,616; gold, 44,712 oz., value £426,452; copra, 18,927 tons, value £352,494.

The other principal exports in 1944 consisted of trochus shell, 305 tons, value £32,253; raw rubber, 179,958 lb., value £19,220; bananas, 74,258 bunches, value £18,565; molasses, 15,590 tons, value £15,590; biscuits, 561,004 lb., value £14,584; soap, 3,367 cwt., value £5,825; hides, 3,773, value £4,579.

The rice crop is insufficient for local demands and the importation of this commodity was 411 tons in 1944.

Dairying is an established industry.

There are in Suva a soap factory and a biscuit factory which supply a considerable proportion of the local requirements and enjoy an increasing trade with other groups in the Pacific.

The customs tariff is, in general, on an ad valorem basis, duty being assessed on the value of goods at the port of shipment. Practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British Empire material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the value of the goods, and that the final processes of manufacture are performed within the British Empire. A few special items require 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. Empire content.

The total trade of the colony in 1944 was £4,594,494.
