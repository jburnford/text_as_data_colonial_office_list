SEYCHELLES

DESCRIPTION

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. latitude 4° and 10°. The total area of the colony and its dependencies is 156½ square miles. The number of islands under the Seychelles Government is 92.

The death rate in 1945 was 10·89 per 1,000; the birth rate in 1945 being 25·42 per 1,000.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to contain 55½ square miles. It has about 105 miles of good roads and paths, and communication between all the districts of the island is easy. The estimated population of Mahé in 1945 was 29,063.

It is distant from Mauritius 934, from Madagascar 600, and from Zanzibar 970 miles. It is healthy and entirely free from malaria. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 84, and falls frequently at night to 72, and the records taken on the hills are several degrees lower. The rainfall at Victoria, was, in 1945, 77·84 inches. The average over the past 30 years is 96·6 inches.

The island rises abruptly from the sea, and the highest peak reaches the elevation of 2,993 feet. Victoria, the capital of the island, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a safe and commodious harbour, provided with a lighthouse showing a white flash of 0·7 second duration every 6·7 seconds.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse (900 acres); Félicité (689 acres); North Island (525 acres); St. Anne (500 acres); Providence (500 acres); Frigate (700 acres); Denis (340 acres); Cerf (290 acres); and Bird or Sea Cow Island (160 acres).

The following islands are also dependencies of Seychelles:—The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. François Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island.

The island of Coëtivy, formerly a dependency of Mauritius, was transferred to Seychelles by Letters Patent in 1907, and Farquhar Island in 1922.

HISTORY

The islands are believed to have been discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro Mascarenhas, in 1505, but the discovery was not apparently followed by any attempt at colonisation.

Previous to the French occupation they were the resort of pirates or corsairs who infested the Indian Ocean, some of whose names are borne by descendants in Mahé at the present time.

Under the government at Mauritius of Labourdonnais, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1743, and M. Picault, who took possession of the islands in the name of the King of France, called the principal island...
Mahé. In 1756 the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Moreau de Séchelles, who was Controller-General of Finance under Louis XV, from 1754 to 1756.

The natural resources of the islands and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and other inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and refitment, but on 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcome, of His Majesty’s ship “Orpheus.”

The last French Governor, M. De Quincy, who was born at Paris in November, 1748, became, after Lieutenant Sullivan, R.N., who had been placed in charge, had left, the first Agent Civil under the British Government. M. De Quincy’s reign as French Governor lasted 20 years. He remained for 18 years in the service of the British Government, and died on 10th July, 1827.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Captain Ferrier, of His Majesty’s ship “Albion,” but it was not until the capture of Mauritius in 1810, that Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that colony. From 1794 to 1810 Seychelles, though nominally a British colony, seems to have been administered as a French colony, and all Civil Status Acts ran in the name of the French Government. A Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed in 1872, when the finances of the Seychelles were separated from those of Mauritius. The title of the head of the Government was changed from that of Civil Commissioner to that of Chief Civil Commissioner. The powers of the board were further enlarged in 1874 by another Order-in-Council.

The increasing importance of these islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in the constitution of the Government, and in December, 1888, an Order-in-Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council. In 1897, by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, the Administrator was given full powers as Governor, and Seychelles was practically separated from Mauritius. The separation was completely carried out by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, by which Seychelles was erected into a separate colony under its own Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

The Legislative Council now consists of six official and six unofficial nominated members with the Governor as President. As soon as possible, provision is to be made for three of the unofficial members to be elected.

During the war steamer communications have been irregular but it is hoped that the pre-war monthly schedules of the British India Steam Navigation Company and the K.P.M. line will be resumed at an early date.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. Direct cables to Aden and Colombo were completed in 1922. Cable communication with every part of the world is now provided by Cable and Wireless, Ltd.

Cable and Wireless, Ltd., also maintains a coast station at Victoria for communication with ships at sea.

**SAVINGS BANK AND CURRENCY**

A Government Savings Bank was established in March, 1897, and at the close of the year 1944, the amount standing to the credit of depositors was Rs. 2,409,466. Seventy-five per cent. of the Savings Bank funds are invested.

The legal tender currency is Seychelles notes and coins and Mauritius subsidiary coinage. Mauritius notes and Indian notes and coins hitherto in free circulation have now been demonetised. Accounts are kept in rupees and cents.

**PRODUCTS AND INDUSTRIES, TRADE AND CUSTOMS, ETC.**

In 1944 the chief exports were copra, 4,028 tons, guano, 6,978 tons; essential oils, 26,845 kilos; tortoise-shell, 314 kilos; vanilla, 1,328 kilos, and calipee, 2,425 kilos.

In Victoria there is a botanic garden containing many interesting tropical plants.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated coco-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made by the natives.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelles administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are, however, to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands.

The revenue is derived principally from specific and ad valorem import duties, licences, an income tax on a graduated scale and a tax on urban property and stamps. An export duty of Rs. 1 a ton is levied on guano, prepared fertiliser, and mangrove bark, and at the rate of 10 per cent. on the f.o.b. price of copra, cinnamon bark and cinnamon leaf oil. Special export duties are at present levied on vanilla and patchouli. The customs tariff is partly ad valorem and specific and provision for Empire preference has been included since 1932.

The percentage of trade in 1938 and 1944 was as follows:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
