ST. HELENA

Situation, Area, etc.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean 700 miles south-east of Ascension and 1,200 miles from the coast of Africa, in 15° 55' S. latitude and 5° 42' W. longitude. It is 104 miles long and 64 broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 14 days, and from Capetown, five days.

The estimated population in 1945 was 4,942, as compared with 3,995 at the time of the 1931 census.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the north-west of the island, with a population of about 1,500. The climate is mild and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 84°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall for the years 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 was as follows:

The island is normally very healthy but there was an outbreak of infantile paralysis in 1945. The death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants was for 1939, 10°60; 1940, 9°98; 1941, 9°57; 1942, 11°11; 1943, 7°01; 1944, 7°21; and 1945, 13°15.

The birth-rate per 1,000 inhabitants was for 1939, 26°61; 1940, 33°33; 1941, 33°39; 1942, 31°07; 1943, 39°26; 1944, 31°05; and 1945, 36°82.

HISTORY

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander, Juan de Nova Castell, May, 1502. The Portuguese appear to have kept the situation of the island a secret from other European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. After Captain Cavendish's visit the island became a port of call for ships of various nations voyaging between the East Indies and Europe. In 1633, Jacques Specz formally annexed it on behalf of the States General; but no attempt to occupy it was made by the Dutch. It was annexed and occupied by Captain John Dutton, who was sent out by the East India Company for the purpose with an expedition which arrived at St. Helena on 5th May, 1639. The first official authorisation of the Company's occupation occurs in a charter dated 1661. In January, 1673, the Dutch seized it, but they were
driven out in May by Captain Munden of the English navy. A Charter was issued by Charles II to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament in 1833.

**EDUCATION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT**

The schools of the Island originally consisted of two groups of primary schools—church schools of the Ceylonese community, and Government schools. In 1941 an agreement was reached and embodied in the Schools Amalgamation Ordinance, 1941, under which both groups are administered by the Board of Education, on which the trustees of the church schools are represented by three members out of six. The amalgamation has now begun to bear fruit and it is difficult to distinguish now between the former Government schools and those originally in the control of trustee bodies. There are nine schools in the colony and the total number of scholars at the end of 1945 was 1,069. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 10 of 1941. A secondary school was established in 1946. No fees are payable at any school.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for the year 1945 was £1,525 and £1,646 respectively.

**INDUSTRY, TRADE AND CUSTOMS**

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the south-east for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the Red Sea route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818 a law was passed that all children born in future in the island should be free.

Apart from supplying provisions to ships the island has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre (phormium tenax). The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost, the yield was only about three tons of fibre, though, under present conditions of working, 10 tons of phormium leaves give one ton of fibre and a quarter-ton of tow. The industry was re-started with the help of a grant from the home Exchequer. The Government mill was opened in 1907, and is now leased to Messrs. Solomon & Co. of this colony.

There are six mills operating in the island, the amount of fibre and tow exported in 1944 being 909 and 324 tons respectively. A rope and twine industry was also established in 1925, the amount of rope and twine exported during 1944 being 34 tons.

A lace making industry was established in August, 1907, with the help of a grant from Imperial funds.

Another industry, that of the export of lily bulbs to England, has been started and there is every prospect of it proving of benefit to the colony, particularly to small growers.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war, was 21 in 1944. It is a port of registry and there are facilities for the supply of water to ships.

The Government Savings Bank was established in 1865 (the amount standing to credit of depositors on 31st December, 1944, was £66,194), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at par.

There are preferential and general customs tariffs, the duties being mainly ad valorem. A number of essential commodities, such as flour, rice, etc., are exempt from duty if they are the growth, produce or manufacture of the British Empire.

**MEANS OF COMMUNICATION**

Under normal conditions steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of four weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal, steamers arrive from thence at the same interval and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 14 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India and British possessions is 3½d. for the first ounce and 1½d. for each additional ounce; to other parts of the world 4½d. for the first ounce and 1½d. for each additional ounce. There is no internal post, but there are approximately 75 miles of telephone lines, constructed by the Colonial Government with the assistance of a loan from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. Cable & Wireless, Ltd., owns and operates a cable station whence cables connect with Cape Town and Ascension, thus linking the colony with all parts of the world through the company's system.

**CONSTITUTION**

The government is administered by a Governor aided by Executive and Advisory Councils.

The Governor alone makes ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by order of His Majesty in Council.

**ASCENSION**

The island of Ascension, 34 square miles in area, lying in the South Atlantic, latitude 7° 53' S. and longitude 14° 18' W., was taken possession of in 1815, and, until 1922, it was under the supervision of the Admiralty and a small naval station was maintained there.

By Letters Patent dated 12th September, 1922, it was made a Dependency of St. Helena and placed under the control of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Ascension is a barren, rocky peak of purely volcanic origin, and destitute of vegetation, except at the highest point (2,870 feet), but has been cultivated to an extent permitting the maintenance of about 600 sheep and cattle. It is famous for its turtles, large numbers of which are caught between December and May.

Cable and Wireless Limited owns and operates an important cable station which connects the Colony with St. Helena, Sierra Leone, St. Vincent, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, and through these places over the Company's system with all parts of the world.

In 1942 the Government of the United States of America, by arrangement with His Majesty's Government, established an air base which became of considerable importance during the period of hostilities.

Under normal conditions the Government of St. Helena is represented in the Dependency by the local manager of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., who is appointed a Justice of the Peace and Resident Magistrate for this purpose. After the establishment of the air base a separate post of "St. Helena General Representative" was created.

Population at 1931 census was 188, of whom 126 were St. Helenians. The number of St. Helenians was considerably increased after the establishment of the air base.

**TRISTAN DA CUNHA**

By Letters Patent dated 12th January, 1938, Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible and Gough Islands were made dependencies of St. Helena. The three latter islands are uninhabited.

Tristan da Cunha is the principal of a group of islands lying in latitude 37° 6' S., longitude 12° 2' W., about midway between South Africa and South America. It is an extinct volcano rising to 7,640 feet above sea level, with a crater lake near its summit. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. When the garrison was withdrawn in 1817, William Glass, a corporal of artillery, and his wife elected to remain, and they were joined by two ex-navy men, Alexander Cotton and John Mooney, and these, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement, which is on the north-west of the Island, where there is a comparatively level area about 9 miles long and 1½ miles broad, and about 100 feet above the sea. After some years, the five unmarried settlers contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885.

In January, 1904, the Island was visited by H.M.S. "Odin" in order to ascertain whether the Islanders would accept the offer of the Cape Government to settle them in the Cape Colony, but out of eleven families only three families elected to go. The Islanders are liable from time to time to privations. In March, 1907, owing to information indicating probability of failure of supplies, relief was sent by His Majesty's Government by the "Greyhound" chartered at Cape Town. On this occasion also the inhabitants were unwilling to leave the Island and the
Rev. J.G. Barrow, a clergyman who had gone to the Island in April, 1906, reported that though there is sure to be privation from time to time, it does not cause absolute distress. (See correspondence presented to Parliament in Cd. 3093 and Cd. 3764.)

Arrangements are usually made for the Island to be visited by a ship at least once a year.

January, February, and March are the best months for visiting the Island. It is in these months that weather at times becomes so settled that the Islanders are able to make visits to Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands, which are some 20 miles off. They also are often able to visit these Islands in November to gather eggs, etc.

In 1945 the Islanders numbered 230, nearly all of whom were born in the Island.

The inhabitants have, between them about 250 head of cattle, about 750 sheep and a stock of poultry. Potatoes do well and crops are got in annually. Potatoes form the staple article of diet. Fish of good quality is obtainable in plenty. During the nesting season penguin and albatross eggs are gathered. For flour, sugar, jam and other prepared or manufactured food the island is dependent upon external assistance. Despite the limited choice of diet no evidence of malnutrition or deficiency disease is observable. Apple trees are in fair number, and bear well; there are also a few fig trees, but they do not fruit. The tree of the Island which apparently is a juniper, and upon which the Islanders are dependent for their wood for fuel, is getting scarce in the neighbourhood of the settlement, and has to be collected from increasing distances where the supply is still abundant.

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts maintains a Chaplain on the Island.

During the war detachments of the Royal Navy and the South African Air Force were stationed on the Island to maintain a meteorological and wireless station. These detachments were withdrawn early in 1946, but the Government of the Union of South Africa are maintaining an experimental meteorological station on the island which is manned by three members of the South African Meteorological Department.
