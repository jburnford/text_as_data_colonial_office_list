CEYLON

SITUATION AND AREA

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 50' N. lat., and 79° 42' and 81° 53' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 270 miles; its greatest width 140 miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangamankanda on the east. Its area is 25,332 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldivian Archipelago, 400 miles south-west of Ceylon, made up of 18 groups—known as atolls, or islets—but for centuries past arranged for administrative purposes in 13 groups, which are sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually.

The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for nearly eight centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coconut palms and yield millet, fruit and coconut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population enumerated at the census 1931 was 79,281, including 245 Borahs, 92 Malayalees, 64 Ceylon Moors, 2 Ceylon Tamils, and 2 Sinhalese who were at Malé the principal occupations are fishing, coir and lace making, toddy drawing, carpentry and cultivation. Malé, the residence of the Sultan and the capital of the islands, is a little over three miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

CLIMATE

For a tropical country the climate of Ceylon is generally comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains is much less oppressive than in India.

In the low-country the annual mean temperature is about 80° F. to 82° F. At higher altitudes it falls off, at a fairly steady rate, about 1° F. for each 300 feet rise in altitude. At Kandy, 1,650 feet above sea-level, it is 77° F., at Diyalawana, 4,100 feet, it is 68° F., and at Nuwara Eliya, the chief hill-station in the island, 6,200 feet, it is 60° F.

A noteworthy feature everywhere in Ceylon is the smallness of the variation in the mean monthly temperatures throughout the year. At Colombo the mean temperature during the coolest months, November to February, is 79° F., which is only 3° cooler than that during the warmest months, April and May. At Galle the mean annual range of temperature is similar in amount. In the north and east this range is only a little higher; for example, at Trincomalee, the temperature during the coolest months, December and January, is 78° F., and during the warmest, May to July, is 85° F.

This uniformity of temperature is not, however, accompanied by a similar uniformity in climatic comfort or discomfort. There is a well-marked season of the year, known as the "hot" season, generally March to May, when conditions are best described as "sticky." Partly because of increased humidity, but mainly because of the lack of wind, particularly at night, climatic conditions become uncomfortable. Most Europeans choose this season of the year for their annual holiday in the hills. With the arrival of the south-west monsoon, although neither temperature nor humidity fall appreciably in the south-west of Ceylon, conditions become more comfortable.

The daily variation of temperature, the rise to a maximum in the middle of the day and the fall to a minimum at night, is well marked in Ceylon. Its magnitude is very much affected by the direction of the prevailing wind. In the southwest of the island the range is low during the south-west monsoon, and high during the north-east monsoon and intermonsoon periods, while in the east and north-east the diurnal range is lowest during the north-east monsoon. At Colombo the mean diurnal range varies from 8° F. between June and September to 15° F. in February, with a yearly mean range of 11° F., while at Trincomalee, although the yearly mean is the same, 11° F., the lowest mean diurnal range is 6° F., in December and January, and the highest, 15° F., in August and September. Inland the mean diurnal range averages about 16° F.

During the "cool" season, which may be taken as roughly November or December to
February, the nights, even in the low-country, are frequently cool, particularly in the southwest of the island. The temperature occasionally falls below 65° F., or even 60° F., in the low-country, while the minimum temperature at Nuwara Eliya sometimes falls below freezing point. At such times the days are bright and sunny, while the air is dry, so that the day temperatures are as high as, or even higher than at other seasons of the year.

The highest temperatures are experienced in the districts to the north or north-east of the hills, but a temperature of 100° F. is rarely experienced. The highest recorded air temperature in Ceylon was 103° 7° F., at Trincomalee.

The relative humidity varies generally from about 70 per cent. during the day to about 90 per cent. at night, rising as the temperature falls. Owing to the high average temperature in the low-country, the absolute humidity there is high.

The annual average rainfall varies from below 40 inches in the driest zones, in the north-west and south-east of the island, to over 200 inches at certain places on the south-western slopes of the hills. The chief rainy seasons extend from April to June and from October to January, but as there is a sharp contrast between the windward and leeward sides of the island during both monsoons, particularly the south-west, it is difficult to summarise the rainfall as a whole in a brief note.

**History**

The authentic history of the island begins at the sixth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the north of India established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

In the sixteenth century the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1796 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1802, Ceylon was constituted a separate colony. In 1815 war was declared against the Sinhalese Government of the interior; the last Kandyan king was taken prisoner, and the whole island came under the rule of the British.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by a State Council consisting of 50 members elected for territorial constituencies, three *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, Legal Secretary and Financial Secretary) called Officers of State, and eight members nominated by the Governor. The State Council concerns itself with administration as well as with legislation. The Council is divided into seven executive committees in charge of various groups of public affairs.

The departments of government are divided into 10 groups. Three of these groups are in charge of the Chief Secretary, the Legal Secretary and the Financial Secretary. The remaining seven groups are in charge of members of the State Council who are elected as chairmen of the various executive committees and who are styled ministers. The ministers with the officers of state form the Board of Ministers.

All Ceylonese, both male and female, of a minimum age of 21, are included in the franchise. British subjects not domiciled in Ceylon are allowed to qualify for the franchise in accordance with the hitherto existing constitution, or on their furnishing satisfactory evidence of five years' residence and a declaration of permanent settlement in the island.

By an Order in Council of May, 1946, Ceylon has been granted a new Constitution. The State Council will be replaced by a Parliament consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. A Cabinet, under the leadership of a Prime Minister, will take the place of the present Committees. The three offices of state will be abolished. When this constitution comes into operation Ceylon will be virtually fully self-governing in internal affairs.

**Population, Area and Statistics**

According to the decennial census taken in 1931 the population was 5,312,548, an increase of 17.94 per cent. on the population enumerated in 1921. The details of the population were as follows (including the military, shipping, estates, and miscellaneous):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 1,448,648  |
| Central Province          | 953,395    |
| Southern Province         | 771,283    |
| Northern Province         | 399,094    |
| Eastern Province          | 213,980    |
| North-Western Province    | 546,988    |
| North-Central Province    | 97,365     |
| Province of Uva           | 303,419    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa  | 578,368    |
| Miscellaneous             | 8          |

Total: 5,312,548

The population of the principal towns, exclusive of the military and the shipping, was as follows:

- Colombo, 284,155;
- Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, 34,288;
- Negombo, 25,291;
- Moratuwa, 32,409;
- Kalutara, 14,280;
- Kandy, 37,147;
- Jaffna, 45,708;
- Galle, 38,424;
- Matara, 18,893;
- Batticaloa, 11,585;
- Trincomalee, 10,160;
- Kurunegala, 10,467;
- Badulla, 9,849.

The estimated population of Ceylon in 1945 was 6,060,000.

The number of Indian labourers on estates in 1944 was about 649,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice.

The entire area of the island is 25,332 square miles. About one quarter of this area, after deducting backwaters, etc., is under cultivation. Some 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,262 feet above sea level. The approximate acreages under the most important products are:

| Product       | Acres   |
|---------------|---------|
| Coconuts      | 1,238,000|
| Rice          | 850,000  |
| Tea           | 549,571  |
| Grain (other than rice) | 105,000 |
| Rubber        | 637,083  |
| Areacanats    | 69,000   |
| Cinnamon      | 26,000   |
| Cacao         | 34,000   |
| Tobacco       | 14,000   |

At the end of 1945 the number of plumbago mines reported to be working was 58. The amount of plumbago exported during the year was 156,409 cwts., valued at rs. 3,564,334.

* By "Miscellaneous" are meant persons enumerated in the Great and Little Basses.
The minimum upset price of Crown land is rs. 25 to 40 per acre. 814 acres were granted and sold by the revenue officers in 1944.

The revenue is principally derived from customs duties, land sales, licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of arrack and toddy rents), salt (which is a Government monopoly), income tax, stamps and postal receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt for the financial year 1943-44 was rs. 3,536,716. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed on an import duty of rs. 4 per cwt.

The local revenues raised by the municipalities of Colombo, Kandy and Galle, by the provincial and district road committees, by the urban councils which have been established in the towns of Dehiwala—Mt. Lavinia, Kolonnawa, Kotte, Moratuwa, Negombo; Beruwala, Kalutara, Panadure, Gampola, Hatton-Dikoya, Nawalapitiya, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Ambalangoda, Matare, Weligama, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Bandarawela, Ratnapura, Kegalla; and the local board of Minuwangoda; and by village committees amounted in 1944 to rs. 16,498,836. The revenue collected by the sanitary boards amounted to rs. 777,827.

The municipal debt outstanding on 31st December, 1944, was rs. 15,414,639. Of this amount rs. 6,391,654 is the balance of the loan borrowed from the Government for the Colombo drainage works, rs. 5,809,279 for the Colombo water works and rs. 2,899,672 for the Colombo municipal tramways. Rs. 253,367 is the balance of loans obtained by the municipality of Galle for the construction of waterworks and the installation of an electric lighting scheme, and rs. 60,667 is the balance of the loans borrowed by the municipality of Kandy for model dwellings, water supply and paving Meda Ela.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—export, 1884, 2,392,963 lb.; 1900, 149,264,602 lb.; 1934, 218,694,956 lb.; 1938, 235,739,097 lb.; 1945, 232,003,365 lb.

There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. In 1898, 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber; in 1906, 100,000 acres; and in 1944, 637,083 acres.

The value of the products of the coconut palm exported in 1945 was rs. 68,617,782. During the past few years greater attention has been given to the cultivation of coconuts, and large areas of land formerly occupied with cinnamon are now planted in this crop. The value of cacao exported in 1944 was rs. 2,283,238, and of cinnamon rs. 4,684,796.

The chief imports are rice from British India and Burma, valued at rs. 10,151,828, and from other countries (Brazil, Egypt and United States of America), valued at rs. 52,358,192, coal valued at rs. 14,582,572, chiefly from British India and British South Africa, and textiles valued at rs. 100,161,051, chiefly from United States of America, United Kingdom and British India.

**LAW AND JUSTICE**

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by local ordinances. Kandyan law, Muslim law and the Thesawalamai also prevail among Kandyans, Muslims and the Tamil inhabitants of Jaffna respectively. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian penal code, and the law of criminal and civil procedure and of evidence has also been codified.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior courts both in civil and criminal cases; by the magistrates' courts and courts of requests, which dispose, respectively, of minor criminal and civil suits; and by the district courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the magistrates' courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases. In addition to these there are the village committees, and village tribunals, instituted under the Village Communities Ordinance, with powers to deal with minor offences and small claims. Village councils, established under the Irrigation Ordinance, deal with minor irrigation offences. The village committees have worked well and are thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people. Besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, they have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make by-laws, subject to the approval of the Governor, relating to their village economy.

**EDUCATION**

Education in the island has undergone a far-reaching change with the introduction on 1st October, 1945, of the scheme of free education, from the kindergarten to the university. Government schools of every type are now free schools. Of the assisted English schools 177 joined the scheme on 1st October, 1945. Those that did not come into the scheme have been allowed time up to 30th September, 1948, to decide whether to come into it or not. Schools which elect not to join the scheme then will be run as independent institutions receiving no aid whatsoever from Government.

With the advent of free education the distinction between English schools (fee-paying) and Sinhalese and Tamil schools (free) has been done away with. All schools are now graded as:—

| Grade          | Standard |
|----------------|----------|
| Primary        | up to 5   |
| Junior         | up to 8   |
| Senior Secondary| above 8  |
| Senior Practical|          |

Education in the primary classes is now in the home language of each pupil.

Government central (post primary) schools have been opened in each electoral division and provide a system of boarding scholarships for bright pupils.

The number of Sinhalese and Tamil schools in 1944 was —Government schools, 2,239, with an attendance of 203,516 boys and 138,562 girls; assisted schools, 3,030 (including estate schools and schools attached to places of worship) with an attendance of 206,586 boys and 173,762 girls. There were also 416 English, central and bilingual schools attended by 76,467 boys and 34,756 girls.

The total cost on education in 1943–1944 was rs. 28,067,057; in 1944–1945 rs. 34,269,643 (estimated); and in 1945–1946 will be rs. 48,863,505 (estimated).

Government scholarships tenable at universities or other recognised institutions in the United Kingdom, Europe or America, are awarded annually in educational research, art, music, and for post-graduate work in arts and science. Their value ranges from rs. 4,000 to rs. 5,000 per annum with free passages and are tenable for two or three years.
The training of teachers is conducted in state and assisted denominational colleges. These colleges are of various types.

Secondary school teachers are trained at the Government Training College, Colombo. This is the only institution at present training such teachers. The college provides a normal two-year course but in recent years a one-year course has been provided for graduates, both men and women. The number in training at present is as follows (1946):

First year . . Men 39 Women 16
Second year . . Men 22 Women 25 132.
Graduates . . Men 27 Women 3

The number of secondary-school teachers will be increased as soon as buildings become available to house the students under training.

Primary and junior-school teachers are trained in seven state schools and 16 assisted denominational schools. Some of these are co-educational institutions. The numbers of denominational schools are as follows:

Roman Catholic, 6 (3 Sinhalese and 3 Tamil).
Hindu, 3 (Tamil).
Protestant, 2 (1 Sinhalese and 1 Tamil).
Buddhist, 5 (Sinhalese).

The total number of students in training in 1946 is 1,149.

The normal course hitherto has been two years, but as the academic knowledge of the students under training has not been found to be of a sufficiently high standard, this course of training has been extended to three years from 1946. The first year is to be devoted to a study of academic subjects and an intensive course in English. The remaining two years are to be devoted to professional study and the practice of teaching.

The whole subject of the training of teachers is undergoing a complete reorganisation and expansion as the result of a recent decision by the Ceylon State Council.

Training colleges will be organised as educational centres, with practising schools under the direct control of the principal of the training college. Laboratories, playgrounds, facilities for educational research are to be provided. The educational centres will be state as well as state assisted. The assisted training colleges will have to conform to the requirements of educational centres and will be permitted to train students of the same denomination as that of the management of the training college. The number of students to be admitted to such colleges will depend on the number of teachers required for the schools under that denomination's management.

Teachers who desire admission into training colleges will in future have to enter the profession as probationers. Selection of probationers will be by means of an examination conducted by the Education Department. The period of probation will be three years, at the end of which suitable persons will be selected from the probationers for training as teachers. In this way persons who have successfully served an apprenticeship as teachers will be selected for training.

Industrial education is provided in 178 Government and grant-in-aid schools. The Ceylon Technical College provides a series of courses in engineering, commerce and arts and crafts. In 1941 the college was recognised for the London B.Sc. engineering degree. In 1944–45 session 2,090 students were enrolled.

The University of Ceylon was established on 1st July, 1942, by the incorporation of the Ceylon Medical College (founded 1870) and the Ceylon University College (founded 1921). It has faculties of oriental studies, arts, science and medicine, with power to add to their number. In 1945–46 it had 1,065 students.

MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS

There are 140 Government general hospitals providing 12,422 beds with varying accommodation from 12 beds in smaller outstations to 975 beds in the General Hospital, Colombo. These include a maternity hospital with 252 beds, an eye hospital with 96 beds, a hospital for women and children with 230 beds, a police hospital with 36 beds, an infectious diseases hospital with 168 beds, two mental hospitals and house of observation with 2,500 beds.

Besides the dispensaries attached to these hospitals, there are 271 central dispensaries, 181 branch dispensaries and 406 visiting stations in different parts of the island; 5,928,383 patients were treated at these dispensaries.

A scheme for the construction of rural hospitals has been introduced under which it is proposed to provide such hospitals in as many as possible of the areas in which central dispensaries are now functioning.

There is a Bacteriological Institute with a Pasteur Institute and Vaccine Establishment attached to it.

There are dental clinics in most of the larger towns and a travelling dental van which enables dental treatment to be carried out in the remote parts of the island.

There are special eye clinics in five of the larger towns and an ear, nose and throat clinic in Colombo.

There are, in addition, two hospitals and two sanatoria for T.B. patients with 613 beds, two hospitals for leprosy with 828 beds, a women's venereal hospital with 29 beds, and 23 clinics for the outdoor treatment of venereal disease.

Ninety-eight estate hospitals and 724 estate dispensaries (including the 99 dispensaries attached to estate hospitals) are maintained by proprietors of estates.

According to a scheme of malaria control and health work now in operation medical officers of health, placed in charge of an area comprising a population of 40,000–50,000, will carry out all health work in the area, including anti-malaria work, maternity and child welfare work, school health work, mass hookworm treatment, supervision of rural hospitals and dispensaries, holding of special clinics, control of communicable diseases, health education and propaganda, estate inspection and general sanitary work. The medical officers of health are in charge of maternity homes in their areas. The work in all these areas is being developed on health unit principles. The population assigned to a sanitary assistant or a public health nurse is 8,000–10,000, while a population assigned to a public health midwife is 4,000–5,000. These figures are not rigidly fixed and are liable to variation depending on the special conditions prevailing in any particular area. The medical officers of health are assisted by expert advice and guidance by specialist officers in charge of the divisions of anti-malaria, sanitary engineering and medical entomology.

There are 390 medical officers of health, 518 apothecaries and 489 sanitary assistants. The nursing staff consists of six European qualified matrons and sisters, 151 European Roman Catholic mothers and sisters, 25 Ceylonese sisters, 45 public health nurses, 212 matrons and nurses trained locally and 111 pupil
nurses. There is a central institution where nurses are trained. There are also 87 vaccinators, 775 midwives and several miscellaneous technical officers.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1943-44 to rs. 18,195,746. The receipts, which included the cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, etc., amounted to rs. 1,084,065 for 1943-44. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 1,497,127 for 1943-44. The export duty levied for the purpose of meeting the expense of providing medical aid to estates under the Medical Wants Ordinance, No. 9, of 1912, amounted to rs. 2,066,451 for 1943-44.

Currency and Banking

The weights and measures in common use are British.

The Currency Ordinance, No. 21, of 1941, provides for a Ceylon rupee as the unit of currency, without a coin of corresponding value, but dependent for its international value on the obligation placed on the Currency Board administering the ordinance to exchange Ceylon currency for Indian currency and vice versa. Currency notes are issued in the denominations of re. 1, rs. 2, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000, and subsidiary currency notes in the following denominations: 50, 25 and 10 cents. The following subsidiary coins were legal tender on 31st December, 1944: (1) nickel-brass, 50, 25 and 10 cents; (2) cupro-nickel and nickel-brass, 5 cents; (3) copper and bronze 1 cent and copper ½ cent. The note circulation stood at rs. 294,220,090 on 31st December, 1944, and the estimated liability of the Currency Board in respect of the circulation of subsidiary notes and coin at rs. 14,009,172/25 on the same day. The exchange rate between Ceylon and the United Kingdom is subject to fluctuation within narrow limits; it has remained close to 1s. 6d. per rupee throughout 1944.

The following banks have establishments in the island: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Imperial Bank of India; National Bank of India, Limited; Eastern Bank, Limited; Grindlay & Co., Ltd.; The Bank of Ceylon; The Bank of Uva, Limited; The Oriental Bank of Malaya, Ltd.; The Hatton Bank, Ltd.; and the Exchange Bank of India & Africa, Ltd., are the only indigenous banks in Ceylon. None of these issues notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885. On 31st December, 1944, the deposits were: Ceylon Savings Bank, rs. 36,316,225; Post Office savings banks, rs. 35,479,501.

The Colombo Harbour

The Colombo Port Commission was established in 1913 as an advisory body. The Commission is composed of eight official members and 10 unofficial members. The official members are the Chairman, Colombo Port Commission; the Deputy Chairman; the Principal Collector of Customs; the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services; the General Manager of Railways; the Mayor of Colombo; the Master Attendant, Colombo and Galle; and the Harbour Engineer. Six of the unofficial members are appointed to represent import, export, shipping, coal, oil and landing agencies' interests, and the remaining four are nominated by the Governor to represent Ceylonese interests.

The harbour works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, completed in 1885 at a total cost of £658,457, is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction north by east. It is built of concrete blocks each weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.

The North-East and Island breakwaters were completed in 1906 at a total cost of £531,657. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging.

The Island breakwater is a detached work, 2,670 feet in length, running between the two shore breakwaters, leaving a western entrance of 750 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 643 acres, or approximately one square mile.

An extension of the South-West breakwater, starting from a point 3,150 feet from the shore end, was commenced in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1912. The arm is 1,800 feet long, and runs in a direction almost due north, protecting the present main entrance from the south-west monsoon seas. The cost of this additional arm was £338,931.

The Graving Dock.—A graving dock was completed in 1906. It is 717½ feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost was £520,189. There is also a guide pier, 800 feet long, to assist vessels entering the dock. The dock has its own electric light and power installation.

Inner Graving Dock.—An inner graving dock, 350 feet long, 54 feet wide, with a depth of 20 feet over sill has been constructed. This is an extension of the existing graving dock at a higher level.

The Patent Slip was opened in 1903, the cost being £44,792. It is 800 feet long, the cradle being 220 feet, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

Oil Facilities.—(i) Petroleum. The handling of petroleum in bulk is carried out by a common oil facilities scheme operated by Government. A storage depot some 92 acres in extent is situated some 4½ miles inland at Kolonnawa, on which the oil companies' storage tanks are sited, and this is connected to the discharge berths in the harbour by four pipe-lines, three of 10-inch diameter and one of 8-inch, for the bulk discharge of furnace, diesel, kerosene, benzine and gas oil. There is also a measuring tank depot situated at Bloemendhal, about three-quarters of a mile inland, from which the oil companies operating in the bunkering trade have their own pipe lines to the bunkering points in the harbour.

Alongside berths available for oil discharge or bunkering consist of:

- Graving dock guide pier, 800 feet, for 27 feet draft (outer 500 feet for 29 feet draft).
- Oil discharge jetty for vessels up to 500 feet in length and 27 feet draft.
- Outer bunkering jetty for vessels up to 500 feet in length and 29 feet draft.
- The inner bunkering jetty is reserved for oil barge traffic.

Both Kolonnawa and Bloemendhal depots are equipped with fire protection schemes and the common facilities pumping plant is capable of handling 250 to 300 tons of oil per hour through any of the pipe lines.

The capital expenditure on the oil scheme up to 30th September, 1938, was rs. 6,054,680.

Proposals for the construction of an oil dock and for additional quays to provide alongside berths
are well advanced but construction is held up owing to the revision of original plans to meet conditions and developments since the war and after.

(ii) Coconut oil. A common facilities scheme for the shipment of coconut oil in bulk at the port of Colombo was inaugurated on 4th February, 1946. These facilities consist of storage accommodation for 1,800 tons. The installations are situated on the harbour foreshore and oil is pumped from the storage tanks to vessels through an 8-inch pipe-line to the jetty and from there by a 6-inch floating pipe-line.

The Coal ing Depot consists of 11 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 11 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, stacking and shipping of coal.

The total cost of the reclamation, jetties and quays amounts to £216,124.

The total capital expenditure on works carried out to the Colombo harbour up to the end of 1942 was rs. 61,765,302, or £4,117,687.

Since the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the port, many improvements have been carried out, and shore facilities much increased. The warehouse accommodation in 1913 was 291,600 sq. feet, and this has been increased to 581,915 sq. feet; similarly the quayage for lighters has been increased from 4,645 lineal feet to 19,709 lineal feet, including 15 coaling jetties and 3,105 lineal feet at the Lake to Harbour Canal Quays.

Dredging for deepening the harbour has been steadily carried out, and, of the 643 acres low water area of the harbour, 250 acres are now dredged to 36 feet and over, 171 acres to between 36 and 33 feet, 68 acres to between 33 and 30 feet, and the remaining 154 acres have a depth less than 30 feet; berthing accommodation, exclusive of the graving dock guide pier and oil jetties, being available for 39 vessels in the north-east monsoon and for 32 vessels in the south-west monsoon and 10 more half berths during the south-west monsoon. Eleven of these berths are available for vessels of draughts up to 33 feet during the north-east monsoon and seven during the south-west monsoon.

Harbour Tugs.—Four large Government tugs, the Hercules, Sinhabahu, Goliath and Samson, are provided for the berthing of vessels in the harbour and rendering assistance to vessels in close proximity to the port. The Hercules and Sinhabahu are ocean-going tugs and are fitted with salvage appliances and are of 2,000 horse-power, and they are available for rendering assistance within a larger radius.

Ambulance Facilities.—An ambulance launch is available for the conveyance of sick and injured persons between ship and shore. The Colombo Municipal Council provides an adequate and efficient motor ambulance service for the port.

Cranage Facilities.—The port is equipped with 60-ton floating cranes and 30-ton dockside cranes and numerous cargo cranes from 10-ton onwards.

COLOMBO WATER SUPPLY

The Colombo water supply is obtained from Labugama Reservoir which is situated in the Western Province, at a distance of 28½ miles from the city.

The reservoir was formed by impounding the water of the Wak-Oya, a tributary of the Kelani Ganga.

The catchment area, which is 2,500 acres in extent, is free from any habitation or cultivation, all the land as far as the summit of the water shed having been reserved, together with a strip two chains in depth along the adjacent water sheds.

The area of the reservoir at the present top water level is 205 acres. This lake, the scenery of which is very charming, is 373 feet above sea level and has a maximum depth of 72 feet.

The storage capacity of the reservoir is 1,960 million gallons.

Filtration works of the "Jewell Gravity" type are situated immediately below the reservoir dam.

The water has a very low alkalinity and is remarkably pure. It is conveyed to the two service reservoirs in Colombo through three separate pipe lines; two of these are of cast iron each 20 inches in diameter, and the other of steel 30 inches in diameter.

The 20-inch supply main was duplicated between Wellampitiya and Elie House reservoir (a distance of four miles) during the latter part of 1930.

The 30-inch supply main was duplicated between Wellampitiya and Maligakanda reservoir (a distance of two miles) during 1932. It was further extended for a distance of 20½ miles towards Labugama during 1933-39.

There are some 328 miles of supply and distribution mains, varying in size from 30 to three inches in diameter. Water service is available to all premises within the city and also to shipping in Colombo harbour.

A new 20-inch diameter main was laid during 1935 direct from Maligakanda reservoir to the South-West breakwater to meet the increased demand for the supply of water for shipping calling at the port of Colombo.

In addition to filtration the water is sterilised by the chloramine treatment.

Seventy-three Deacon meters for the detection of waste have been fixed throughout the city.

The average daily consumption is now between 15 and 16 million gallons, or 46 gallons per head of resident population.

COMMUNICATIONS

Railways

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:—

Broad Gauge (5 feet 6 inches). Main Line.—Colombo to Badulla (181½ miles), Kolonnawa Oil Branch and Harbour Branch (2½ miles), Ragama to Mahara (1¾ miles), Ragama to Bangadeniya (47½ miles), Peradeniya to Matale (21¾ miles). Northern Line.—Polgahawela to Kankesanturai (211½ miles), Madawachchi to Talaimannar Pier (65½ miles). Eastern Line.—Maho to Trincomalee (98½ miles), Galoya to Batticaloa (77½ miles). Coast Line.—Colombo to Matara (98½ miles).

Narrow Gauge (2 feet 6 inches).—Colombo to Opanaike (86½ miles), Nanu Oya to Ragalla (19¾ miles).

Total mileage 910½ miles.

The total cost of construction up to 30th September, 1944, was rs. 218,169,753. The receipts for the 12 months ended 30th September, 1944, were rs. 52,010,771, and expenditure rs. 32,218,329. Gain rs. 19,792,442.

The metre-gauge railway systems of India and the broad-gauge of Ceylon are within 20 miles of each other. This intervening distance is covered
by steamers of the South Indian Railway Co., which ply between Dhanuskodi (the Indian port) and Talaimannar (the Ceylon port).

Roads

Ceylon is well provided with roads. The total mileage of roads and cart tracks amounts to approximately 16,600, and that of bridle paths to over 8,200, the administration and control of this road system vesting generally in the following authorities:

| Authority                        | Mileage |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| Public Works Department          | 6,355   |
| District Road Committees         | 3,000   |
| Local Governing Authorities      |         |
| (municipalities, urban councils, etc.) | 565     |
| Village Committees               |         |
| Private Parties, Irrigation Department, etc. | 420     |

Over 7,000 miles are suitable for motor vehicular traffic, nearly 5,000 being metalled or track-metalled and the remainder being gravelled.

Most of the metalled roads are maintained in good order and with but few exceptions may be considered passable for all classes of traffic. Gravelled roads can be considered as dry weather roads only. In dry weather they are generally in fair order, but they cannot be relied upon to the extent of metalled roads.

The Public Works Department is the central road authority of the island and is in charge of the "main roads" totalling, in 1945, 6,355 miles. Practically all the roads are metalled or track metalled. About 500 miles are gravelled, and 146 miles are natural tracks. Of the metalled roads, 4,600 miles, approximately, are either grouted or surface treated with tar, bitumen or other preparations. The whole cost of maintenance of the main roads is met by the Central Government, while assistance is also rendered to the other road authorities in the form of grants-in-aid. In 1943 the expenditure incurred by the Central Government on road maintenance (including grants-in-aid) amounted to Rs. 4,728,955, the average cost of maintenance per mile for the Public Works Department roads working out at Rs. 772.

Telephones

The Government telephone system comprises three automatic exchanges at Colombo, viz., Central Exchange (3,042* subscribers, capacity 3,500), Maradana (870 subscribers, capacity 900), and Havelock Town Exchange (784 subscribers, capacity 800), in trunk communication with exchanges at Kandy (231 subscribers), Nuwara Eliya (160 subscribers), Galle (138 subscribers) and 299 smaller exchanges and call offices. There are, in addition, 92 licensed private systems of various sizes, several of which are connected by means of junction lines and subsidiary trunks with one another and the main trunk lines. The mileage of telephone wire in the Government system at the end of 1945 was estimated at 26,970 (aerial) and 45,307 (underground).

Telegraphs

Nearly all parts of the island are served by the Government telegraph system, which has 352 offices working, inclusive of railway offices open for postal telegrams. The system comprises 4,646† miles of line and 8,930 miles of wire. Ceylon is in direct telegraphic communication with India by a cable which starts from Talaimannar and crosses the Pamban Channel. It is also connected with Europe by direct cables of Cable and Wireless Limited from Colombo to Aden and with the Far East and Australia by direct cables to Penang. A cable to Seychelles connects the colony with the African Continent.

The maximum word rates to Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are:

- Full rate 85 cts., CDE 57 cts. (5 words minimum), deferred 45 cts. (5 words minimum), letter telegrams 30 cts. (25 words minimum), Empire social telegrams 30 cts. (12 words minimum).

There is a Government radio station in Colombo which is open always. This station keeps watch on 600 metres almost continuously, and on 2,100 and 36 metres according to schedules.

The normal day range is 800 miles on the 600 metres wavelength. Ships fitted with shortwave equipment are worked all along the route between the United Kingdom and the Far East and Australia.

A wireless broadcasting service is provided on wavelengths of 428 5 metres. Music, general news, market prices, etc., are broadcast for about 10 hours daily.

The station caters for over 12,000 listeners in Ceylon.

† Mileage of trunk and junction lines is included in this figure.

Rates of Postage

| Letters. | Post Cards. | Printed Matter. | Registered Newspapers. | Samples. | Registration Fee. |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------|------------------|
| Within the island and to India. | Per 2 oz. 6 cents. | Each 3 cents. | Per 2 oz. 2 cents | 2 cents for every copy not exceeding 8 oz., 2 cents for every additional 8 oz. | — 15 cents |

The rate of postage on periodicals registered as newspapers in the United Kingdom or a British colony other than Ceylon, when posted in Ceylon for transmission by inland post, is 6 cents for 6 oz., with 3 cents for each additional 6 oz., up to a maximum of 2 lb.
Air Services

To most foreign countries a "surcharge" air mail service is available at varying rates of postage. A special air letter service is also available to almost all the British Empire countries. Full information as regards rates, etc., is furnished at any post office on application.

Trade and Customs

The customs tariff of Ceylon is partly on a specific and partly on an ad valorem basis and includes provision for Empire preference. Preference has been granted, since 1st February, 1933, to certain goods produced or manufactured in and consigned from any part of the British Empire.

The basic rate of duty is 15 per cent. ad valorem. There are also lower rates of 2½ per cent., 5 per cent. and 10 per cent. and higher rates of 30 per cent. and 40 per cent., whilst in the case of a certain number of articles a specific duty is charged. A number of articles are admitted free. In the case of goods to which preference is accorded, the general rate in many cases has been fixed at 25 per cent., the preferential rate being 15 per cent. In a number of cases the general rate is 40 per cent. and the preferential rate is 30 per cent.

Distribution of Trade

Imports.—During the year 1944, 7·03 per cent. of Ceylon's imports came from the United Kingdom, 68·53 per cent. from British possessions and 24·44 per cent. from foreign countries.

The principal countries from which Ceylon's imports were obtained and the percentage supplied by each are shown below:
