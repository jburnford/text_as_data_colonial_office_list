THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.
(See Map, page 28).

Situation and Area.
The Leeward Islands form the most northerly group of the lesser Antilles. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland, (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), and France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin). The English Leeward Islands (except Sombrero, see page 295), comprising the Colonies of Antigua, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 704 square miles, and its population about 120,000.

History.
The Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1498, and became British during the 17th century.

Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, as of historical interest that the Leeward Islands possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 and 4, Will. IV., c. 74.

The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed, a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1832 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 30 inches; the other islands average twice as much. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler, but more subject to hurricanes. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December. Dominica is the hottest and least healthy of the group.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 15 of 1882, the Legislative Council now consists of ten elective and ten nominated members. Four elective members are chosen by the elective members of the Island Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, and four by the non-official members of that of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The nominated members appointed by the Queen are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the President of St. Kitts and Nevis, with five unofficial members, one from each of the island councils, and another member of one of them who acts as President.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, and the law relating to status and procedure in the maintenance of a general police and convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, questions of currency, audit and weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets once a year, at a place notified by proclamation (usually at St. John, Antigua), and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts from two to four weeks.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies, Antigua bearing five-sixteenths, Dominica three-sixteenths, Montserrat one-sixteenth, St. Kitts and Nevis three-eighths, and the Virgin Islands one-sixteenth.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the Queen's pleasure, and the Queen has power at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from both Councils.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. In addition to these, the gold doubloons are legal tender. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£4,000), St. Kitt's (£17,000), and Dominica (£8,500), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender. Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies except the Virgin Islands.

Means of Communication.

Mail communication exists between England and the Southern Islands, including Trinidad, and with the Northern Islands and Jamaica, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the same islands, as far as Trinidad, and to the United States of America, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. There is now no steamer belonging to the Federal Government.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia and Martinique, and two St. Kitt's with Antigua and St. Thomas; Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable station to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and...
St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

Postage.

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union (to England 4d. per ½ oz.). Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, the rates being 1d. the ½ oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 10,000; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 7,000; and Roseau (Dominica), 4,500.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

In Antigua there is a Yeomanry Cavalry Corps consisting of 48 officers and men, and small Artillery Corps. In St. Kitts there was until 1888 a Horse Artillery Corps, and two troops of Cavalry, the strength of the former being 26 men, and of the latter 56, officers included.

There are numerous old forts, mostly dismantled and in ruins, situated round the coasts of the several islands.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans, and Roman Catholics. The schools established by these denominations receive grants in aid from the local revenues of each Presidency. School fees are charged, and the schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants in aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools.

There are about 120 aided schools, attended by 9,000 children. Grants of 200l. each per annum are also made to grammar schools established in St. Kitts and Antigua. There is no provision for technical education.

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles.

The islands of Barbuda and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62 square miles.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1682. In 1683, Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists.
After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, and Treasurer, are *ex officio* members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1845, and are as follows:

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of 11l., or one acre of land and building value 222l., or tenancy paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 208 voters registered for the whole island, 130 are registered for the City of St. John.

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years. The elected members of the Legislative Council of Antigua send four elected members to the General Legislature.

The chief productions are sugar and pine-apples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruinous in the hands of the old planting families. There are 102 estates in cultivation, comprising 20,000 acres. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 10,000, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1874, 43 vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 1,048, chiefly engaged in coasting trade. The other towns are Falmouth and Parham.

**Import Duties.**

(Ordinances 19 of 1871, 7 of 1884, and 14 of 1885.)

By Ordinance 7 of 1884 an addition of 12½ per cent. is made to all the following duties.

MONTserrat.

This island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°43' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 47 square miles. The population of Plymouth is 1,400. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1887, three vessels, of a total tonnage of 98.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants: it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1762, but was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. After undergoing various modifications they became merged in a Legislative Assembly, which lasted down to 1867.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. Her Majesty may from time to time appoint such persons, not exceeding six in all, as she may think fit, to be respectively official, or ex officio and unofficial members of the said Council, every councillor holding office during Her Majesty's pleasure.

The principal export of the island is sugar, which is shipped in tierces and barrels: 3 tierces equal 2 hogsheads. In a very good year the crop yields 2,500 hogsheads. Many sugar works are furnished with steam engines, but there are still some fine properties which rely on the windmill: there are a few cattle mills, and two or three mills are worked by water power.

Within the last twenty years there has been established a valuable staple export, viz., lime juice, raw and concentrated. There are (principally in the northern part of the island) about 1,000 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is extending. It is principally in the hands of the Montserrat Company, Limited.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamized, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

The island is considered to be the most healthy of the Antilles.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

The Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis, and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population is about 45,000, and the total area about 153 square miles.

Constitution.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, a member appointed by him, presides, and the President enjoys an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor sees fit.

Industry.

The main industry of the two larger islands is the production of sugar, molasses, and rum. Arrowroot, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco are also grown in small quantities. Cattle are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla. The sugar crop of 1887 amounted to 20,744 hogsheads for St. Kitts and Nevis.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital. Basseterre, population about 7,000, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1887, 44 vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 817.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The temperature is from 78° to 85°.

The rainfall for the year 1887 was 47-59 inches.

The island was at one time divided between France and England, but the French were expelled in the last century.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1886, one vessel registered, with a tonnage of 136.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and
simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at £50L, and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,500, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock, which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, licences, &c.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to westward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1866.

The British Islands (about 32 in number) include Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost Van Dyke, Tortola, Peter's Island, Salt Island, and all others not now actually in possession of Denmark, with the exception of Bieques, or Crab Island which is Spanish. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. Sombrero is British, but is not included in the Colony. (See page 295.)

The Danes possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government, and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1778.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government, who is to preside at the meetings of the Council, and to have a casting as well as a deliberation vote.

There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Roadtown, Tortola, population 400, which is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1867, 18 vessels, of a total tonnage of 798.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and during the American Civil War the landed proprietors planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly. The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise a few cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their whole trade and intercourse is with the Danish Islands. The currency consists almost entirely of Mexican dollars, and Danish silver and copper, which are not legal tender. There is also a curious local currency of old Spanish dollars roughly cut into halves, quarters, and eighths, stamped with the word "Tortola." A small number of French copper coins of Louis XVI are also current under the name of "Dogs," value three farthings each.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property.

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great.

The mail communication is by small sailing craft to St. Thomas, which is touched at fortnightly by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's steamers.

DOMINICA.
Dominica is situated between 15° 20' and 15° 45' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad; very mountainous and picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, and has an area of 291 square miles.

This island was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that
the original proprietors, the Cariba, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £12,092. 11s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising, also Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771 the island was constituted a separate Government.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's.

Sugar, cocoa, and lime-juice are the chief products, but some fruit, coffee, spice, oils and timber are also exported from the island. It abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish, and there is abundance of game.

The chief town is Roseau, population about 4,500; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1887, eight vessels, of a total tonnage of 141. These are mostly engaged in coasting trade.

The Local Government is administered by a President, aided by an Executive Council of seven members. In 1865 the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The president presides over the deliberations of this body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committees.

Electors for a parish must possess land or houses to be rented at £1 per annum, or be an occupier of premises worth £1 per annum, or have an income of £25, or pay taxes of £15 per annum.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois.
