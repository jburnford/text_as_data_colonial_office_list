Prince Edward Island.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long. Its area is about 1,380,000 acres; it is about 140 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1770.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, &c.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The revenue and expenditure of the island are on an average about $250,000 a year each; and there is no direct taxation, with the exception of statute labour on the roads, or commutation money therefor, in the country, and municipal rates in the towns. The chief towns are Charlottetown (13,000), and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 208 miles in length, including branches.
Constitution.

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, a Legislative Council of 13 members, and a House of Assembly of 30 members. Both these bodies are elected.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives and four councillors to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and six in the House of Commons.

Education.

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a Chief Superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 437 schools, with 22,800 scholars, with an average attendance of 12,325, and the total cost of education in 1887 was $146,778.46. There are three higher colleges.

Finance.

Receipts and expenditure average about $250,000 each annually. The Province has no debt, but has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest.

THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North Western Territory, are, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North West Territories, were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. This Act was amended and consolidated by 43 Vic., cap. 25. The territories are governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, subject to instructions given by Order in Council at Ottawa, or by the Secretary of State of Canada.

In June, 1888, the whole territories were divided into electoral districts, returning 22 members to the "Legislative Assembly." The Assembly elects its own speaker. Three of the Supreme Court Judges are members of the Assembly without votes. From 1881 to 1888 the Lieut.-Governor had been assisted by a "Council." Since 1881 the territories have rapidly grown in wealth and importance, and of recent years emigration has been largely on the increase.

Elementary education is provided for by a Board of Education, empowered by the School Ordinance, 1887. School districts can be organised in areas not exceeding 25 sq. miles, where there are at least four heads of families, and a population of at least ten children of school age. School districts are administered by three trustees elected by the residents. Liberal aids are given to school districts on behalf of (1) Teachers' certificates, according to their grade; (2) average attendance of pupils; (3) results of an annual inspection of the school; (4) additional teachers employed in large schools. The number of public schools in operation is 101 Protestant, with 2,665 pupils and 110 teachers; 22 Roman Catholic, with 579 pupils and 28 teachers; besides 5 public or undenominational schools, with 108 pupils and 5 teachers.

The Territories were divided in 1882 into four provisional districts; viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. Regina (the capital) is in the district of Assiniboia, and has a population of 2,000. The boundaries of these districts are as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52, on the west by longitude 110, and on the south by latitude 49.

Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 110.

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by British Columbia.

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 110 and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to the Territories also. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Alberta than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that the Territories have over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.

In March, 1885, an outbreak occurred among the half-breeds in the North Saskatchewan district under the leadership of Louis Riel, who organised the Red River rebellion in 1870. The alleged grievances were the delay in granting titles to land, and the system of survey that had been adopted. A commission had been appointed in the previous January to inquire into the matter, and it was about to commence its work when the rising took place. A few hundreds of the half-breeds joined Riel, but he could only induce a small number of the Indians to help him. The remainder were thoroughly loyal. Troops consisting of the volunteer militia of the various provinces were despatched under the command of Major-General Middleton, within a few days of the skirmish between the North-West Mounted Police and the rebels at Duck Lake on March 16 becoming known, and they were conveyed by the Canadian Pacific Railway to Qu'Appelle, within 200 miles of the affected district, in about a week. General Middleton at once commenced his march to the North Saskatchewan River with the main body of his command, and despatched also a force under Colonel Otter to relieve Battleford, where Indian troubles were expected. The first engagement was at Fish Creek on April 24. Colonel Otter also attacked the Cree Indians under Chief Poundmaker on May 2. The subsequent encounters at Batoche, on May 9 and 11, ended the rebellion. Riel was taken prisoner on May 15, tried at Regina in July, and was sentenced to death. After unsuccessful appeals to the Court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba, and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, he was executed on November 16. Several Indians were hanged at Battleford, after having been tried and sentenced for murders committed during the rising. The gallantry displayed by the Canadian Militia was spoken of in terms of praise by the general in command, and a medal was issued to those who took part in the expedition.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idatywa Reserve, and Noman's Land were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Waiwich Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the colony by proclamation dated 7th Aug., 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tamboekieland, Bomvanaland, and Gocalekaland, of which by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. By Proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 8 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayilif") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of —October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Bastuoland, now an independent colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the "Haarlem," was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in
