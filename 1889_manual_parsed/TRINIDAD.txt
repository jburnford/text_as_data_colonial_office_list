TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.
The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 30' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° of W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The Colony now includes Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was to be amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.
Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.

Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in
Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the great preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercrombie, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of the colony is composed of English, French, Spanish, and a large proportion of East Indian immigrants. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

General Description.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical produce, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. Coffee has of late been largely cultivated, and with great success, bidding fair to become a very considerable factor in the future exporting power of the Colony. Tobacco of a superior quality is also largely grown. Molasses, rum, bitters, cocoanuts, and asphalt, are also exported.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about a million sterling annually, and re-shipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the past 25 years has been 65-49 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1887 was 77°4 Fahr., the mean maximum being 85°9, and the mean minimum 69°6.

The chief town and principal port of Trinidad is Port of Spain (population in 1881, 31,888), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the northeast angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 92 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,672. The harbour is the best in the West Indies.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1881, 6,335), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

Both these towns possess elective municipal councils and mayors. The municipal revenue of Port of Spain was in 1887 £18,849, and the expenditure £16,399. That of San Fernando was £4,835, and £5,251, respectively. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

There is no municipal debt.

A pitch lake, 109 to 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value, and yields a slight but increasing revenue to the island.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,123,000 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of 1887 was 379,586 acres.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers, which ply three times a week, and by the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Princes Town in 1884. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande, and a short line at Chaguana, used chiefly for the conveyance of sugar. The total length of line open is 54½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total cost of the railways has been £602,352.; the receipts during 1887 were £53,949., and the expenditure £8,2154. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund, which in 1887 was £4,4884.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and 40 out offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, and thence, via the United States, with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 68 miles, constructed by the Government at a total cost of £3,150l. The receipts in 1887 were £450l., and the expenses £909c., the total number of messages sent being 11,502.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad has within the last few years increased considerably, the number per month being now 35, viz., 4 royal mail steamers, 2 royal mail cargo steamers, 4 of the steamers of the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 4 of the West India and Pacific Line, one of the Harrison Line, and 2 of Joseph Holtz's Line, from Liverpool; 4 of the London Direct Line steamers, 1 Clyde steamer, 2 of the Quebec and Gulf Line, and 2 of the Atlantic and West India Line from America, 2 Dutch line, and 7 steamers running between the island and Venezuela. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers.

The rates of postage are as follows per ½ oz. letter:

| Distance                  | Rate |
|---------------------------|------|
| Within Colony             | 1    |
| Beyond 300 miles (except Venezuela) | 2½   |
| Beyond 300 miles (and Venezuela) | 4    |

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £15,103l., was expended by the Government in 1887, i.e., three tenths of the total expenditure, exclusive of the fixed establishment of the department, the cost of which is about £8,552l. The number of Indian immigrants during each of the last three years was as follows:

| Year | Number |
|------|--------|
| 1885 | 1,706  |
| 1886 | 2,185  |
| 1887 | 2,179  |
Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British silver and bronze, United States gold currency, and gold doubloons. These are all legal tender, as is also British gold, which is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of £180,000. There is no Colonial coinage or note issue.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank has branches at Port of Spain and San Fernando. Government savings banks are established in ten districts. The balance in these banks at the end of 1887 was £110,279. They are under the management of the Receiver-General and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879. It now numbers 235 members. There is also a Rifle Association. The Police Force of the island consists of 435 men.

Education.

Education has made considerable progress in Trinidad for some years past. The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, aided only by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, the College of the Immaculate Conception. Attached to these institutions are three exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £150 each, tenable for three years at some university in Great Britain or Ireland. There were at the end of 1887 64 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and 229 on those of the College of the Immaculate Conception.

From the Government primary schools to the Queen's Royal College there are annually open to competition three free admissions, each tenable for three years.

The primary schools are now 129 in number, 61 of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and 68 denominational and assisted. The Government schools are generally well supplied with school requisites; their furniture is constructed on good models, and some of them are held in creditable buildings. Fees are exacted, the usual rates being threepence per head per week; at some schools the charge is two shillings per month, and at the Model Schools five shillings per month. There is a reduction when the fees are paid quarterly in advance, and reduced rates are charged for the second and third children in a family. In connection with the Model Schools there are Training Colleges for male and female teachers, which admit twelve resident and seven non-resident students. The staff of the Government schools includes 57 masters, 15 mistresses, 15 assistant masters, 77 assistant and work mistresses, and 85 pupil teachers, paid monitors, and normal students.

The number of pupils attending the primary schools was as follows:

| Year | Government Schools | Assisted Schools | Total |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1884 | 3,904             | 5,182           | 9,086 |
| 1885 | 4,911             | 5,511           | 10,422|
| 1886 | 4,212             | 6,315           | 10,527|
| 1887 | 6,277             | 7,299           | 13,576|

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private adventure schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. Under the Presbyterian Coolie Mission there are 15 estate schools, having about 583 pupils; so that it may be roughly estimated that the number of children attending school in Trinidad is about 15,000.

Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an executive council of three members. The legislative body is Council, including the Governor who is President, 6 official, and 8 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.
