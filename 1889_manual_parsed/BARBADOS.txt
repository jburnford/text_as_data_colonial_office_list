BARBADOS.

Situation and Area.

Barbados is situated in latitude 18° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Carribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 English miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains a superficial area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles.

History.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship "Olive" in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the leeward side of the island formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Carribbee Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour, and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he
remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived at Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The leeward and windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth, he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners: it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

General Description.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 18° 5' 42" North, and longitude 8° 58' 29" West. This town contains, according to the census of 1881, 20,947 inhabitants. The estimated population now is 25,000; Speightstown, the only other town, has 1,600 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1886, 36 vessels, of a total tonnage of 6,331 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

Industry.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. It is stated that, in 1663, there were 358 sugar-works in operation. At the present time they number over 500. The produce of 1871 amounted to 53,800 hogsheads of sugar and 33,500 puncheons of molasses; in 1876, 37,848 hogsheads of sugar, and 24,001 puncheons of molasses. In 1887 the produce amounted to 63,872 hogsheads of sugar and 44,289 puncheons of molasses.

Population.

The population of the island in 1861 amounted to 185,989; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 showed a total of 152,727 inhabitants. By the census of 1871 there were 162,042 inhabitants, of whom 16,560 were white, and the remainder coloured and black; the natural increase having been checked by the migration to other West Indian Islands of large numbers of the labouring population. By the census of 1881 the population is returned at 171,860. It is now estimated at 180,000. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in sterling, and British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is but little gold in circulation. The only bank doing business in Barbados is the Colonial Bank, capital paid up £60,000L sterling. Total number of branches throughout West Indies 18, total amount of deposits £1,689,918L. (31st Dec., 1887), total amount of note circulation (five dollar notes) £457,958L. In Barbados, estimated circulation £36,000L. There is a Government savings bank, which had on 31st December, 1887, 7,768 depositors, and deposits amounting to £79,946L.

Internal Communication.

A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of Saint Andrew (28 miles as surveyed) was commenced in 1880, and completed on 10th September, 1882. The total cost of construction was 200,000L.; the receipts for the year ended 31st March, 1888, were 8,845L., and the expenses 13,771L. It belongs to the Barbados Railway Company, Limited.

There is telephonic communication between the police stations by 85 miles of line, which cost 1,465L., and is open to public use.

Mail Service, Postage, &c.

The Royal Mail steamers arrive in and leave Barbados every alternate week from and to England. There is also fortnightly communication with all the West Indies by these steamers.

Besides the Royal Mail, a steamer of the West Indian and Pacific, or the Harrison Line, arrives every week from Liverpool.

The direct line from London arrives monthly.

The Quebec line of steamers arrive fortnightly from the United States. The fortnightly steamer from New York to Brazil also touches, both going and returning.

There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados, and direct cable communication with St. Vincent, and thence to the other West Indies, America, and Europe.

Rates of Postage.

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Within the Island | per ½ oz. 1d. each ½d. |
| Postal Union west of Suez | 2½d. per 2 oz. 1d. |
| Postal Union east of Suez | 4½d. |
| Parcels to West Indies 6d. per lb., to England 8½d. per lb. |
Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Law No. 41 of the 9th December, 1878, which authorises an expenditure not exceeding £15,000 annually.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control conducted by the clergyman of the district assisted by the School Committee. There are 197 schools, with over 14,392 scholars (average attendance), and 28,252 on the rolls.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of £30 per annum from the College funds, and four Island Scholarships at £40 per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives. There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by the legislature. It has a staff of 7 university men as Masters, a Professor of Chemistry and Agricultural Science, and a Professor of German. The average number of pupils is about 150. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1882, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1887 was 87. There are four Barbados Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, each of the annual value of £75, tenable at Oxford or Cambridge for four years. Besides these scholarships there are grants in aid to the successful competitors for the Gilchrist scholarships of £50 each per annum for three years.

A first grade school for girls was opened in 1883, called the Queen's College. It has a staff of five mistresses and a music master. The number of pupils was 85 at close of 1887.

Defence.

Barbados is the headquarters of the military force in the West Indies, having an imperial garrison of 804 men. Charles Fort, on the southwest of the island, is a fortified position carrying heavy guns.

Police, &c.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1885 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police, and a Corps of Writ Officers added to the Force. A Juvenile Reformatory was opened in April, 1888.

A lunatic asylum and a lazaretto are kept up at the public expense; and there is a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the colony contributes £6,630 per annum.

Constitution.

The colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public officers. The Government consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the Queen, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected annually on the basis of a moderate franchise. The qualification of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act a liberal extension of the franchise was granted, and about 4,200 electors are registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being only 1,641. The executive part of the Government consists of the Governor, Officer commanding the troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General ex officio, and such other person as is nominated by the Queen, one member of the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly nominated by the Governor. This body is called the Executive Committee, and introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates and initiates all Government measures. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1885, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands, and made a distinct Government.
