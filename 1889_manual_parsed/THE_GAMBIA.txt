THE GAMBIA.

Situation and Area.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a-half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, and separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Settlement on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Combo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and 180 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river, the whole of the latter being British waters. The total area of the Settlement is about 69 square miles.

History.

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators, but they made no settlement.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in Exeter to trade in the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for this. It was not successful, and another established two years later also failed. In 1664 a fort was built on the island, now known as Fort James.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade (1807) till 1816, when a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary by British merchants from Senegal.

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France in the treaty of 1783, with the exception of a French factory which was subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. These two exceptional rights were exchanged in 1857.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821, till in 1843 it was created an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1827; and British Combo was granted by the King of Combo in various sessions in 1840, 1850, and 1855.

Industry.

The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton, maize, corn, palm kernels, indiarubber, cola nuts, wax, and native "pagne" or country cloths. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths called pagnes, the manufacture of vegetable oils, boat building, and some brick making, there are no manufacturing industries in the country.

A considerable entrepôt trade is done with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts, in cotton goods, spirits, rice, cola nuts, and hardware. Most of the exports go to France, but half of the imports come from England. Bathurst is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1887, 120 vessels registered, of 2,066 tons in the aggregate. The ground nut is the staple product of the Settlement. It is planted in June, and reaped in November, and largely exported to the South of Europe for the extraction of oil. The industry began in 1845, reached its climax in 1858, and has since declined, owing to the competition of other oil materials.

Relations with the Interior.

The Administrator of the Gambia exercises no jurisdiction over the population surrounding the British settlements, but friendly relations are cultivated with the native tribes. Stipends are paid and frequent presents made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the trade routes open.

In the early part of the year 1881 an expedition (The Upper Gambia Expedition), under the command of Dr. Gouldsbury, Administrator of the Gambia, set out from the settlement for the purpose of examining the upper river, with a view of ascertaining its capabilities as a highway for trade between the coast and the interior, and also with the object of reaching Timbo, the capital of the extensive Futa Jallon country, and from thence returning to the coast at Sierra Leone.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is that of the Latin Union; there is no Colonial coinage and no note issue. A Government savings bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec., 1887, 430l. deposited, but there are no private banks.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants in aid. There is one Anglican school (free), 8 Mohammedan, 3 Wesleyan, and 2 Roman Catholic, with about 1,300 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory, and fees are charged.

Means of Communication.

The Liverpool mail steamers call every fortnight, and there is also regular communication via Dakar with Bordeaux. Four telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs, or metalled roads, save one from Bathurst to Cape St. Mary across the Oyster Creek Bridge, which connects the island of St. Mary with the mainland of British Combo. Horses will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 300 miles. The postage of letters to Europe, United States, and West Africa, is 4d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is fairly healthy during the dry season. The mean temperature is 75°, the annual
range being from 63° to 94°. The rainfall is about 44 inches, the rainy season being from June to October, and the cool Harmattan from November to February.

The inhabitants are most of the negro race, the chief tribes being the Jollofs, Mandingoes, and Jolahs. There are about 25 Europeans in the colony, out of a population, in 1881, of 14,150. The town of Bathurst contains about 6,000 inhabitants.
