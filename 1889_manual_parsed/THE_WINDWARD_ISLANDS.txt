THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

(See Map, page 22.)

Situation and Area.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago has been united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British islands are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor-in-Chief, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles, and its population about 130,000.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1838 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was united to Trinidad 1st Jan., 1889.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five dollar notes to the extent of 9,800l. in St. Lucia, 11,700l. in Grenada, and 8,000l. in St. Vincent. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language is a French patois.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at most of the islands. All the islands are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cables to St. Thomas and St. Croix. There is no railway in any of them.

The Rates of Postage are:

- Letters per ½ oz.: Newspapers.
- Internal ... 1d. ... ¼d. per ¼ oz.
- Within 300 miles ... 2½d. ... ¼d. per 2 oz.
- Beyond ditto ... 4d. ... ¼d. "

GRENADA.

Situation and Area.

Grenada is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles. It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and between it and the latter island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, partly attached to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 5,154 souls.

General Description.

The country is mountainous and very picturesque, and abounds in streams and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, 7 miles from St. George, and Lake Antoine are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1887 57 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,081 tons. The town has a population of 4,000.
The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), St. Patrick (or Sauteurs), and Grenville (or La Baye). Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except 800 imported coolies.

Industry.

The island has long ceased to be a great sugar producing colony, and its main product is cocoa, but a good deal of rum is still manufactured. Spices, cocoanuts, and fruit are also grown, and live stock, poultry, vegetables, and firewood are shipped to Trinidad and Barbados. The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George with 279 depositors and 5,041l. deposited.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation.

Constitution.

There was formerly a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members, and regulated by an Act of 1834.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, in lieu of the Legislative Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a-year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieutenant-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council has been established by the Queen, consisting of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the group.

Education.

There are six Government elementary schools, and 22 aided schools. The latter are under the local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants and annual grants in aid are made by the Government on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1887 the average attendance was 2,001 children, the number on the rolls being 3,325. Fees are charged in all schools, and attendance is not compulsory. There is a grammar school partly supported from public funds, but no other provision for higher or technical education.

ST. LUCIA.

Situation and Area.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 24 miles in length, and 12 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is 150 miles, and its area 243 sq. miles. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 1,000 houses, and a population of about 6,000 souls. Next in importance is the town of Soufriere, containing a population of 2,200 souls.

History.

At the period of its discovery, St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent d'Orléans made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Ilet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms, on the 4th of April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population now amounts to 42,300. Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, except about 2,400 East Indian immigrants. The reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is undeserved. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera. Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour, probably the best in the whole of the West Indies. It is now the second naval station of the Empire in these parts, and will doubtless become of great commercial importance as a port of call when the Panama Canal is completed. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1887, 14 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 786 tons. It has been chosen as the chief coaling station for the fleet in the West Indies, and is being strongly fortified.

A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and has now 438 depositors with 8,567l. to their credit on 31st Dec., 1887.

Constitution.

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Sénéchaussée,"
and a higher Court called the "Conseil Supérieur," or Court of Appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council. The Legislature consists of the Administrator and a Council composed as the Queen may direct. Law is administered by a judge, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Windward Islands, and by three magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve as in England.

The Government grants £25l. a year each to Lady Nucos Trust and the Roman Catholics, who each maintain 11 schools, the former with 783 children, and the latter 1,104 in average attendance, and a total of 3,256 on the rolls.

A code of civil law, the authors of which are Sir G. W. Des Voeux, K.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code has been framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances.

Industry.

Sugar, cocoa, logwood, tobacco, and spices are produced. There are four sugar "Usines" with the best machinery, in one of which the Colonial Government has an interest.

Immigration from the East was resumed in April, 1878, and there is at present in the Colony an Indian population of about 2,400.

ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.
The Island of St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land, of which only about 13,000 acres is in cultivation. Some of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from the mainland.

General Description.
Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the bottom of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of 5,593 souls. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 31 vessels, of 768 tons.

St. Vincent, though exhibiting some features in common with the other islands, is favourably distinguished from many of them by an undulating surface, and a succession of gentle slopes, of which portions are cultivated for sugar-cane. Its most striking peculiarity is its "Soufrière," or volcanic mountain, celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and is about 3,000 feet above the level of the sea.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded mountain traverses it from north to south, sending off spurs on each side. The highest peak is Morne à Garou, 4,000 feet high. The streams are small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Kingston river.

Industry.
Sugar, rum, cocoa, spices, and excellent arrow-root are produced. A large proportion of the cultivated land is owned by one firm, and the negroes "squat" upon the unsurveyed and unoccupied Crown lands. The forests produce excellent woods.

History.
At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands. The Caribs continued sole masters of St. Vincent until the year 1765, when a number of savages of a different race were discovered on it. These received the appellation of "Black Caribs," to distinguish them from the aborigines, to whom the name of "Yellow Caribs" was given.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of 63,625l.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals.
By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but then the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overrun the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British head-quarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Rattan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of Coolie labourers in 1861. There are about 2,000 of these immigrants at present located on different plantations in the island.

**Constitution.**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor, and composed of three members, one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony; and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. By an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, the Legislative Council now consists of four official and four nominated unofficial members.

The several courts of the Colony were by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1890, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.

There is one Government school, 26 Anglican, 18 Wesleyan, and 3 Roman Catholic schools, with 5,023 children on the rolls, and an average attendance of 3,392. The Government expenditure on education in 1887, was £1,635l.

A savings' bank was established in 1866 and has now 791 depositors with 9,562l. deposited.
