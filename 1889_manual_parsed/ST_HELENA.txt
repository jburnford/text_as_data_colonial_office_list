ST. HELENA.

Situation and Area.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, in 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 104 miles long and 64 broad; its area is 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres. The distance from Plymouth is 4,256 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from Plymouth, 14 days, and from Capetown, 5 days.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of about 4,000. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The annual rainfall is about 30 inches. The island is very healthy, the average death-rate for the last three years having been only 15-3 per 1,000, including invalids brought to the island seriously ill.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and densely wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1501. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden, of the English Navy, in 1673, took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was finally handed over to the British Government, under an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education.

The Government maintain 4 schools, having 336 scholars. There are also 7 private day schools, not aided by Government, having 484 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordnance No. 4 of 1874, and fees are charged.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, and the entire trade therefore depends exclusively upon the intercourse and the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress. Its trade has greatly diminished in recent years in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies is steadily diminishing. In 1878, including steamers and ships of war, it was 669; in 1879, 602; in 1880, 564; in 1881, 525; in 1882, 497; in 1883, 521; and in 1884, 414; in 1885, 450; in 1886, 376; and in 1887, 318. It is a port of registry, but has now no ships.

The chief industries are fishing and agriculture, the main arable crops being barley, oats, Indian corn, and potatoes. Some New Zealand flax is also grown.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1887, 5,985l.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England alternately every 3 and 5 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence every third and fourth week, and proceed to England. Rate of postage: to England and the Cape Colony, 6d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post, but there are 104 miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 700l. The receipts in 1887 were 57l., and the expenses 228l. 4,639 messages were sent in 1887. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Madeira, Capetown, and Loanda.

Defence.

Jamestown has been made a second-class imperial coaling station, and extensive defensive works have been constructed on the heights overlooking the harbour. There is an imperial garrison of 267 men, and the cadre of an island militia still exists.
