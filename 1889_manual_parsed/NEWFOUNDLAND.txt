NEWFOUNDLAND.

(See Map, page 52.)

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 180; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles. The coast of Labrador, on the continent, is now included in the colony. It comprises about 120,000 square miles, but has only 4,211 inhabitants.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1628, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634, a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and 20 years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was ceded to Great Britain, subject to certain rights reserved to France, which are still in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo. They claim the exclusive right to fish along certain portions of the coast from Bona Vista to Cape Ray, upon which they erect temporary structures for drying the fish. The exact extent of this right is in dispute, and there are other questions at issue as to magisterial jurisdiction, mines, harbours, and river fisheries. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, and mining—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Copper is largely worked for export, and lead and silver are also found.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, salmon, herring, and lobster. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in June, and the fishery extends for over 700 miles, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. In 1874 the number of men engaged was 53,000, including the subsidiary industries, with 1,200 vessels, of about 62,000 tons, besides 18,000 boats employed in the shore fisheries. The home consumption is about 270,000 quintals, and the export in 1887 was 913,145 quintals, 30 bank cod going, on an average, to one quintal. The export is mainly to Portugal, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are derived mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Currency and Banking.

There are two banks in the Colony, the Union Bank of Newfoundland (capital £14,962), note circulation £148,962; and the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland (capital £76,500, note circulation £92,366); their aggregate deposits in 1887 amounted to £858,666. There is a Government savings bank at St. John's and Harbour Grace, with £1,860,968 deposits, and 4,030 depositors.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States gold and full weight dollars, gold doubloons, Mexican and other dollars, and Colonial coins. Much of the trade is carried on by barter. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 44 miles in length, constructed and worked by a private company. The total approximate cost of construction was £2,500,000, the receipts in 1886 being £46,721, and the expenses £46,974. A branch line constructed by the Government during the past year, connecting with Placentia, came into operation in October. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 994 miles of telegraph open, and cables start for Europe (at Heart's Content) and America (at Placentia). There is a fortnightly mail service (except from January to March) with Liverpool, Halifax, New York, Montreal, and Prince Edward Island. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| In St. John's | 1 cent. Free. |
| Within Colony | 3 " |
| Europe, United States, and South America and West Indies | 5 " 1 cent. |

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's is 36°, the extreme range being from 13° below zero to 86°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The average annual rainfall is 51 inches, evenly distributed throughout the year. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being generally spoken; but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1887. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There are 480 schools, with 25,897 scholars. The schools are denominational (except Harbour Grace Grammar School), and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, but there is no provision for technical education. The total cost of primary education in 1887 was £119,642-75.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 28,610 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 7,054; Fogo, with Twillingate, has 4,777; Bona Vista 3,463; and Carbonear 3,756 inhabitants.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council not to exceed 7 members, a Legislative Council not to exceed 15 members, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by householders, who have occupied a dwelling-house as owner or tenant for 1 year immediately preceding the day of election. There are 28,350 (exclusive of Burinada Poile) electors registered on the electoral roll, and 19 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 8 return two members, and 9 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding £500, in amount or value, or a net annual income of £100. The ordinary duration of the Session is about three months, and it generally meets in January.

Members of the Council and Assembly receive £120 each (President £240) per session, which is provided for annually in a local Act. There are no municipal institutions in the Colony.
