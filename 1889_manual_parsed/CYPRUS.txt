**Cyprus.**

**Situation and Topography.**

The island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 30' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 15' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-
east, between Cape Dropano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Messoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, and of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

**History.**

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King or formerly King of Jerusalem, and undertook the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, herself a Venetian and widow of James II, having survived her husband and his posthumous son, James III, yielded the government of the island to the Republic of Venice. Venice ruled the island until 1570-71, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was held by the Pasha of Egypt, then at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1425 to 1571, it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1373 until 1464, when the Lusignan king, James II, retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

**Climate.**

The mean temperature is 66.3°. The mean maximum for the last seven years was 100.8°, the mean minimum 31.7°; the highest temperature recorded in the period being 111°. The average rainfall in the last seven years was 16.521 in., the rainy season being from October to March. There are occasional droughts.

**Population.**

The population of the several districts at the census taken in 1881 was:—Nicosia, 56,312; Famagusta, 38,207; Larnaca, 20,766; Limassol, 29,248; Papho, 28,424; Kyrenia, 13,216. The total population was 186,178, of whom the Moslems form about one-fourth, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church. The estimated present population is 200,000. The birth rate is about 28 per thousand per annum, the death rate about 19 per thousand.

**Towns.**

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 11,536 inhabitants; Larnaca, 7,833; Limassol, 6,006. The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour; but at present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has only 658 inhabitants, nearly all Moslems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 1,906, nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, the modern capital of Papho, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, where a small harbour is now being constructed in the district of the same name, on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania.

**Industry.**

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but they have not been worked in modern times. One or two concessions have, however, been recently granted to persons desirous of renewing the mining industry. Gypsum and terra umbra are exported. The wealth of the island consists mainly in its agricultural produce, chiefly corn, cotton, carobs (locust-beans), linseed, madder, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, cheese, wool, hides, and wine. The common wines are for the most part exported to Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Trieste; but both the common and the richer wines are exported to Austria, Italy, and France, to be used in giving strength and flavour to the fruit of poor vineyards. Cyprus wine is perhaps somewhat heady for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it derives from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice is being discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables wine to be conveyed in barrels.

The agricultural prosperity of the island is greatly retarded by want of water. The rainfall is somewhat deficient in the whole, and has not been made the best use of; although it is hoped that under a measure passed in the Legislature of 1887 facilities will be found for constructing irrigation works.

Much injury to crops has also been caused in the past by locusts, but the numbers are now inconsiderable and but little damage is done. The work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit system." The screens are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march, and being topped with oilcloth, the locusts cannot get over them, and are gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which they cannot emerge, as they are topped with a zinc lining.
The island has suffered greatly from the extensive destruction of its forests, but what remains of them is recovering although slowly under the better care now bestowed upon them.

Sponge fishing is extensively carried on along the coast by boats from Kalymnos and other islands.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, alcohol, iron, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, and copper manufactures; the exports are chiefly corn, cotton, caroubs, linseed, madder, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, cheese, sumac, wood, hides, wines, and spirits.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council which came into operation on the 1st August, 1882, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign, half-sovereign, Turkish lira, and French 20-franc piece. Silver, the florin, shilling, sixpence, and three-pence, limit of tender, 3l. Bronze, the piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 3s. = 27 piastres.

There are two banks, the Imperial Ottoman and the Anglo-Egyptian, each having branches or agencies at Larnaca, Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta, Papho, and Kyrenia.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

Means of Communication.

There is no railway or navigable waterway in the island, but good roads between all important places are now maintained. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 195 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria, and a weekly mail with Smyrna and Constantinople by the "Austrian Lloyd" and "Messageries Maritimes" steamers. There are also frequent direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers |
|-----------------------------|
| Within the island | ½ c. p. | ½ c. p. per 2 oz. |
| England | " | " |

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of efficient schools was established in 1882. The total grant (£3,000) is divided into two portions, one quarter being shared among the Moslem, and three-quarters among the Christian schools. 12,000 children are at school.

No provision is made for higher or technical education.

Leprosy

Prior to the British occupation, provision was made for only seven lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was, it is stated, originally founded by a charitable Maronite lady.

The asylum has now been improved and enlarged, and accommodates 65 persons, on an enclosed farm of 200 donums, a portion of which the lepers cultivate. In addition each person receives a small Government allowance.

No leper is ever allowed to quit the farm except the village headman, who purchases every morning the daily necessaries for the community.

The census of 1881 returned 78 lepers, or about 4 per 10,000 of population, but there are probably a few more in far-outlying villages.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms, the tubercular, and the anesthetic; of the latter there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis mutilans, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers, toes, and even whole members occurs. In the other form the skin and mucous membranes are the parts chiefly affected, especially the face and head. This form is more common, more dreadful in its effects, and more rapid in its termination; but neither of the two can be called a fatal disease, as their average duration is 10-20 years, and some lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages in the districts of Famagusta, and cases among Mussulmen are of the greatest rarity. Hereditary infection can be traced in nearly every instance, while malarial taint and improper food appear to be the provoking cause; it is doubtful whether cases ever occur without these two factors. The disease is believed to be slowly decreasing.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending her Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkemé-i-Shériféh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands let or sold during that period.*

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazzi Miiriyé vé Emlaki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compul-

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £6,000 a year.
sorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers of pardon, appointment, suspension from office, &c., &c., usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal, consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to £l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkemé-i-Shéríeh, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi's, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—

   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.
   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.
   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males.

3. Tithes of the principal products of the island, assessed in money.

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of 1 per cent. on tithes and certain incomes.

9. Import duties according to the following tariff:

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. Tithes on grapes and on certain minor articles have been abolished; carobs and silk cocoons pay tithes only on exportation. An export duty of 12 per cent. is charged on raisins. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

Total Customs revenue in 1887-8, 27,075l.

There is a military police force of about 630 men, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its mediæval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriotic antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1883 by subscription.

NIGER PROTECTORATE.

The British Protectorate over the entire basin of the Lower Niger, including the Benin and Cross Rivers, was formally assumed in July, 1884, when regular treaties of protection were concluded by Consul Hewett with all the principal Chiefs. It extends along the coast of Africa from the Benin River (where it joins the boundary of Lagos) to the mouth of the Rio del Rey at 9° east longitude. Inland the Protectorate includes the whole basins of the Lower Niger and Binué up to and beyond the Boussa rapids on the former, and Jin on the latter, in about 10° north latitude. The settlement of the Baptist Missionary Society at Victoria, Amboises (or Ambas) Bay was formerly British territory, having been formally annexed in July, 1884. It was however ceded to the German Empire, which has acquired by purchase the rights of the Baptist Missionary Society, the transfer of sovereignty taking place on the 29th March, 1887.

The whole of these vast districts are under the general supervision of the British Consul for the Rights of Benin and Biafra, but on the 10th of July, 1886, a Royal Charter was granted to the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), by which extensive powers of administration were conferred upon them in the territories over which they have treaty rights, including a belt of 30 miles on each bank of the Niger and Binué. The operations of the Company extend as far inland as Gando and Sokoto, with the Sultans of which countries treaties have been concluded. The Company's operations on the sea coast are mainly confined to Akassa, the Nün entrance to the Niger. The British Consular jurisdiction is chiefly exercised in the river mouths between the Benin, Brass, and the Old Calabar Rivers.

Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, in cable communication with Lagos, and thus with Europe. Regular steamers arrive and depart from Liverpool and the South-West Coast of Africa every three weeks. Communication in the Niger Basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.

Industry.

An enormous trade, wholly in the hands of English firms, is done in the Protectorate, mainly with this country, Germany, and France. There are extensive depôts in all the river mouths of the delta, from which palm oil and kernels, with some ebony, are exported. The internal trade of the Niger and Binué is almost entirely done by the Royal Niger Company, whose chief depot is Akassa. Besides the articles already mentioned, ivory, indiarubber, shea-butter and beni-seed are exported by the Company, which has over 150 "factories."

The imports consist of cotton goods, spirits, hardware, guns, gunpowder, salt, silks, and coral. The steamers of the Company navigate the Niger up to the rapids of Boussa, 460 miles from the sea, and for 450 miles of the course of the Binué, which falls into the Niger at Igbegbe, 290 miles from the sea. No statistics as to the amount of trade are available.

Customs Tariff of the Royal Niger Company (payable at Akassa and Lokoja):

| Import Duties (Akassa) | s. d. |
|------------------------|------|
| Spirits, per imperial gallon | 2 0 |
| Tobacco, per lb. | 0 6 |
| Salt, per cwt. | 1 0 |

Export Duties (Akassa):

| Export Item | s. d. |
|-------------|------|
| Palm kernels, per cwt. | 2 0 |
| Palm oil and shea butter, per gallon | 0 1 |
| Ivory, per lb. | 1 0 |
| All other native produce, 20 per cent. ad val. |

There are no Customs duties at the other ports on the coast.

The amount of import duties levied in 1887 was £24,037l., and the export duties £16,781l.

Administration.

No interference in the domestic government of the native chiefs is contemplated, but disputes are settled and much indirect influence is exercised by the British Consuls under the general direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Civil and criminal jurisdiction over British subjects is exercised in the Consular Courts (under the West Africa Order in Council, 1885), subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone or the Gold Coast Colony. Within the territories of the Royal Niger Company civil and criminal jurisdiction is exercised by the officers of that Company under the powers given by the Charter. The judicial system was organised by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G., during 1888.

tions, and to have the right to establish Consular Officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government. The area of the State is 41,000 square miles, the population about 300,060. The revenue and expenditure in 1887 were $350,813 and $366,540. The imports were $1,259,867, and the exports $1,408,841. Practically the whole trade is with Singapore.

An agreement in similar terms has been made with the Sultan of Brunei.

SOUTH AFRICA.

High Commissioner.

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa, was created by Letters Patent in 1878, and is filled by the Officer administering the Government of the Cape Colony. The High Commissioner is charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal), and the Orange Free State, as well as those with Swaziland, Pondoland, and other native states and tribes outside the Cape Colony and Natal. In 1879, a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland, but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who is also Governor of Natal (and now of Zululand), and conducts the relations with Amatongaland. The High Commissioner for South Africa is also Governor of British Bechuana land and Basutoland, and supervises the affairs of the Bechuana land Protectorate, as well as the recent extension of British influence as far north as the Zambesi. The Administrator of British Bechuana land is also Deputy Commissioner; and in July, 1888, a Deputy Commissioner was appointed for Pondoland, who is paid by the Cape Government. The correspondence with the South African Republic is carried on through a British Agent at Pretoria furnished with a letter of credence to the President.

High Commissioner, The Right Hon. Sir H. G. R. Robinson, G.C.M.G. (Cape Town), 1,000l.

Secretary to the High Commission, Graham Bower, late Commander, R.N., 600l.

Deputy Commissioner for Bechuana land, Sir S. G. A. Shippard (Vryburg), 1,800l.

Assistant Commissioner for the Protectorate, J. S. Moffat, 600l.

Deputy Commissioner for Pondoland, J. P. Scott, 600l.

British Agent at Pretoria, Ralph Williams.

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, or New South Wales, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised power, and includes the Southern Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, the Tongan or Friendly Islands, the Samoan or Navigators' Islands, and the various small groups of Melanesia. The Protectorate established by Her Majesty's Government over part of New Guinea and adjacent islands is administered by a Special Commissioner, but for judicial purposes it remains under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner's Court for the Western Pacific.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of Her Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have jurisdiction civil and criminal analogous to that of Stipendiary Magistrates and Judges of County Courts, with certain limited powers in respect of probate and letters of administration.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of her Majesty's ships of war on the Australian station have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POSSESSIONS.

ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England, the whole area being about seventy square miles. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory, and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The imports in 1887 amounted to £1,870,607, and the exports to £1,507,718. The exports consist of coffee, dyes, feathers, gums, spices, &c. The imports from Great Britain in 1887 were £155,670, and the exports to were £337,724. The settlement is subject to the government of Bombay, being presided over by a president, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison. (For further information see publications relating to India).

PEIRIN, an island situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, is a dependency of Aden, and is administered from that port. It contains a lighthouse.

SOCOTRA, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belongs. The area of the island is about 3,000 square miles, and its population about 4,000, of Arab descent. It was formally annexed in October, 1886.

In 1887 also a Protectorate was established over the Somali coast, extending from Berbera round Cape Guardafui to Ras Hafauri.

ASCENSION.

The island of Ascension, 84 miles in area, lying in the South Atlantic, lat. 7° 53' S. and long. 14° 18' W., is under the supervision of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who maintain a small naval station there. It was taken possession of in 1815, and is now garrisoned by 100 marines. It is famous for its turtles, large numbers of which are caught between Dec. and May. The mail steamers from the Cape call there once a month. It is a barren, rocky peak of purely volcanic origin, and destitute of vegetation, except at the highest point, but has been cultivated to an extent permitting the maintenance of 3,000 sheep. The transfer of the naval station to St. Helena is under consideration. The population is about 166. The imports from and exports to the United Kingdom in 1887 were £2,818, and £78 respectively.

Captain, Richard H. Napier, R.N.

TRISTAN D'ACUNHA.

Tristan d'Acunha and Gough Island are the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. and long. 12° 2' W. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. Upon his death the garrison was withdrawn, with the exception of three men, who, with certain shipwrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement. For a long time only one of the settlers had a wife, but subsequently the others contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. The population has since increased to about a hundred, and remains practically stationary, as the younger and more ambitious settlers migrate in batches to the Cape. The inhabitants practically enjoy their possessions in common, and there is no strong drink on the island, and no crime. It was at one time proposed to give them laws and a regular government, but this was found unnecessary for the above reasons, and they remain under the moral rule of their oldest inhabitant, Governor Green, successor to Governor Glass, Corporal in the Royal Artillery, and founder of the settlement. The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885. There are 300 cattle and 200 sheep on the islands, and crops of potatoes are raised.

MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS.

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island (Tasmania), Sydney Island, the Caroline and Flint Islands (Pacific Ocean), Malden Island (off the coast of Victoria), the Purdy Group (New Guinea), Sombrero (West Indies, with a Board of Trade Lighthouse costing £20 annually), Cato Island, Raine Island, Bell Cay, Bramble Cay, Pilgrim Island, Ducie Island, Bauman Island, Roggewein Island, Teinhoven Island, Coral Island and Dudosa, Suwarro Island, Starbuck Island, Little Scrub Island, Palmerston Island, Surprise Island, Vostoc, Willis's Islets (all in the Pacific Ocean), and there are many others. Most of these have no permanent inhabitants but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection. The rents are paid into the Exchequer. Christmas, Fanning, and Penrhyn Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, were formally annexed in 1888, as lying in the path of a possible telegraph cable connecting Canada and Anstralasia.

Another Christmas Island, 200 miles south of the western end of Java, entirely uninhabited, was annexed in July 1888, in view of a project for a duplicate cable to Australia.

In November, 1888, a Protectorate was established over the Hervey or Cook Islands, the principal of which is Rarotonga, the inhabitants of which had frequently asked for British protection.

The Mushahh Islands, a group of coral reefs on the coast of Abyssinia, were ceded by the Sultan of Tejurch, and taken possession of on the 31st August, 1840. By agreement with France in July, 1887, they were recognised as being under French protection, and they now belong to the French Colony of Joboek.

The Kuriyan-Muriyan Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable. On one of them, Hallaniyah, is the signalling station maintained by the Telegraph Company. The whole group is leased for the purpose of guano collection.
