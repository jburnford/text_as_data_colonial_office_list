Straits Settlements.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict. c. 115.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island about 27 miles long by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 16' north, and long. 103° 53' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (cf. infra), the whole containing an area of 270 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, including the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, is in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed, by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles W.S. of Batavia.

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent state from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been
taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bengoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should not again meddle, with the affairs of or have any settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined, and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not reduced to mercantile subjection by the Dutch; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn declined in importance, as the greater part of the extensive Eastern trade centred at Singapore, and Penang came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon; and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Province Wellesley. It extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 270 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation when compared with the neighbouring territories, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and cocoa-nuts. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1831 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore. Singapore Island was taken by the King of Java in 1252, but was abandoned in the 14th century. It remained independent and scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Malayan princes. It was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1828 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Native States.

The anarchy prevailing in some states of the Malayan Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was for years a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders. In the beginning of 1874, under the instructions of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir A. Clarke to remedy this state of things by stationing British residents in Perak and Selangor, and in the small state of Sungai Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration. With a view also of enabling the British Authorities to keep order in that part of the Peninsula, a strip of land south of Province Wellesley, about 10 miles broad, beyond the Krian river, has been acquired as British Territory, as well as the territory known as The Dindings, consisting of the island of Pulau Pankor and a small portion of the mainland opposite.

Towards the end of 1875 disturbances arose in these States, Mr. J. W. W. Birch, the British Resident at Perak, was murdered, a force sent to apprehend the murderers was resisted; and the Residency in Sungai Ujong was menaced by bodies of Malays from some of the States near Malacca.

Under the prompt and energetic measures taken by the Governor, Sir W. Jervois, these outbreaks were suppressed in the course of about two months.

After the military occupation of Perak those concerned in the murder of Mr. Birch were captured and punished, some of the chiefs being banished to the Seychelles. In Perak, Selangor, and Sungai Ujong, Residents have been appointed, who are assisted by a staff of European officers, and it is their duty to aid the native rulers by advice, and to carry out certain executive functions delegated to them. The supreme authority in each state is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native authorities and the principal English officials. The Residents are directly under the Governor of the Straits Settlements.

Licences and customs, of which latter the duty on the export of tin is the most important, form the revenue of these States. The country, however, is otherwise rich, and offers great advantages for the cultivation of coffee, cinchona, tea, &c., on its high lands, and of paddy in the valleys. Since the war the increase among the Chinese has been very great.

Sir F. Weld in 1883 consolidated the relations of the Colony with the native states in the neighbourhood of Malacca which are known by the name of the Negri Sembilan. These states are Jelebu, Johol, Inas or Jelei, Ulai Muar or Sri Menanti, Jempol, and Rembau. Of these states Jelebu is under the control of the Sungai Ujong administration, while the others are now known as the Sri Menanti Confederacy, the government of which is carried on by state councils assisted by the advice of a superintendent, who is stationed at Kwala Pilah, a rising town on the River Muar, and the centre of a thriving tin mining industry. Jelebu is also rich in tin, and influential European syndicates have been formed to develop the resources of the state.

The Sultan of Pahang (a large state on the east coast), in 1888, requested and obtained the appointment of a British Resident in his state. The country is rich in tin and gold, and mining enterprise has begun on a large scale.
In addition to the above states, the Sultan of Johor in 1887 placed, in the spirit of former treaties, his foreign relations in the hands of this country, and has agreed to receive a British Agent.

The finance and trade of the states in 1887 were as follows:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Péraí   | $1,927,476  |
| Selángor | $1,550,489 |
| S. Ujong | $141,502   |
| Jeletu   | $6,309     |
| Negri Sembilan | $19,998 |

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| Péraí   | $6,951,963 |
| Selángor | $5,052,113 |
| S. Ujong | $899,415   |

Debt:
Selángor, $318,650; Sungei Ujong, $178,005; Negri Sembilan, $120,000.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 10 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom two are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts.

There is a Supreme Court which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once or twice a quarter at Malacca.

Defence.

Singapore harbour is defended by batteries just completed, to be armed with heavy ordnance. The military force consists of two garrison batteries of the Royal Artillery, one battalion of an infantry regiment and a company of the Eastern Battalion Royal Engineers (Malay Submarine Miners). There are also a few men of the China Gun Lascars (Sikhs) and of the several departments of the army. The whole of this force is at Singapore, except two companies of the infantry battalion, which are at Penang.

Climate.

The climate varies but little in temperature during the year. The mean temperature for 1887 was 81°-2 F., the range for the year between maximum and minimum temperatures observed during each month being 13°-9 F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. During 1887, the total rainfall was, in Singapore 113 inches, in Penang 145 inches, in Province, Wellesley 131 inches, and in Malacca 82 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time.

Population.

At the census of 1881 the population of the several settlements was as follows:

Singapore, 139,208; Penang, 90,951; Province Wellesley, 97,324; Malacca, 93,579; The Dindings, 2,822. Total, 423,384.

The following are the chief statistics of the census:

| Euro- | Malays. | Chinese. | Natives of India. |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Singapore | 2,769   | 22,155   | 86,766            |
| Penang   | 612     | 21,772   | 45,185            |
| Prov. Wellesley | 76 | 58,728 | 21,637 |
| Malacca  | 40      | 67,518   | 19,741            |

The result of the census in previous years was as follows:

| Census | Year | Total |
|--------|------|-------|
|        | 1866 | 273,000 |
|        | 1871 | 307,951 |
| Estimated | 1887 | 537,900 |

Trade.

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 2 cents or 1d. per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); rice (in Prov. Wellesley and Malacca), and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, and the Dutch Indies. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had on the 31st December, 1887, 268 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 28,596.
