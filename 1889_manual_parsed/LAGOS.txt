**LAGOS**

Situation and Area.

The Colony and Protectorate of Lagos is situated between 3° and 6° east longitude on the Gulf of Guinea. It now comprises the islands of Lagos and Ido, the northern district (Abouta Metta), the western district (Badagry), the eastern district (Palma and Leckie), and the kingdoms of Appa and Katunu on the west, with those of Mahin, Ogbo and Jakri on the east, reaching from the French settlements at Cootenoo to the Benin River, where the British Protectorate of the Niger commences.

Lagos Island has an area of 32 square miles, and the whole Colony and Protectorate includes about 1,071 square miles. The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,263 miles from Freetown, 815 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass.

The population of Lagos Island was in 1881 37,452. At that time the population of the Protectorate, as then defined, numbered 37,818. Of the total inhabitants more than two-thirds are pagans, the Christians being about 6,000, and the Mohammedans over 12,000. The present estimated population is 100,000.

**History**

The King of Lagos (Kasako) having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded by which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by King Docemo, the son and successor to Akitoye, and he was induced to cede his possessions on the 6th of August, 1861, to the British Crown, he being guaranteed a pension of 1,000l. a-year. He continued to draw this pension until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, it became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Ido Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Katunu, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying between Katunu and Badagry, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.
By further letters patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

**Constitution.**

The Government is conducted by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The latter includes three nominated unofficial members. The law consists entirely of local ordinances and Orders in Council, with such English acts as are of general application.

The Colony is associated with the West Africa Settlements and the Gold Coast Colony in contributing towards the salaries of the Bishop of Sierra Leone and the Inspector of Schools for West Africa, and also towards the subsidy paid for telegraph maintenance.

**Industry.**

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths, boat building, oil making, and brickmaking. A saw mill has recently been established.

Fishing is extensively pursued, the fish being dried and sent into the interior.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of the network of lagoons and creeks which extend in all directions. A very extensive trade has therefore grown up, amounting to nearly a million and a quarter sterling annually. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, ivory, gum copal, cotton and Guinea grains. The chief imports are spirits, tobacco, cotton goods and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France.

**Chief Towns.**

Lagos town has now about 40,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the whole West African coast. The next largest towns in the Colony are Badagry, Leckie, and Palma.

**Currency and Banking.**

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with some Spanish, American, and French gold coins. Cowries (40=½d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Gold dust is also current at 3l. 12s. per ounce. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders. There is no note circulation, and there are no private banks. A Government savings bank was established on the 1st January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on 31st Dec., 1887, had deposited 1,449l.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no railways or internal telegraphs, but Lagos Island is now in telegraphic communication with Bonny and Brass, the Gold Coast, and Europe, and via Accra, with the Gaboon, Loanda, and Cootenoo. There is also a weekly mail service to and from these places, and communication about once a month with Hamburg. With Brazil and the United States there is frequent communication by sailing vessels. The internal communication is chiefly by water, along the network of lagoons.

| India and the East | 5                 |
| Australia, South Africa, and St. Helena | 9 |

(Parcels to and from England, 9d. per lb.)

**Education.**

There are no Government schools, but regular grants in aid are made to those maintained by the various Christian sects, to the extent of 600l. per annum. The Mohammedans, who are much on the increase, maintain their own schools, where Arabic is taught. A system of Government inspection and examination is now being introduced for all aided schools, under the supervision of an Education Board and the Inspector of schools for West Africa. About 2,500 children are on the school rolls. Fees are charged, and education is not compulsory.

**Climate and Inhabitants.**

The mean temperature is 81°; the extreme range being from 74° to 88°. The rainy season extends from May to October, a lull occurring generally in July and August. The annual rainfall is about 60 inches.

The native inhabitants are mainly of the negro race; about one-fourth of them speak English. There are about 111 persons of European birth in the Colony.
