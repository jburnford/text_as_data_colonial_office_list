THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Area.

The Gold Coast is the name generally given to a portion of Upper Guinea, between 5° W. long. and 2° E. long., between which points are the settlements of Newtown, Axim, Dixcove, Secondoe, Elmina, Cape Coast Castle, Anamaboe, Salt Pond, Winnebah, Accra, Addah, Quittah, Dance, and Afflowhoo. The length of coast line of the English colony is about 350 miles, and the total area of the British colony and Protectorate about 29,401 square miles, including the districts of Appolonia, Wassaw, Denkera, Selwini, Akim, Croboe, Krikor, Crepee, and Aquamoo.

History.

French navigators are said to have discovered the Gold Coast in the fourteenth century. The Portuguese landed at Elmina in 1471. English,
Dutch, and Portuguese factories were established in the seventeenth century.

In 1672 a company was formed, called the Royal African Company, which built forts at Dixcove, Secondee, Commendah, Anamaboo, Winnebah, Accra, and Whydah, besides strengthening Cape Coast Castle, which was already in existence. It was succeeded in 1750 by the African Company of Merchants, constituted by Act of Parliament, with liberty to trade and to form establishments on the West Coast of Africa, between 20° N. and 20° S. lat. This company, which received an annual subsidy from the Government, suffered by the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and was dissolved in 1821 by Act of Parliament, and the forts transferred to the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlements. The fort at Whydah was abandoned.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of exciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Essamkow, where on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Doodewah, near Accra, in 1827. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831 between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4,000l. a-year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast Protectorate. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the Slave Trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, a Lieut.-Governor being appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of Native Affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

In 1850 the Danish forts at Accra, Fingo, Addah, and Quittah were purchased from the King of Denmark for 10,000l., the Danish Protectorate being at the same time transferred.

In 1852 a large meeting of the native chiefs (afterwards known as the "Legislative Assembly") agreed to pay a poll tax in exchange for British protection. This tax gradually fell in arrear and was abandoned, though some was received up to 1861.

Interspersed amongst the British settlements there had always been a number of Dutch forts. This circumstance was an abiding source of embarrassment to the British Government, as the Dutch settlements being free ports, no appreciable customs duties could be imposed at the British ports. A partition of the coast was therefore effected by a Convention, which came into force on the 1st of January, 1868, the Dutch taking the country west of the Sweet river, the British that lying to the east. The Dutch acquired Dixcove, Apollonia, Secondee, and Commendah; the British acquired Dutch Accra, Berraco, Appam, Cormantyne, and Moree. Her Majesty also relinquished to the King of Holland the protectorate over the two Wassaws, Apollonia, and Denkera.

The Dutch found their new possessions extremely unruly. Their authority was defied by the protected tribes of the interior, and their officers outraged and ill-treated on the coast; and by a convention, signed at the Hague in 1871, they abandoned to Great Britain the whole of their rights on the coast. Before the Convention was ratified, an assurance was first sought and received from the King of Ashanti that he had no claim on the Dutch settlements of Elmina. The formidable objection to the transfer arising out of this supposed claim having been removed, the forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872.

On 9th Dec., 1872, the King of Ashanti, from some unknown motive, despatched from Coomassie an army of 40,000 men to invade the British Protectorate. His army did not cross the Prah until the 29th of January, 1873. It then spread itself slowly over the country, ravaging as it advanced. In April it met and defeated the Fanti allies at Dunquah, and again in June at Jonquah. This victory encouraged the commander to attack the fortress of Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the seamen and Marines of the Fleet, in conjunction with the Colonial Forces, all under the command of the late Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing.

After this the war languished for some time, until the late Captain, afterwards Sir John Glover, was commissioned to repair to the eastern districts of the Protectorate, and organise the tribes in that quarter for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, now Viscount, Wolseley, was despatched with troops to the Gold Coast. The British troops arrived early in December, but a good road to the Prah not having been completed, they were sent to sea again. In the meantime Sir Garnet Wolseley, by the aid of native loyalties, West Indian troops, and seamen and Marines, had been driving the enemy towards the Prah, which they crossed in the end of November. The white troops landed towards the end of December, and Sir Garnet Wolseley and his head-quarters crossed the Prah on the 20th of January. The King of Ashanti now begged for peace, and sent the captive missionaries and others to the British camp; but as his language and acts were not satisfactory, Sir Garnet Wolseley continued his advance, and on the 31st of January came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoafu, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Coomassie. The King had fled to the bush. Negotiations were opened with him, but without result, and on the 6th Sir Garnet Wolseley quitted Coomassie and commenced his march to the Coast, the Royal Engineers firing the city as the force marched out. In the meantime Sir John Glover had been advancing from the east with Housseas and native allies, and on the 12th he passed through the burning ruins of Coomassie. On the 13th messengers sent by the King signed a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommannah, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Coffee. By the Treaty of Fommannah the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, to keep up a good road to the Prah, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs of gold. Since then King Coffee Kari-Kari
has been deposed and has died. He was succeeded by King Mensah, who, in his turn, was deposed in 1881.

Early in 1881 fresh troubles broke out with Ashanti, the affair having at one time a serious aspect. Awooso, a prince of Gaman, who was also connected with the Ashanti Royal family, escaped from Coomassie, where he had been kept under surveillance, to Elmina. He was followed by Ashanti ambassadors, demanding that he should be at once sent back. These envoys brought with them the golden axe, an emblem which was considered by the Government to be a threat of war. The demand was of course refused, and preparations were commenced by Lieut.-Governor (now Sir Brandford) Griffith for the defence of the Protectorate. Reinforcements from the West India Regiments at Sierra Leone and the West Indies were despatched, a small Naval Brigade was landed, and early in March Sir Samuel Rowe, who had just been appointed Governor, arrived. About the same time Ashanti messengers were sent to deny that any threat of war had been intended. The force in the Colony now consisted of about 1,200 men of the W.I. Regiments and Houssa Police. In April the Ashanti ambassadors were received by the Governor at Prahsu, and eventually an apology from them, together with 2,000 ounces of gold as an indemnity, was accepted. The gold axe was sent home as a present to the Queen.

After an interregnum of about two years, during which period much trouble and disturbance of trade was occasioned through intrigues assigned to replace Karl-Kari upon "The Stool," Quacoo Duah was elected king in April, 1884, but he died June, 1884, and up to April, 1888, when Prempeh, a descendant of the old royal house, was "stooled" as king, the throne was vacant.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by letters patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument the Gold Coast is defined as including all British settlements between 5° West longitude and 2° East longitude, and provision is made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Two unofficial members have been appointed to the Legislative Council.

By an Order in Council of 6th August, 1874, the Legislature was empowered to regulate by Ordinance or Ordinances all such powers as she may enjoy in the protected territories.

The Supreme Court of the Colony was a Court of Appeal for Lagos, and also under the West African Order in Council, 1884, but legislation providing for the establishment of separate courts of appeal in each colony was passed in 1888.

**Climate.**

The climate is unhealthy for the continued residence of Europeans, although yellow fever is unknown. The mean temperature is 82° F. in shade, the extreme range being from 68° to 87° in shade. The annual rainfall is about 60 inches, the rainy seasons being from March to July, and September and October, the latter being succeeded by the cool dry Harmattan from November to February. Dampness is the prevailing characteristic.

**Domestic Slavery.**

At its first meeting, the Legislative Council, under the Order in Council of the 6th of August, 1874, passed two ordinances disposing of the question of slavery.

Domestic slavery existed from time immemorial on the Gold Coast, as in other parts of Africa, the slave population consisting partly of native-born slaves, and partly of Donkos, slaves purchased from Ashanti importers. Slavery was mainly an emanation of parental authority, every man being saleable either by his father or mother, according to the character of the union subsisting between his parents, and the consequent status of the mother; but there was also a species of slavery called pawning, founded on contract, which arose when a debtor gave to his creditor, as a security, either himself, or a child or slave, to be a temporary slave in the hands of the creditor until debt and interest were paid.

Within the British possessions on the Gold Coast, slavery was abolished by force of the statute 3 & 4 Will. iv., c. 73, but no attempt had been made to deal with it in the Protectorate, which was not affected by that statute. The harsher usages of slavery were, however, appreciably mitigated by the action of the court of the "judicial assessor to the Native Chiefs" and other magistrates. At the conclusion of the war of 1873-4 the question was taken in hand anew, and settled by the two ordinances above mentioned. One prohibits, under penalties, the introduction of slaves into the Protectorate, and the buying and selling, and pawning of slaves and other persons within the Protectorate; and the second declares, that henceforth no court, native or British, shall take notice of, so as to give effect to, the relations between master and slave, except in so far as those relations may be in accordance with the law of England relating to master and servant.

**Means of Communication.**

Some four or five steamers of the "British and African," and "African Steamship" Companies leave Liverpool every month for the Gold Coast and other ports. Monthly steamers of the Woerman Line leave Hamburg also for the Gold Coast. The length of voyage from Liverpool to Madeira is about 7 days; and from Madeira to Cape Coast about 14 days. The Colony has entered the Postal Union, and a Post Office Money Order system is established with the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone. The parcels post is now in operation to Accra, Cape Coast Castle, and Quittah. The postage rates are the same as at Lagos (see page 145).

There is no railway in the colony, and, except in and near the towns, hardly any roads. The paths through the bush are kept free from the overgrowing vegetation by the native chiefs, who receive small presents for this service. There is a fairly good road from Cape Coast to Prahsue (75 miles), made by the troops in 1874, and another between Accra and Aburi, the Government Sanatorium, with paths thence to Akropong and Odumassie.
The principal water route is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and falls into the sea at Addah, after a course of 200 miles. It is however not usually navigable for more than 60 miles, and only for small boats. The Anocbra River is also navigable for boats for about 50 miles. The Prah is almost useless.

There is no harbour along the whole coast of the colony, and goods and passengers must everywhere be landed in surf-boats through what is often a dangerous surf.

A telegraph line has been erected between Accra, Christiansborg, and Aburi, and between Accra Cape Coast and Elmina, altogether a distance of 119 miles. An extension from Accra to Quittah, about 80 miles to the east, will be opened early in 1889. Accra is in telegraphic communication with England, via Sierra Leone, Bathurst, and St. Vincent, and also with Grand Bassam on the West, and with Lagos, the Niger, and with Cootenoo and the Portuguese and French Settlements to the South, viz., St. Thomas, Principe, St. Paul de Loando, and Gaboon, there being altogether four cables.

Defence.

An Imperial garrison of 200 men and officers (W.I. Regiment) is stationed at Cape Coast. Most of the stations along the coast have old forts, but there are no modern fortifications. A colonial armed constabulary force of 800 men is maintained.

Education.

There are Government elementary schools at Accra and Cape Coast, but education is chiefly in the hands of the Wesleyan ministers, the Roman Catholic Missions, and the German Mission Society. The Wesleyans have about 2,500 scholars in their schools, which are spread over the Colony, and they spend annually about 1,000l. on education, to which the Government has hitherto contributed 200l. The Basle Mission Society has about 2,200 scholars in 60 schools, scattered over the eastern parts of the Colony, and their annual expenditure on education exceeds 4,000l., to which the Government contribution has been 150l., in addition to 75l. to the Bremen Mission at Quittah. English is being taught in these schools, chiefly in the higher classes, and the Basle Mission Society also teaches handicrafts and agriculture. A system of grants based on results is being introduced. The total number of children at school is about 5,000.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling, with Spanish, American, and French gold coins, and gold dust at £3 12s. 0d. per oz., under Ordinance No. 2 of 1880. Some Mexican and other dollars and silver of the Latin Union are also current, but are not legal tender. Dutch silver still passes in the Western Province, and cowries (40 = 1d.) among the natives of the eastern Districts. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are no banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was opened in March, 1888.

Population.

No census has ever been taken, but it is estimated that the whole Colony and Protectorate now includes 1,426,450 inhabitants, of whom not more than 150 are Europeans. The chief towns are, Accra (20,000); Addah (7,000); Elmina (6,000); Cape Coast Castle (5,000); and Quittah.

Trade and Industry.

The staple products of the territories are palm oil and palm kernels. The palm does not grow near the coast, and the produce is brought down on the heads of carriers from an area extending forty miles inland, and by canoe down the Volta River from a greater distance. Gold is found in many parts, notably in the Wassaw district, in the north-west, of which Tarquah is the centre. The distance from the nearest port (Axim), and the lack of a good road, have proved obstacles to successful mining on a large scale, but the natives collect the alluvial gold for export in considerable quantities 81,168l. having been exported in 1887. India-rubber abounds in the interior forests, and is rapidly becoming an important export. Cotton grows wild, but is not cultivated. Small quantities of coffee and ground nuts are grown, and the exports also include monkey skins, ivory, copra, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood, and beniseed. The trade with Salagha and Ashanti is slight, owing to the difficulties of communication and the frequent native wars. Fishing is extensively carried on. There are but few manufactures, and these on the smallest scale. Native cloth is woven, fish is salted and cured, bricks are made, and simple boats built. Gold is worked into native ornaments with great skill. The chief imports are textiles, alcohol, hardware, and cooperage. Three quarters of the total trade is with the United Kingdom, the rest being with the United States and Germany.
