NEW SOUTH WALES.*

Situation and Area.

This Colony is situated on the eastern coast of the Australian continent, from Point Danger, and the 29th parallel, to Cape Howe, the boundary of Victoria. It is bounded on the west by the 141st meridian of east longitude; on the south mainly by the River Murray, and on the north by the 29th parallel.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' S. lat., and 151° 12' E. long.

The Colony contains 306,066 square miles (195,882,150 acres), of which 42,099,373 acres have been alienated.

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, when the convict station at Botany Bay was established.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole western shore of the continent. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean is 43° 5, to Grafton, 69° 0. On the coast it varies from 59° 7 at Eden, to 69° 0 at Grafton. Sydney being 61° 7, almost the same as Madrid (61° 4). On the mountains snow lies in some places all the winter. On the high table land at Bathurst the mean temperature is 56° 8, and on the inland plains about 70° 0.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases; at Deniliquin it is 18 inches; at Sydney, 49 inches; and the days on which rain falls, 141. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; only 25 per cent of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while in Sydney 60 per cent may be said to fall in torrents of from half an inch to 8 inches per day.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry, cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

In 1876 100,736,330 lbs. of wool, the produce of the Colony, value £5,655,173l., were exported; in 1878, 111,833,017 lbs., value £5,723,316l.; in 1879, 123,710,450 lbs., value £6,491,198l.; in 1880, 154,871,832 lbs., value £8,040,625l.; in 1881, 139,601,506 lbs., value £7,149,787l.; in 1882, 146,221,182 lbs., value £7,433,091l.; in 1883, 188,161,710 lbs., value £9,598,761l.; in 1884, 173,986,303 lbs., value £8,958,100l.; in 1885, 168,151,659 lbs., value £7,246,641l.; in 1886, 173,985,640 lbs., value £7,028,396l.; in 1887, 216,450,342 lbs., value £8,911,155l.; in addition to which, wool to the value of £289,916l., the produce of other colonies, was exported during 1887.

The live stock on 31 March, 1888, was as follows:—horses, 390,609; cattle, 1,575,489; sheep, 46,965,152; pigs, 264,111. Gold and coin, produce of the Colony, exported in 1880, was valued at £830,776l.; in 1881, £1,915,023l.; 1882, £1,697,791l.; 1883, £1,689,517l.; 1884, £934,406l.; 1885, £1,451,124l.; 1886, £1,619,936l.; 1887, £1,298,569l.

Coal to the value of £960,539l. was exported during 1887, and the other chief exports were maize (£5,438l.), wine (£6,654l.), tin (£25,420l.), copper (£199,102l.).

In addition to these products, tobacco, sugar, many kinds of fruit, kerosene, and other commodities are produced largely for home consumption.

The chief imports are textiles, alcohol, hardware, and books.

42·53 per cent of the import trade is with Great Britain, and 37·67 per cent of the export. Altogether Britain and British possessions absorb 91·47 per cent of the import, and nearly 89 per cent of the export trade.

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 438,889 tons, valued at £286,230l., while in 1881, 1,775,224 tons, valued at £603,248l., were raised from 40 mines; and in 1887, 2,922,497 tons, valued at £1,34C,440l., raised from 61 mines.

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1887, 75 vessels, of a total tonnage of 19,441.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was coined during 1887 to the extent of £2,173,306l.

The following banks have branches in the Colony:—

Bank of New South Wales, Commercial Bank, Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Australian Joint Stock Bank, London Chartered Bank of Australia, English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, City Bank, Federal Bank of Australia, Queensland National Bank, Bank of New Zealand, Commercial Bank of Australia, Mercantile Bank, National Bank of Australasia.

The New South Wales Savings Bank, established 1832, had, at close of 1887, 54,878 depositors, with £2,174,439l. deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 5l. per cent. per annum on deposits up to 100l. The Government Savings Banks, established
in 1871, had, on 31st December, 1887, 1,501,454l., deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on deposits from 1l. up to 200l.

Means of Communication.

There are more than 24,000 miles of common roads, 5,000 of which are metalled. In addition to 50 miles of bridges, there are 87 public ferries, 4 being worked by steam. There are 2,036 miles of railways, all owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been 26,554,357l. The receipts during 1887 were 2,208,295l., and the working expenses 1,457,761l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being 750,534l. There are also 504 miles of Government tramways, earning in 1887 229,772l. Of telegraphs there are 10,721 miles open, with 484 stations. The cost of construction was 684,600l., and the receipts during 1887 158,128l. Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, and the Hunter, while Port Jackson and Port Stephens are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the fortnightly vessels of the P. and O. and Orient lines, and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles) Union Company (via San Francisco) and North German Lloyd (via Genoa). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act of 1880. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. Education is compulsory up to the age of 14. In 1887 there were 2,236 State schools in operation, namely, 6 high schools, 3 for boys and 3 girls, 26 superior public schools, 1,612 public schools, 332 provisional schools, 194 half-time schools, 69 house-to-house schools under itinerant teachers, and 23 evening public schools. The Colony has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction may be imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective churches. For the year 1887 the Parliamentary grant for public instruction was about 561,087l., or 10s. 9d. per head of population. In 1887, 184,060 children attended the ordinary State schools, and nearly 1,200 were inmates of the orphan schools, industrial schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the blind. In 1887, private schools, including church schools, showed an attendance of 40,556 children.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1851. Its State endowment was originally 5,000l., but is now 12,000l. per annum—5,000l. additional having been voted in 1882, and 2,000l. more in 1883. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The Parliamentary grant for 1887 amounts to nearly 16,450l., and 22,929l. was expended by Government on buildings. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of 500l. per annum. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, and science. Recently several faculties have been added to its curriculum. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, attended by 429 pupils, and having a State endowment of 1,500l., and a total vote for 1887—for endowment, buildings, and salaries—of 2,400l. There is also a technical college for working men, and in the country towns there are about 150 'mechanics' schools of arts. Parliament has voted for 1887 over 26,000l. towards the support of schools of arts; and for technical instruction—in the college and in connection with the schools of arts and the evening public schools—a grant of 17,000l. is available. A Board of Technical Education, consisting of 24 members, has been constituted for the purpose of establishing a State system of technical education in the Colony. There are also a Royal Society, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, and an Art Society, with many other educational associations of a like character. For the Sydney Free Library a grant of 7,910l. has been voted for 1887; for the Museum and the Technical Museum, 9,400l.; and for the Fine Art Gallery, 6,050l.

The total State grant available for 1887 for educational purposes—as enumerated in the foregoing statement—was about 592,533l.

Defence.

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, George and Bradley's Heads, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

The Military Forces consist of:—(a) Regular Forces.—Artillery, 500; Submarine Miners, 24; Mounted Infantry, 32. (b), partially paid Volunteers.—Artillery, 514; Engineers, 97; Submarine Miners, 111; Mounted Infantry, 300; and Infantry, 2,940. (c), Volunteer Reserves.—Cavalry, 400; Artillery, 110; Infantry, 500; and Rifle Volunteer Companies, 2,000.

The Naval Forces are a Naval Brigade, numbering 328, partially paid, and 200 Naval Artillery Volunteers, purely voluntary. Including the general Staff, Volunteer, Permanent and Medical Staff, there is a total force of 8,140 of all ranks.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 12 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 55 municipal boroughs and 68 municipal districts, controlling property of the annual value of 6,336,021l., and having a revenue in 1887 of 419,381l., exclusive of loans, an expenditure of 500,469l., and an outstanding debt of 392,213l.

Constitution.

The first legislative council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in
1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54. The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council now consists of 60 members.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict., No. 13), consists of 124 members, representing 72 electoral districts; and provision is made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extends to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise is given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in District.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 10l., or of the annual value of 10l., respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Act of 1858, now repealed.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 180° 8' E. long.), and is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tuamotu) which is under French protection. It was discovered by Cartaret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1780, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1879 to 90.

NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of a small group of islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 48' E. long., the chief other islets being Hillip, Nepean, and Bird Islands. They comprise altogether about 12 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Capt. Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there from Botany Bay. This was removed in 1855, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 150 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population on 31st December, 1867, was 741. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There is but little regular administration, but the community is presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, with a simple code of laws. The community is under the superintendence of the Governor of New South Wales, and is visited occasionally by him, and by the magistrate of Lord Howe Island; but it does not form part of the Colony. Communication with the group is dependent on the casual visits of trading vessels or men of war. There is a resident doctor, and an efficient school. The chief village is Kington, on the largest island.
