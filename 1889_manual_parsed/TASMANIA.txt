portant gold-producing colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 41° 20' and 43° 40' S. lat., and 144° 40' and 148° 24' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Dieman's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1863. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1887 the mean heat of spring was 58°-58°, summer 63°-26°, autumn 51°, winter 48°-36°, of the whole year 55°-29°. Rain fell on 174 days in the year, and the rainfall is a little more than 24 inches.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,816 miles of telegraph (with 2,407 miles of wire) open in the colony. This includes 359 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph construction up to 31st Dec., 1887, was £55,711l., the receipts in 1887 being £20,715l., and the working expenses £20,757l.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Hobart and Launceston twice and sometimes thrice a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every fortnight. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Galle and London every two weeks, time 42 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 60 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Singapore, and Galle every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 70 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the Shaw Saville Line of steamers, one of which calls at Hobart every month.

There are 260 places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

Area.

The island contains 26,215 square miles, or about 16 million acres of land, and the islands connected with it contain 1 million acres; 4,572,649 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown; leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 12,205,351 acres, of which 1,175,445 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, including Flinder's Island, Robbius Island, King Island, and Bruny and Maria Island on the east coast.

Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 128 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government: all the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1887 the maintenance of main roads cost £18,036l., of cross and bye roads £22,667l.

Railways.

There are now 441 miles of railway in the colony constructed or in course of construction, mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. 318 miles of these are opened for traffic, and 123 miles in course of construction.

A line of 128 miles is worked by the Tasmanian Main Line Company; the colony guaranteeing to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on a sum not exceeding £50,000l. for 30 years. The total cost of railway construction is up to 31st Dec., 1887, was £2,818,582l.; the gross receipts in 1887 being £140,224l., and the working expenses £126,250l.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than 3s. an acre.

Any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at 1l. an acre, with 33 per cent. for credit, payable by quarterly instalments for 14 years.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of tin and gold exported in 1887 was—tin, 407,857l.; gold, 140,584l.

The land in cultivation on 31st March, 1888, was 457,436 acres. There were in the colony 147,092 horned cattle, and 1,547,242 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1887 was 9,740,230 lb., valued at 415,425l.

Almost the whole of the trade is with Australia and the United Kingdom.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, some of which are now being turned to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, and iron of the finest quality has been produced from them. Tin in immense quantities has been discovered at Mount Bischoff, the whole mountain being said to be intersected with veins of that ore. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper,
silver, and antimony have also been found, the copper yielding 30 per cent. of metal. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1887, 209 vessels, of 16,948 aggregate tonnage.

Population.

On 3rd April, 1881, the population of Tasmania was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females. The death-rate of 1881 was 14·77 to the 1,000 of the population, but for 1868-78 it was only 14 per 1,000. The number of inhabited houses is 21,858. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds. The estimated population, 31st December, 1887, was 142,478.

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1887) within the Registration boundary 32,458 inhabitants.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the colony, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 20,123 persons, and is rapidly progressing.

Local Government.

Municipal councils were established in Hobart and Launceston in 1855, when responsible government was granted to the Colony, and under the Rural Municipalities Act of 1865, councils have been established in 21 districts. These councils consist of seven elected members, two retiring annually for two successive years and three every third year. The president of the council, called the Warden, is elected annually by the councillors. The voters for the election of councillors are every male or female over 21 years of age on the assessment roll. In the districts where there are no municipalities the care of the roads is in the hands of Road Trusts. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, and Table Cape, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies in 1886 was £56,044l., and the expenditure £58,227l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are five banks established in the Colony, viz.: The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with, together, 28 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1887, amounted to £4,080,673l., deposits £3,832,137l. The note circulation on same date amounted to £49,939l.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the colony, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department; total deposits at time of last balancing, 31st Dec., 1887, being £48,281l.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1886 the Board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a director of education, working under the Minister of lands as ministerial head. The system is national and compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 215 state schools in operation on 31st December, 1887, the number of scholars on the rolls 16,527, and the average attendance 8,182.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and liberal course of education amongst the youth of the colony, the Council of Education was established on the 5th of November, 1886, with power to grant the degree of Associate of Arts; and scholarships were endowed to enable the more proficient youths to pursue their studies in a University of the United Kingdom. In all 21 scholarships and exhibitions are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17): by this Act a Legislative Council and House of Assembly are constituted, called "the Parliament of Tasmania."

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 20l. or leasehold of 80l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, elected for twenty-eight electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly is five years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to have his name included in the assessment roll of the district for which his vote is to be given as the owner or occupier of any property, or to be in receipt of income of 60l. sterling per year, for 6 months prior to 1st November in any year. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict. No. 32. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for four months.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

Defence.

The strength of the Colonial Volunteer Force is 839 officers and men. Batteries guard the mouths of the Derwent and Tamar rivers, and there are torpedo boats.
