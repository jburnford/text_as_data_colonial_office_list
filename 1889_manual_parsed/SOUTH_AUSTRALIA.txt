SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 380,070 square miles. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vic. c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude.

All the country from the 26th parallel of south latitude to the Indian Ocean, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The whole Colony covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, and includes an area of 903,690 square miles.

Kangaroo Island, Nuyts Archipelago, the Gambier, and other islands on the south coast, as well as Melville and Barthurst Islands, near Port Darwin, and Groote Eylandt, the Pellew Archipelago, and others in the Gulf of Carpentaria, are included in the Colony.

Adelaide, the capital of the Province, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S. and longitude 136° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

History.

The south coast of the Colony was surveyed by Flinders in 1802, and Sturt in 1829 discovered the Murray River and its upper tributaries. A colonization company, upon Wakefield's principles, was formed in England in 1834, under the Act mentioned above, and the first settlements were formed at Kangaroo Island and Adelaide in 1836.

Since the enlargement of the Colony in 1861 and 1863, it ranks as the third in size of British colonies.

Climate.

The climate is exceptionally dry; the rainfall at Adelaide averages 16 inches annually, mostly from May to August. The mean temperature is 74°, the extreme range being from 85° to 112°. The hot winds of December to February are disagreeable, but the climate is extremely healthy.

General Government.

The Constitution granted to South Australia by Her Majesty, by virtue of Imperial Act 18 and 14 Vic., c. 59, was proclaimed on the 24th October, 1856. Under that Statute the Parliament consisted of two Houses—the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly; the former being composed of 18 members, and the latter of 56. In 1873 the electoral districts of the House of Assembly were increased to 22, and the number of members to 46, and in 1882, to 26 and 52 respectively.

The Legislative Council is now elected by ballot, and consists of 24 members, returned under Act No. 236 of 1881. The Colony is divided into four electoral districts, viz.; No. 1, Central,
No. 2, Southern, No. 3, North-Eastern, and No. 4, Northern. On April 14th, 1888, and 1891, the members whose names stand first upon the roll retire, and their successors are appointed by each of the 4 districts electing 2 members. In 1894 and thereafter the first 2 members of each district will retire, and their places will be similarly supplied. Until all the old members who were elected under the former system have retired, vacancies by death, resignation, &c., are supplied by the districts in rotation, and subsequently by those districts whose members may have caused such vacancies.

The quorum of the Council consists of nine members, including the President.

The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the Queen, and that he has resided in the Province for three years. The qualification of a voter is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and have been on the electoral roll for a period of six months. He must also be possessed of either a freehold of the value of £5L or of a leasehold of the annual value of £2L having three years to run, or with right of purchase, or be in occupation of a dwelling-house of the annual rent value of £2L. The total number of voters for the Legislative Council 1887 is 31,954, or about 39 per cent. of the adult male population.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; and each of the 26 electoral districts returns two members. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be qualified and entitled to be registered as an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, a natural born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and have been six months on the electoral roll. The total number of electors in 1887 is 62,550, or about 76 per cent. of the adult male population.

Responsible government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature who form the Cabinet, and are ex officio members of the Executive Council.

Local Government.

There are 30 municipalities in the Colony, whose powers are regulated by the "Municipal Corporations Act, 1880." The governing body consists of Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors, elected by the ratepayers, who also elect the Auditor. The Council has power to levy rates for municipal purposes only on all house and land property within the municipal area, but the question of raising a loan must be submitted to a general meeting of the ratepayers, and a poll must be taken if demanded by six ratepayers. The aggregate assessment of the property within the municipal areas amounts to £2,109,088L, and the municipal revenue in 1887 amounted to £207,788L, and the expenditure to £198,585L. The aggregate local debt on the 31st December, 1887, was about £170,000L.

Population.

The population of the Colony at the close of 1887 was estimated to be 317,446 persons. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are about 6,000. There are about 250 Chinese in the colony. A poll-tax of 80L is levied on every Chinese immigrant.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide number 64,482 persons, or, including the suburbs, 130,000. About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 26 per cent.

Education.

The Education Acts passed in 1875 and 1878 provide that the management of public education should be committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free to those who cannot afford to pay a small fee; and compulsory wherever practicable. There are 517 schools, with 45,073 scholars.

The expenses of the Education Department for payment of teachers, &c., were, during 1887, £106,089L, towards which about £22,895L was received from fees and the rents of dedicated lands, the net cost to the state thus being £83,193L, exclusively of buildings. The total expenditure on school buildings up to the end of 1887 was £674,000L. The lands dedicated to educational purposes amount to 339,244 acres, and provision is made for setting apart 20,000 acres in future years. To the University of Adelaide, established in 1874, an annual grant is made of five per cent. on all sums contributed to the University from private sources (at present amounting to over £50,000L), and it has also an endowment of land. It had in 1887 179 students.

For the maintenance of the South Australian Art Gallery, Museum, and Institute, also country institutes in 1887, the sum expended was £18,210L.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the Province consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, Gladstone, and Palmerston, Northern Territory, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; and Police Magistrates' Courts.

Local Courts of civil jurisdiction are established in all the principal towns throughout the Province, arranged in circuits, and presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates.

The annual number of convictions in the Supreme Court has averaged during the last three years 200, or less than one in every 1,500 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community. The total value of the lands brought under the operation of this law to the end of 1887 amounts to £18,071,260L sterling.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money by way of
loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes. The amount of the Public Debt outstanding on 31st December, 1887, was 19,168,500l., and the total rate of indebtedness per head of the population was 582 12s. 8d. Against this liability, a sum of 2,574,647l. remains due to Government, for 2,250,336 acres of land sold under the credit system.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling. The local banks issue notes to the extent of about 400,000l., and had on 31st December, 1887, 5,251,006l. deposits.

Nine banking institutions carry on business within the Province, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 146 branches and agencies. Their names are: the Bank of South Australia, Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, National Bank of Australasia, English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, Bank of Adelaide, Bank of New South Wales, Commercial Bank of Australia, and Bank of New Zealand. The total average liabilities of the nine banks amount to (30th December, 1887) 5,712,295l., and the total average assets to 10,412,042l.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 96 branches. The total number of depositors 30th June, 1888, was 60,301. The total deposits amounted to 1,627,541l. One in six of the population is a depositor in savings banks.

Industry.*

It may be roughly estimated that not more than 250,000 square miles of the area of the Colony, excluding the Northern Territory, are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 300 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached 1,000 miles. Squatters have lately taken up large areas of land discovered by recent explorations (lying chiefly on the route of the overland telegraph), which are considered capable of carrying stock. Thirty-seven counties have been proclaimed to 31st December, 1887, embracing 61,408 square miles, or 39,301,120 acres. Of this large area only 9,376,704 acres have been alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to upwards of 120 acres for each male adult in the Colony. About one in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to sale, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 1,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, &c. At present there is as much as 2,112,312 acres of land surveyed and open for immediate selection.

About two-thirds of the total area of land cultivated is cropped with wheat, of which 1,950,000 acres were reaped in 1887. The area of wheat grown has increased more than 100 per cent. during the last 10 years.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry. There are 4,500 acres of land devoted to this purpose. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines of the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants.

Almond trees are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment.

The Colony possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and general superiority over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. In 1887 there were no less than 186,985 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 170,000; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 440,000; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 7,264,000, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 180,944 bales.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, and there are now many steam flour mills, saw mills, foundries, agricultural implement works, breweries, &c. Several marble and slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened, and recently an extensive quarry of marble has been opened at Kapunda.

The gasworks of the Colony are eight in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, and the remaining six are in the principal country towns.

312 vessels of 38,483 tons were in 1887 registered at Port Adelaide and Port Darwin.

Out of 3,348,561l. worth of staple produce exported, the value of breadstuffs amounted to 1,090,831l.; while wool represented 1,358,116l., and copper 240,833l.

The total value of wool shipped in 1856 was 412,163l.; 1866, 990,163l.; in 1886, 1,955,207l.; and in 1887, 2,086,775l.

The chief imports are textiles, sugar, alcohol, coals, hardware, and machinery. 85 per cent. of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australian colonies; the bulk of the remainder being with the United States, China, and Mauritius.

The trade and shipping of Port Darwin were as follows:

Means of Communication.

There are 4,250 miles of road defined in the settled districts. The greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 2,012. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

The railways are all constructed and worked by the Government. The mileage opened for traffic in the Colony is 1,419, and the mileage of new lines in course of construction is 403. Up to June, 30th, 1887, the total cost of the railways reached 9,161,783L. The receipts in 1887 were 688,207L, and the expenditure 402,183L.

The geographical position of South Australia necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. To accomplish this South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over 400,000L., across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party.

At the close of the year 1887 there were 206 stations, and 5,486 miles of line open throughout the Colony, and there are several lines now in course of construction.

Internal water communication is afforded by the Murray River, on which steamers run for 2,000 miles. There is regular and frequent communication by mail steamers with all parts of Australasia, as well as with Europe and San Francisco. The rates of postage are:

Defences.

There is a permanent staff of 46, and volunteer forces numbering 2,912 officers and men. The naval force consists of H.M.S. "Protector," 11 guns, with an establishment of 176 officers and men. Batteries have been erected at Glanville and Largs Bay, to protect the harbour of Adelaide.
