DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, were by the Imperial Act 30 Vic., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 27th of May, 1867. The essential provisions of this Act are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vic., cap. 3.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16 May, 1871, issued under the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 26th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was incorporated by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada, from the 1st of Sept., 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1584 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the Queen, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The seat of government, until the Queen shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 80 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, and has been raised by additions on the accession of new provinces and by the increase in population to 215; 92 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 21 Nova Scotia, 16 New Brunswick, 5 Manitoba, 6 British Columbia, 6 Prince Edward Island, and 4 The Territories. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $1,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons $10 a day during the session, with a maximum of $1,000 per session. A parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, with a franchise almost equal to manhood suffrage. The session usually extends from February to May.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not remov-
able within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The provincial legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. During the last session of the Dominion parliament an Act was passed providing for a legislative assembly in the North-West Territories, to consist of 22 elected members and 8 legal experts appointed by the government. Each assembly is to continue for three years. Four members are selected by the lieutenant-governor to form with him an advisory council on matters of finance.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the provincial legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and naturalisation, and native affairs.

The powers of the provincial legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior district and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the Probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, according to the census of 1861, except that the subsidy of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is to increase each census till the population in each case reach 400,000. Each Province also receives an annual allowance for Government, and for interest on the amount by which its debt at the Union fell short of the authorised amount.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislatures require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the Queen.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. Both these have now been opened.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In Ontario the system is to be found in the most complete and symmetrical form, towards which the others closely approximate. The organization comprises (1) townships or rural districts of 8 or 10 square miles with a population of 3 to 6,000, administered by a reeve and 4 councillors; (2) villages with a population of 750, governed like the township; (3), towns with a population over 2,000, governed by the mayor and 8 councillors for each ward if there are less than five wards, and 2 councillors if more than five. The Reeves, deputy Reeves, mayors, and councillors are all elected annually by the ratepayers. Above these stands the county municipality consisting of the Reeves and deputy Reeves of the townships, villages, and towns within the county, one of these who presides being called "Warden" of the county. Alongside the county stands the "city" with a population of over 10,000, governed by a municipal body of mayor and 8 aldermen for every ward, with powers and functions akin to those of counties and towns combined. The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except Labrador, see page 181, and Alaska, which belongs to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,470,257 square miles, exclusive of the great lakes and rivers. The greater part of this is comprised in the North West Territories. The seven settled Provinces of the Dominion comprise about 822,527 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

Total | 3,695,524 | 4,324,810 |

A census of the three provisional districts of The Territories, viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, was taken in 1885, showing a population of 48,362, of whom 20,170 were Indians. A census of Manitoba was taken in 1886, and the population found to be 108,640. After making allowance for the territory taken from this province, there was an increase in population since the census of 1881 of 74-5 per cent. The estimated total popula-
tion of the Dominion on 31st December, 1887, was 4,922,679.

About 1,800,000 of the people are of French extraction, over a million of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 128,761 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 14,000 half breeds. They are under the supervision of government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. There are over 7,000 Chinese in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

### Industry

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Coal and gold (in British Columbia and Nova Scotia), and copper (principally in Ontario) are extensively worked. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and manufactures of wood, leather, and musical instruments. The principal imports are textile manufactures, coals, hardware, tea, sugar, raw cotton, hides, and tobacco.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1883 was as follows:

- 1883 $17,215,675
- 1884 $17,766,404
- 1885 $17,722,973
- 1886 $18,679,288
- 1887 $18,283,878

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is estimated at 60,000.

Tonnage of vessels on Register Books of the Dominion, 31st December, 1887, was 1,180,247 tons, of which 5,988 sailing ships were 952,058 tons, and 1,240 steamers 178,189. The number of seamen employed was about 140,000. Canada stands fifth on the list of nations in respect of tonnage, France standing sixth, and Italy seventh.

### Railways

The length of railways actually constructed in the Dominion on 30th June, 1887, was 12,332
miles, with 11,691 miles in operation. Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems. The total capital invested amounted to $683,773,191 on 30th June, 1887. The total quantity of goods carried amounted to 16,356,235 tons. The number of passengers was 10,698,633, and the distance travelled by trains was 33,638,748 miles. The total receipts were $88,842,010, and working expenses $27,624,688.

The Dominion Government own and maintain 1,204 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $50,022,259. The working expenses in 1886 were $3,152,649, and the receipts $2,840,747.

In November, 1886, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are now running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and the Imperial Government have granted a subsidy of $300,000 for a monthly service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama.

Telegraphs.

There are 28,498 miles of telegraph line, and 59,941 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 2,911 are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 4,052,684 messages were sent in 1887 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 2,637, being one to every 2,060 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain and Newfoundland, and also a deep sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. The telephone is in operation in many of the towns, over 8,000 miles of wire being in use.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. The total length of canals proper open is about 135 miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 8,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts in 1886-7 were $321,738, and the working expenses $484,709. Over fifty-one million dollars have been expended on the construction of these canals.

Currency and Banking.

There is a uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills., $4.863 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

There are Government savings banks in three provinces, having about 51,000 depositors. There are also Post Office savings banks in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, having 90,159 depositors.

The total amount of savings bank deposits on 31st December, 1887, was $50,803,400.

The following banks are established in Canada:

In the same month, 1887, the banks had a note circulation of $34,854,595. In 1877 they held $69,763,668 of deposits, and on 31st December, 1887, they held $112,902,614. In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and on 31st December, 1887, had notes in circulation amounting to $15,702,101. The maximum Government issue is fixed at twenty million dollars, and the minimum reserve in specie and British Government securities is fixed at 25 per cent. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government.

Post Office.

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended 30th June 1887, was 74,800,000, of postcards 16,356,000, and of newspapers (other than those sent from the office of publication, which are all carried free), periodicals, parcels, &c., 31,180,000. The number of newspapers sent from the office of publication was about 60,000,000. The number of letters per head of population was 15.24. The number of offices was 7,584. The revenue for 1887 was $2,603,255, and the expenditure $3,458,100.

There is weekly mail communication with Great Britain, via Quebec or Halifax, and twice a week via New York. There is a through daily service by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Pacific coast.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, News- | Newspapers |

There is a parcels post to Newfoundland, the United States, and Europe.

**Defence.**

There is an Imperial naval station at Halifax, N.S., which is strongly fortified, and defended by a garrison of 1,500 men. The defence of the Dominion rests, however, mainly with the local forces. The Canadian Militia for some years past has been under the immediate command of a Lieutenant-General of the English Army. The Dominion is divided, for military purposes, into twelve districts, with a Deputy Adjutant-General, and a Brigade Staff in charge of each. The active Militia numbers 38,000 men, and the reserve Militia consists of all adult males between 18 and 60 (with certain exceptions) who are not serving in the active Militia. There are included in this force 45 batteries of garrison artillery, and 18 of field artillery, and 48 troops of cavalry. There are three royal schools of gunnery, one school of cavalry, four of infantry, and one of mounted infantry, and the Dominion Government in 1875 established a school of scientific military instruction at Kingston, known as "The Royal Military College," presided over by Major-General Cameron, R.A. The number of officers and men permanently embodied and engaged in garrison or instruction duty is 868.

Esquimalt, in British Columbia, has become an important coaling station, and is strongly fortified and garrisoned by Colonial Artillery.

**Chief Towns.**

The towns in the Dominion having more than 10,000 inhabitants in 1886 were as follows: Montreal (186,257); Toronto (118,403); Quebec (66,000); Hamilton (41,280); Halifax (40,000); Ottawa (34,783); St. John, N.B. (30,900); Winnipeg (28,000); London (26,047); Portland, N.B. (17,000); Kingston (15,000); Brantford (12,600); Charlottetown (11,000); Guelph (10,216); St. Thomas (10,127); and St. Catherines (10,000).

II. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497; but this is not certain. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days, and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonization were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by one Kirk, but was retro-ceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-Laye.

From 1763 to 1774, Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were allowed the free exercise of their religion: the Catholic Clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), dividing Canada into two Provinces, upper Canada (now Ontario) and lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1838. The most fruitful causes of dissension were the right of the Assembly to control public expenditure, and the question of the "Clergy Reserves," lands appropriated by the Imperial Act of 1791 for the exclusive benefit of the Anglican Clergy. The immediate exciting cause of the Rebellion was the establishment, by Governor Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton) of 37 rectories in Upper Canada. After the reduction of the insurgents, the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 8 and 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. The new House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. In the same year (1840) also, Municipal Institutions were established in Canada.

The Provincial Legislature was empowered by Act 17 & 18 Vic., cap. 118 (1854), to constitute the Legislative Council an elective body.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.
In 1855 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "dead lock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in council, advised by five or more cabinet ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 90 members; Quebec 60 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in council.

Industry.

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. The cattle and meat trade is also assuming considerable proportions, large exports of this kind being shipped annually to England. The same remark applies to dairy produce.

The lumber trade is extensive; and manufactures of hardware and textile fabrics are largely carried on.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for the elementary (public) schools, of which there are 5,437, with 487,496 scholars in 1886, and for the secondary (high) schools, which number 110, and contain 15,344 scholars. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational), university (Toronto) with an affiliated university college, and three theological colleges are also affiliated. There are also five denominational colleges with university powers in the province, and numerous high schools or colleges for girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There are 4,000 schools, with nearly 200,000 scholars. There are nearly 300 secondary and model schools, with 40,000 pupils, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

Chief Towns.

Besides those mentioned at p. 56, the chief towns are, in Ontario, Belleville, Chatham, Windsor, Peterboro, Woodstock, and Stratford; and in Quebec, Trois Rivières, Levis, and Sherbrooke, with from 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants each.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation and Area.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Carso, forms part of the province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1589; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander by James I. in 1627. In 1639 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of the province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

The harbour of Halifax has an area of about 10 square miles, is open at all seasons, and its navigation is scarcely ever interrupted by ice. This harbour is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for, it is said, 1,000 ships. The British Government has an extensive dockyard at Halifax, which is its principal naval station in North America. The other chief towns are Annapolis, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, and Sydney (in Cape Breton).

The climate is remarkably healthy, and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion, but fogs prevail on the coast. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°. The average annual rainfall is 50 inches, evenly distributed.

Coal and iron ore are plentiful, and gold also
has been discovered, and is yielding fair returns; but the greater portion of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the growth of fruit. The superior fisheries, together with the ship-building and timber trades, give occupation to many.

**Constitution.**

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 21 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for a term of years, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected by manhood suffrage every four years.

**Education.**

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1886 there were 2,000 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 105,410 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

The total cost of education is $650,000. There is an examining university at Halifax, and five sectarian colleges.

**Provincial Finances.**

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation and Area.

New Brunswick is situated between 45° 5' and
48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 47' and 67° 53' W. long.;
its area is about 27,005 square miles, or 17,000,000
acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low
isthmus.

History.

New Brunswick, in the early part of the last
century, belonged to the French, and was called
by them New France. At the peace of 1763,
New Brunswick, with the rest of Canada, was
ceded by France to Great Britain, and was
annexed to Nova Scotia until 1785, when it was
erected into a separate Colony. It was first
colonized by British subjects in 1761, and in 1783
by disbanded troops from New England.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 40°, the
extreme range being from 11° below zero to 82°.
The average annual rainfall is 35 inches, and the
snowfall 158 inches, the latter extending from
November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant; antimony, iron, and gypsum
are to be found also in very large quantities. A
great portion of the country is covered by dense
forests of fine timber, the cutting and working
of which—cr " lumbering"—furnishes remune-
rative employment to many. Wheat, Indian
corn, barley, and oats, are the principal cereals
raised. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and
river. Fredericton, 80 miles inland, is the capital
(pop. 7,000), but St. John, on the mouth of the
river of the same name, is the leading commercial
centre (pop. 30,000). Other towns are Portland
(16,000), and Moncton (6,000).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian
Senate by 12 Members, and sends 16 Members to
the House of Commons.

There is also a Legislative Council of 18 mem-
bers, appointed by the Governor for life, and a
Legislative Assembly of 41 members, elected
under a liberal franchise.

Education.

A system of elementary education was estab-
lished by Act, 1871. The central control is
vested in a Board of Education, and the local
management is in the hands of Boards of School
Trustees. Education is free between the ages of
5 and 20. There were 1,500 schools, with 90,000
scholars in average attendance, in 1887, and the
total cost of elementary education in that year
amounted to $418,967.

There is a university at Fredericton, and several
colleges.

MANITOBA.

Situation and Area.

Manitoba was erected into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vic., c. 3, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-53° N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 60,520 square miles, with a population in 1887 of 112,000.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, fearing that they would be subject to a possibly stricter form of Government, rose in insurrection, and established a provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871 the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid. Mr. Archibald, isolated, and without the aid of troops, took measures for its defence, and with this view accepted the co-operation of Riel and Lepine. The attack never took place.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence for two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights, chiefly in view of the acceptance of his services by Lieut.-Governor Archibald.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of this province are very highly spoken of. The soil is a rich black loam. The growth of Winnipeg, the chief city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants. In 1881 it had a population of about 10,000, and now has about 25,000. The other chief towns are St. Boniface, Emerson, Brandon, and Portage la Prairie.

For some years the province could only be reached by railway through the United States, but in 1881 the portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg was opened, and in 1886 the whole line was completed. All the important centres now enjoy railway communication, and further construction is proceeding rapidly.

The free-grant lands are almost all taken up, but good farms can be purchased at from $2 to $10 per acre. The area occupied in 1885 was 4,171,224 acres, and the area under cultivation 752,571 acres, of which 432,134 acres were under wheat, and 155,176 acres under oats. The production of wheat in 1887 was 12,851,724 bushels, and of oats 7,265,327 bushels.

Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg in only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 in., and snowfall (Nov. to April), 53 in.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 3 members in the Dominion Senate and 5 in the House of Commons. It had also an assembly of 30 members, elected by manhood suffrage. By the new Redistribution Act the number has been increased to 38. The Legislative Council, or Upper Chamber, was abolished by local Act 28 of 1876.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control is in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively, and the local management is entrusted to school trustees elected by the people. Education is free, unsectarian, and compulsory between the ages of five and sixteen. There are 580 schools, with a total of 20,000 scholars, and an average attendance of about 14,000; the cost of education in 1887 was about $500,000 from local sources and $66,000, from legislative grant. For 1888 the legislative grant has been raised to $120,000.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers, and in 1887 provision was made for establishing intermediate and high schools, which has since been carried into effect by the establishment of three high and eight intermediate schools in connection with Protestant public schools.

There is one university, styled the University of Manitoba, with examining and degree conferring powers only. The affiliated Colleges are S. John's (Episcopal), S. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), and the Manitoba Medical College.

**British Columbia.**

**Situation and Area.**

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast, bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, and on the south by the United States—the average breadth being about 250 miles, and the length of coast line 450 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 341,000 square miles.

**History.**

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island, discovered in 1762, was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and six in the House of Commons, of Canada.

**Constitution.**

The Provincial Government is administered by a lieutenant-governor and legislative assembly of 27 members on the system of executive administration known as a "Responsible Government."

**Description.**

The population is about 80,000, of whom 30,000 are Indians, and 7,000 Chinese.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains: the climate is for the most part drier, and the snow falls consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; the exports amount to nearly four millions annually (a remarkable fact considering the number of the population); they consist of minerals (chiefly gold and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon and oil), timber, furs, skins, &c. The imports amount to two and a half millions, principally from Eastern Canada, England, the United States, China, &c.

The province has produced over fifty million dollars of gold, and although the production for 1887 is less than in some former years, it is expected that the prosecution of quartz mining, now in its infancy, will, in the near future be a most important industry.

The lumber trade is fast attaining large dimensions, the shipments from the two principal mills, during 1886, amounting to over 30,000,000 feet. Timber is abundant in all parts of the province.

The chief towns are Victoria (12,000) and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (4,000), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (5,000), and Vancouver (7,000). Esquimalt is a fortified coaling station.

**Education.**

A complete system of free common school education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in a Superintendent of Education, acting under the Provincial Secretary, and the local management is in the hands of three trustees, elected annually by the people in each school district. Education is free and compulsory.
between the ages of 7 and 12 inclusive. There are 103 schools with an enrolment of 5,845 pupils. The total cost of education for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1888, was $110,000.

The schools are free and non-sectarian; school districts being formed wherever there are fifteen pupils between the ages of six and sixteen.
