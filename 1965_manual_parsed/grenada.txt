**GRENA DA**



**Area**



The total area of the Colony is 133 square miles. In addition to the island of Grenada it includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.



**Population**



The population at the census on 7th April 1960 of 88,677 is for the most part coloured. There is a small white population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers. The estimated population at 30th June 1963 was 91,967.



**Principal Town**



The capital, St. George's, has a population of 7,305.



**Geographical Features**



In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The

highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon's Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.



Climate



Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month and November the wettest.



History



Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of 1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from the French West India Company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George's. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the French Company and passed to the Crown of France in 1674.



Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795–96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.



Constitution



The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua (see page 57).



Taxation



Forms of direct taxation include income tax, estate duties and property tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale, varying from 5 cents to 65 cents in the $ for individuals (on chargeable income for the year immediately preceding the year of assessment). Companies pay at the rate of 40%. There is a land tax of 25 cents per acre; and house tax is levied on a sliding scale varying from $1·20 per house of rental value between $24 and $28·80 per annum to 8½% in the case of houses with rental value over $144 per annum. Other forms of taxation include import, export and excise duties and motor vehicles tax.



Public Finance



| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |

|------|---------|-------------|

| 1959 | $7,482,470 | $7,005,526 |

| 1960 | $8,115,021 | $7,656,046 |

| 1961 | $8,053,479 | $8,190,395 |

| 1962 | $6,620,456 | $8,930,313 |

| 1963 | $8,389,440 | $8,388,814 |



At the end of 1963 the Public Debt amounted to $12,389,710 (including Hurricane Rehabilitation Loan from the United Kingdom Government of $6,930,496) and accumulated Sinking Funds to $1,214,262.



Currency



The currency of the Colony is the West Indian dollar which is linked to sterling at the rate of $4·80 to the £.



Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands and Trinidad) in a common currency.



Notes issued by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) and the Royal Bank of Canada continue as legal tender but are being withdrawn and the banks' powers of note issue have been terminated. Meanwhile United Kingdom coinage has also largely been replaced by the Board's own dollar coinage, though the diminishing United Kingdom coinage continues as legal tender.



Development Plans



Under the 1945, 1950, 1955 and 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts Grenada received allocations totalling £1,736,121; a further allocation of £150,000 has been made under the Commonwealth Development Act 1963.



The Development Plan 1964–1966 envisages a total expenditure of £468,750, the main sources of development funds being Colonial Development and Welfare grants and loans raised by the Government in 1950 and 1960. Development in the agricultural sector is estimated at £156,250, with education and tourism taking £98,334 and £89,375, respectively. The major projects under education are school buildings and teacher training while under tourism the lengthening of Pearls Airport to accommodate Viscount aircraft is estimated to cost approximately £58,334. There are also water supply projects based on a long term plan, which are being undertaken.



Progress has been made in the direction of attracting external investment for the development of the tourist industry which the Colony is not in a position to finance. A step forward has also been made in setting out Government's policy regarding Morne Rouge development in the interest of tourism.



Education



There were 56 Primary Schools in the Colony with rolls totalling 25,676 pupils at 31st December 1963. Average attendance in 1963 was 20,869 or 81·2% of the total enrolment. Compulsory attendance is not at present enforced. Eleven of the primary schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy for gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned buildings of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.



There are four handicraft centres. In addition five schools have well-equipped handicraft rooms. There are also four domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at five other schools.

A visual education unit serves the whole colony. Six Secondary schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,846 (end 1963). Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one is co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate and G.C.E. standard and the Grenada Boys' Secondary School, the Presentation Boy's College, the St. Joseph's Convent, St. George's and the Anglican High School also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The actual cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1963 was $1,280,865.00.



The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships one tenable at a University in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the University of the West Indies Faculty of Agriculture.



Libraries, etc.



There is a free public library in St. George's and branch libraries in each parish. In addition there is an island-wide book mobile service.



Health



A W.H.O. Campaign for the eradication of Aedes Aegypti was started in 1953 and completed at the end of March 1962 with great success and with only the island of Carriacou still positive. In March 1961 Dr. Van Seventer, a W.H.O. Entomologist, conducted an Aedes Aegypti survey in Carriacou for the purpose of finding a proper insecticide to complete the Eradication Phase. Since then regular perifocal treatment has been conducted. There has been no reported case of malaria either from this island or the mainland and Grenada has now been declared free of Malaria.



The W.H.O.-U.N.I.C.E.F. also assisted with the B.C.G. campaign in 1954, with follow-up in 1955 and 1956 and subsequent incorporation of the programme into the normal activities of the Health Department; also with a scheme for the supplementary feeding of school children, expectant and nursing mothers: the last is still in progress.



In 1956 a treponematosis campaign was undertaken with the object of eradication of yaws and a reduction in the incidence of venereal diseases. Evaluation and surveillance which have been continuing since then have shown that yaws has been eradicated.



The Colony Hospital of 240 beds is at St. George's. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew's, is a modern building, recently constructed and provides 32 beds. Addition of a Children's Ward has been completed. The district hospital in Carriacou which was completely destroyed by the hurricane of 22nd September 1955 has been rebuilt and was opened on 16th July 1958. It has been named the Princess Royal Hospital. A Children's Ward has been constructed.



There are 28 district Medical Visiting Stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Maternity and child welfare work is carried on in all these stations. There are three main Health Centres at St. George's, Goyave and St. David's, and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.



Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1963 amounted to $1,242,822 compared with $97,987 in 1935.



Communications



Pearls Airport is located at the North Eastern Corner of Grenada (12° 09' N.; 61° 37' W.).



Runway—Direction 082/262.



Dimension 4,000 feet × 150 feet (Colas). Stopway 1,200 feet × 150 feet (Grass).



Tower Frequency. 118·7 mc/s.



Non-Directional Beacon. "ZGT". 362 kc/s.



British West Indian Airways Ltd. operates daily scheduled services through Pearls Airport, linking Grenada with other West Indian Islands. These schedules vary with the seasons and are adjusted to ensure regular connections at Trinidad and Barbados to other parts of the world.



There are approximately 566 miles of good roads divided into four classes. Class I—188½ miles, Class II—136½ miles, Class III 148 miles, Class IV—93 miles. About 356 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.



The St. George's Harbour at the south-west of the island is Grenada's chief port. Its outer harbour is an open roadstead with 5–10 fathoms, sand bottom, good holding ground. The inner harbour or careenage is a well sheltered natural harbour located between Fort George Point and a point about a quarter of a mile to the south-eastward. Berths for two ocean-going vessels with length of 400–500 feet are available on the eastern side of the inner harbour alongside an 800 ft. long pier with a minimum depth of 30 feet alongside. Berths for small craft are available on the Western side of the careenage and also along 400 feet on the eastern face of the pier.



Entrance to the inner harbour is through a channel with minimum width of 600 feet and minimum depth of 45 feet. The channel and entrance are marked with buoys. Leading marks located on shore lead to the pier. Turning basin in inner harbour is 900 ft. × 600 ft. approximately.



No tugs are available or necessary. Pilotage is not compulsory but advisable. Pilots are available and require prior notice. Transit shed on wharf. Cargo is usually handled by ships' gear but two 6 ton mobile cranes are available. Lighters with total capacity of 350 tons are also available. Good potable water is laid on to the wharf. Bunkers are not available except light diesel oil for small craft.



The other ports, Granville and Hillsborough in Carriacou are mostly used by small craft.



Regular cargo services are provided by Harrison Line Steamers and by vessels chartered by Geest Industries Limited from United Kingdom ports; by the Saguenay Shipping Company from Canadian ports; by the Booth, Lampart and Holt and American Defence Lines from the United States ports and by the Royal Netherlands Steampship Company from European ports. The Federal Shipping Service together with several small motor vessels, auxiliary and sailing vessels take care of the cargo services between the islands and also provide a useful passenger service.



Several foreign ships make frequent calls at this port to take immigrants to the United Kingdom. Passenger travel to the U.S.A. and Canada, however, has to be made through Trinidad or Barbados.



During 1963, 603 motor and steam and 266 sailing and auxiliary motor vessels with a total net tonnage of 797,467 and 9,758 respectively called at Grenada.

Broadcasting



A Broadcasting Service for the Windward Islands, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, was inaugurated in 1955. Transmissions take place on short waves from a 5 kW transmitter and cover the Eastern Caribbean.



The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations



A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.



In 1955 a statutory body, the Grenada Banana Co-operative Society, was set up to control the production and marketing of bananas.



One farmers' society and eight fishermen's unions were registered under the Friendly Societies Ordinance in 1954.



A Co-operative Department was established in 1957. It now consists of a Registrar of Co-operatives, a Co-operatives Officer, 2 Junior Co-operatives Officers and two clerks. The Department is responsible for promotion work as well as registration, supervision and audit.
