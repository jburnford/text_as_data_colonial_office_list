SEYCHELLES



Area



Its land area is approximately 100 square miles, exclusive of Aldabra Lagoon estimated to cover about 55 square miles.



Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad and is estimated to cover 55½ square miles.



The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf or Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijouter Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.



Population



The population at mid-year 1963 was estimated to be 45,089.



Principal Town



Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 10,500.



Geographical Features



The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.



Over seventeen square miles are under forest and woodland.



Climate



In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the past 58 years is 91·38 inches and the mean temperature was 76·5°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.



History



The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May 1794 when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Ile de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for seventeen and the British for sixteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.



Constitution



The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. Under a 1960 Order in Council the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, four ex officio members, five elected and three nominated members of whom at least one must be an unofficial. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.



Land Policy



All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.



Taxation



The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. This is chargeable on all earned or investment income arising in or derived from the Territory. In addition tax is payable by residents on investment income arising out of the Colony or on earned income remitted thereto, the basis of assessment being income arising in the calendar year preceding year of assessment.



Rates of tax, after deduction of allowances, are:



- 5% on first Rs. 1,000 of chargeable income

- 10% on next Rs. 4,000 of chargeable income

- 15% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income

- 22½% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income

- 30% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income

- 40% on next Rs. 10,000 of chargeable income

- 50% on next Rs. 20,000 of chargeable income

- 60% on next Rs. 50,000 of chargeable income

- 65% on any excess over Rs. 100,000.



Companies, partnerships, etc., pay a flat rate of 35%.

Allowances are made to resident taxpayers:



Earned income ½ th (max. Rs. 2,000).

Personal (single) Rs. 1,750.

Personal (married) Rs. 3,500.

Children . . . Rs. 800 for the first child

Rs. 700 for the second child

Rs. 500 for each child thereafter (max. Rs. 3,000).

Additional allowance of Rs. 3,500 may be claimed for child studying abroad (max. Rs. 7,000).



Dependent relative Rs. 500 (limited to one relative) if relative is infirm, maintained by claimant and not in receipt of an income exceeding Rs. 500.



In addition, allowances may be claimed in respect of life insurance, superannuation, alimony and deductions against plant and machinery owned and operated by the assessee.



A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.



The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.



Public Finance



| Year | Revenue Rs. | Expenditure Rs. |

|------|------------|-----------------|

| 1959 | 4,913,931  | 5,663,645       |

Libraries



Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust and there are small libraries run by the Co-operative Book Society, the Roman Catholic Mission and the Alliance Française.



The Carnegie Library also has three small branches: two at Praslin and one at La Digue.



Health



Although within the tropics, Seychelles has few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent, filariasis is infrequent and there has been no smallpox for many years. Several cases of leprosy are however found each year. Amoebiasis and other intestinal parasitic diseases such as ankylostomiasis, giardiasis, helminthiasis and balantidium coli dysentery are becoming even more common than before. Poor conditions of sanitation and increasing overcrowding are the main causes of this increase. There has been no progress in the programme for improving sanitation in Victoria which is the most crowded area.



There has been considerable progress in the tuberculosis follow-up scheme. This scheme followed the W.H.O. (World Health Organization) survey of TB in 1961, when at least 1,600 persons were found to require further investigation. In January 1963 there remained 180 suspect active W.H.O. cases and 1,041 suspect inactive cases. The 180 suspect active cases and 267 suspect inactive cases were investigated in 1963 as well as 843 contacts of proven active cases. It was hoped to finish the investigation of W.H.O. cases in 1964. Here follows a brief résumé of figures for 1964.



At the end of 1963 there were:



(a) Cases under treatment before 31st December 1962 . . . 169

(b) Cases notified during 1963 . . . 188

(c) Cases discharged cured 1963 . . .

(d) Cases died 1963 . . . . . . 8

Total cases still on treatment end December 1963 . . . . . . 349



A sanatorium of 86 beds was completed in 1964. This sanatorium, in conjunction with amended public health laws, will help considerably in isolating open cases of tuberculosis and it is hoped that the segregation thus possible will reduce the number of new cases. Help is being sought from W.H.O. in connection with the problem of tuberculosis which is presently the most pressing Public Health problem.



Venereal diseases have shown a slight increase over 1962. The increase is for both syphilis and gonorrhoea. Together with the high rate of new infections, there are a large number of persons with latent stages of syphilis. (Some 12% of all Khan Reactions are positive; and Khan tests are routine for the catering trade, new Government employees, labourers for outer islands and for ante-natal patients). For the control of this disease application has been made to W.H.O. for help.



Public Health Service is under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health. Staff shortages have, however, so far made it necessary for the M.O.H. to spend much of his time doing ordinary medical officer's duties. Until a full-time M.O.H. is available, the Public Health Section will remain handicapped. In spite of these difficulties the Public Health Section is continuously increasing the range and type of its work.



Under the Chief Health Inspector (who returned after a successful year's study in North America under W.H.O. auspices) the Health Inspectors have tried to improve hygiene and sanitary methods while helping in home education for feeding and dieting of children. Under the Chief Health Inspector are 7 Health Inspectors of whom one is stationed in Praslin district. There are 14 Public Health Nurses of whom one is in Praslin and the others are in Mahé. Of these, three are entirely occupied with TB nursing while most of the others include TB nursing with their other duties which are mainly child and maternal welfare. The maternal welfare clinics are run in co-operation with the Medical Officer in charge of the Maternity Unit. Of 1,088 deliveries in 1963, only 12 women had not previously consulted the ante-natal clinics during their pregnancy.



Child Welfare Clinics are also well attended. These are run in conjunction with U.N.I.C.E.F., which provides equipment, and Colonial Development Funds which are employed to build the health centres. So far, 3 of these centres were in use by the end of the year but a total of 17 places are used for the clinics which are held in Mahé, Praslin and La Digue. The U.N.I.C.E.F. milk and vitamin scheme is also controlled from the Child and Maternal Health Centres. 130,000 lb. of milk was distributed in the year July 1963–June 1964 and this amount is increased for 1964–65.

Communications



There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.



There are 80 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet. Tarmac surfacing and widening to 20 feet of all roads is in progress, 44½ miles having been completed.



A thrice-weekly service by a new motor launch, carrying some 100 passengers is in operation between Victoria, Mahé and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. Passenger ships of the

British India Line and of the Eastern Shipping Corporation combine to operate a service calling twice a month (once eastward and once westward) in the case of the former line, and twice every alternate month eastward and once westward in the case of the latter. The British India ships run from Durban to Bombay, and the Eastern Shipping Corporation operates from Dar-es-Salaam and Mombasa to Bombay.



Occasional passenger-carrying cargo boats run directly from London (Brocklebank Line) or from Singapore (Royal Interocean Line).



Broadcasting



Radio Seychelles at Victoria Road, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for two hours on a wavelength of 60-12 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 100 W. The service is under the direction of the Director of Tourism and Information. Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.



No receiving licences are issued.



Principal Occupations



The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 6,500 are so employed. Approximate numbers employed in other occupations in 1963 were:



- Domestic service: 2,100

- Public Works: 3,000

- Public administration: 300

- Trade and commerce: 480

- Skilled workers: 2,580



There are eleven registered Trade Unions:



1. The Seychelles Teachers Union,

2. The Seychelles Cable and Wireless Limited Staff Union.

3. The Seychellois Christian Workers Union.

4. The Seychelles Government Workers Union.

5. Licensed Bakers Union.

6. The Seychelles Stevedores Winchmen and Dock Workers Union.

7. The Union Lighterage Workers and Staff Union.

8. The Seychelles Government Un-Established Staff Union.

9. Seamen Union.

10. Transport and General Workers Union.

11. Seychellois Civil Servant Union.



Main Crops and Products



The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.



An agricultural census was held in October 1960 when livestock was recorded as:—Cattle, 1,589; Goats, 260; Pigs, 3,058; Poultry, 21,673; there are also some 6,000 wild goats in Aldabra Island.



Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,500-2,000 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.



Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawl'shull turtles) are exported.



Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.



Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally-made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production is increasing.

Tourist Trade



The number of bona-fide tourists who visited Seychelles in 1963 was 770 and a further 586 up to 21st August 1964. Insufficiency of sea communication and entire absence of air transport are still hampering development of this otherwise promising new industry.
