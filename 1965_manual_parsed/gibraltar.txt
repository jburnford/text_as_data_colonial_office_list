GIBRALTAR



Geographical Features and Area

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, with an area of 2½ square miles. It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles and its greatest breadth nearly 1 mile.



Population

The population is European and at the Census of October 1961 numbered 24,075. At the end of 1963 the estimated population was 24,287.



Climate

The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the "Levanter", strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.



History

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Elliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.



Constitution

Under the Gibraltar (Constitution) Order in Council 1964, Gibraltar attained a large measure of internal self-Government.



Executive authority is exercised by the Governor, who is also Commander-in-Chief, but in the exercise of his functions the Governor whilst retaining the usual reserved powers is normally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Gibraltar Council which consists of 5 elected members and 4 ex-officio members, the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Permanent Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. The elected members of the Gibraltar Council are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Chief Minister and are styled Ministers and charged with such departmental responsibilities as may be assigned to them. There is a Council of Ministers presided over by the Chief Minister who may also appoint to it such additional Ministers as he wishes.



The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker appointed by the Governor, 11 elected members and 2 ex-officio members, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.



The Permanent Secretary performs the functions of the Governor during his absence or incapacity.



A City Council deals with Municipal affairs and public utilities. It consists of 7 elected members, 3 nominated Service representatives and one nominated Government representative, and is presided over by a Mayor elected annually from among the elected councillors.



Taxation

This is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance came into force in 1953; the standard rate of tax is 3s. in the £, but rates for individuals range from 6d. to 4s. in the £. There are no excise duties.



The main heads of taxation are:

- Customs.

- Income Tax.

- Estate Duties.

- Stamp Duties.

- Licences.

- Fuel Oil Tax.



The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco, coffee, mechanical lighters, motor vehicles, motor vehicle spares and accessories, photographic cameras and cinema projectors, radio sets and spares, razor blades, watches and clocks, fountain pens, including ball-point pens,

binoculars, telescopes, sound recorders, sound reproducers and recording media.



The Government lottery yielded £147,450 in 1963.

Gibraltar Government notes and United Kingdom silver and copper coins are legal tender in the Colony. Notes to the value of £1,497,446 10s. were in circulation at 31st December 1963. The issue is governed by the Currency Note Ordinance and is of the following denominations: £5, £1, 10s.



Development Plans



To keep pace with increasing tourist traffic, improvements and additions were carried out to a number of existing hotels. In addition to three new hotels, a Casino, an open air theatre at the Alameda Gardens and the extension to the Air Terminal building, were completed early in the year. The roads in the Upper Rock were widened and resurfaced and electronic light and sound equipment (in several languages) was installed in St. Michael's Cave, the Upper Galleries, Moorish Castle and the Apes Den.



Other buildings completed during the year were three Mackintosh Homes for the aged and a cultural and educational centre (Mackintosh Hall).



Preliminary negotiations were carried out during the course of the year with Samuel's Properties Ltd. of London about the proposed development of the Casemates area at the entrance to the city. This project envisages the construction of multi-storey blocks of flats, shops, offices, parking areas, an hotel, a new public market and many other amenities.



Plans for the construction by Bland Aerial Ropeway Ltd. of an aerial ropeway from Alameda Parade to Signal Hill at the top of the Rock were approved and the necessary documents and contracts signed. The ropeway is expected to be in operation early in 1966.



The site of Spanish Pavilion, formerly a military property in Main Street, was acquired by a British company who plan to build on the site a block of flats, offices and shops. Work on the demolition of the old buildings has been completed.



Work began on the first block of a three-year housing construction project financed from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund (£200,000), a loan from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (£400,000), and local resources.



Extension of present school facilities was carried out during the year and plans were prepared for new schools costing over £100,000.



Education



There are six secondary, fourteen primary and infants and two Technical and Vocational Schools conducted by the Department of Education, with a total of 4,032 pupils at 31st December 1963. In addition there are three unaided schools with an enrolment of 688. Government expenditure on education in 1963 amounted to £186,919 compared with £9,863 in 1935.



Approximately 41 students of both sexes are undergoing courses of higher education in the United Kingdom.



Libraries and Museums



A lending library is maintained by the British Council. At the Gibraltar Garrison Library, established in 1793, an extensive reference section and a well-supplied lending library are available to members. The Museum contains exhibits of historical interest connected with Gibraltar.



Health



Total expenditure on medical and public health services in 1963 was £254,112 compared with £22,966 in 1935. The number of beds available in hospitals was:



- St. Bernard's Hospital (General)

  - including King George VI Memorial Wing: 120

  - King George V Hospital: 60

  - St. Joseph's Hospital: 60



The number of in-patients at the St. Bernard's Hospital during 1963 was 3,255 and out-patient attendances numbered 8,890.



Communications



There is a R.A.F. Aerodrome at North Front which is also used by Civil Aircraft by agreement with the Air Ministry. British European Airways operate daily services between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom both direct and via Madrid. Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service (two flights) to and from Tangier.



The length of road open for traffic is 5¼ miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3¼ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.



The total arrivals of merchant vessels during 1963 were 4,006 with a net tonnage of 11,460,162. The majority called for bunkers, the discharge of cargo and passengers, provisions and repairs. The following passenger services were in operation:



- Orient Line, United Kingdom/Australia: 2 monthly

- Union Castle Line, United Kingdom/East Africa: 2 monthly

- P. & O. Line, United Kingdom/Australia: 2 monthly

Anchor Line, United Kingdom/India

Zim Israel Line, Haifa/Italy/New York



Approximately one cargo vessel a week arrived from the United Kingdom. A daily passenger and car ferry service to and from Tangier is operated by the Bland Line. There is also a daily passenger service between Gibraltar and Algeciras.



Sound and Television Broadcasting.



The Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation formed late in 1963 is now responsible for radio and television broadcasting with Thompson Television International as the managing agents.



G.B.C.-Radio (Radio Gibraltar) broadcasts in English and Spanish for approximately 16 hours daily, an average of 30 hours weekly being devoted to commercial broadcasting. In addition to live and locally recorded programmes, use is made of B.B.C. transcriptions and relays. The power of the station is \( \frac{1}{2} \text{kW} \) and it operates on a frequency of 1,484 kc/s, 202.2 metres. During 1963, 4,019 radio receiving licences were issued.



G.B.C.-T.V. operates for 3\(\frac{1}{2}\) hours daily in English with occasional live shows and some advertising in Spanish. The station operates on the standard European system of 625 lines on Channel 6. There were over 3,050 licensed T.V. sets at the end of 1963.



There is also a local wired broadcasting system operated by the British Forces Broadcasting Service which relays programmes from the B.B.C.



Principal Occupations



Almost half of the male wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Gibraltar Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment.



There are a number of small industrial concerns roasting and blending coffee, processing tobacco, canning meat and manufacturing ice, mineral water, sweets and various items of clothing for local needs and export.



At the end of December 1963 the total insured labour force was 15,776. There are 25 registered trade unions in the Colony. The reported total paid-up membership of the 16 workers' unions was 3,254 and of the 9 employees' unions 302.



Trade



Actual figures of imports are available only for dutiable articles and the figures given below are therefore largely estimates:
