BARBADOS



Area, etc.

Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands. Its total area is 166 square miles.



Population

On the 31st December 1963, the estimated population was 240,341.



Principal Town

Bridgetown, the capital, is the only town. Before the 1960 census its population was estimated at about 11,304.



Geographical Features

The Island is comparatively flat, rising in a series of tablelands marked by well-defined terraces to the highest point (1,104 feet) at Mount Hillaby. The north-east corner of the Island, the Scotland area, is broken country, much eroded and rather barren. The formation of the rest of the Island is coral limestone. There are no rivers, but deep gullies which fill with water during heavy rain have cut their way through the coral terraces in many places. Indigenous forest covers about 46 acres.



Climate

The climate is extremely pleasant. North-easterly trade winds blow steadily from December to June but during the remainder of the year, the wet season, the wind moves to the south-east and is less strong, resulting in humid, hotter conditions. The average temperature is 79-8°. The rainfall

is very varied; in the high central district the yearly average is 75 inches while in some of the low-lying coastal areas the average is 50 inches.



History



Uncertainty remains on some points in the early history of Barbados and differing versions have appeared from time to time. The brief account which follows is based on what is taken to be the most authentic version.



As far as is known the original inhabitants were the Arawak Indians who migrated from the mainland of South America. When they arrived is not known, but relics of their occupation down to the latter years of the sixteenth century have been discovered in various parts of the Island. By the time the English settlers came they had disappeared, partly through Carib raids from the neighbouring islands, and partly through the Spaniards who deported them to work in the mines of Hispaniola.



In spite of the belief to the contrary, there is no satisfactory evidence that the Olive Branch under Captain Catin ever touched at Barbados when it was driven off its course from England to the River Wiapoco settlement in 1605 and fetched up at St. Lucia. The first Englishman to visit Barbados may have been Captain Simon Gordan, who claimed that he had landed some time before the settlement of 1627 and had found the Island uninhabited. He may, however, have been on a ship under the command of Sir Thomas Warner that visited sometime between 1620 and 1624 and found the Island suffering from such a severe drought that the latter preferred settlement of his colonists at St. Kitts. In 1624 or early 1625 a ship, belonging to Sir William Courteen and under the command of Captain John Powell, touched at Barbados, when en route from Pernambuco to England; some men were landed who erected a cross and on a tree nearby inscribed "James K. of E. and of this Island". On receiving Powell's information about Barbados Sir William Courteen fitted out an expedition to the Island under the command of his informant; but Powell, who carried letters of marque, captured a Spanish or Portuguese prize and returned with it to Cowes in 1626. Courteen then fitted out a second expedition and in February 1627, the William and John under the command of Captain Henry Powell—Captain John Powell's younger brother—landed 80 settlers. During 1627 and 1628 the colony grew rapidly and by the end of 1628 it was claimed that Courteen had planted 1,850 settlers. The Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I for all the Caribbean islands and landed settlers in 1628. After his death his son leased the Island in 1647 for 21 years to Lord Willoughby of Parham who assumed the government of the Island and during the Civil War held it for the Royalists until his capitulation to the Cromwellian fleet in 1652. A Governor was appointed by the Commonwealth in place of Lord Willoughby and at the Restoration the claims of the Carlisle Patent were revived. An agreement was reached by which the Patent was surrendered to the Crown for compensation in the form of 4½% duty on exports. This duty was a continual source of complaint but was not abolished until 1838 by Act of Imperial Parliament. The importance of the agreement, however, is that it marked the end of proprietary rule. Since its settlement Barbados has been a possession of Great Britain.



Constitution



Barbados has one of the oldest constitutions in the Commonwealth and one in which conventions play an important part. Amendments to the constitution, providing for full internal self-government came into operation on the 16th October 1961, and further amendments were made and embodied in Statutory Instrument No. 491 which was brought into operation on 9th April 1964.



The Legislature consists of the Governor, an Upper House—the Senate—consisting of 21 members appointed by the Governor, twelve of whom are appointed on the advice of the Premier and two on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition; and a Lower House—the House of Assembly—consisting of 24 members elected by universal adult suffrage. The life of both Houses is now limited to five years.



The revised Constitutional Instruments include provision for a Privy Council, a Cabinet, and the establishment of Judicial and Legal Service, Public Service and Police Service Commissions with executive powers to deal with appointments, dismissals and disciplinary control of members of the services for which they are responsible.



The Privy Council consists of the Governor and other persons (at present four, including the Minister designated Attorney-General and the Premier) appointed by Her Majesty. It advises the Governor in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Public Service and the Police Service who may appeal to the Privy Council against disciplinary action recommended to be taken against them.



The Cabinet consists of the Premier and not less than 5 other Ministers—there are at present 7—appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier; it is the principal instrument of policy.



The Governor appoints as Premier the member of the House of Assembly who appears to him best able to command the support of the majority of the members of the Assembly. On the Premier's advice the Governor appoints other Ministers from among the Senators and the members of the House of Assembly. The Premier and other Ministers hold office during the Governor's pleasure.



Land Policy



The systems of land tenure are similar to those of the United Kingdom.



Taxation



Income tax is the main form of direct taxation. The tax rates range from 3 cents on every complete $ of taxable income up to $500, to 75 cents on every complete $ of taxable income beyond $24,000. Tax is not paid on incomes below $800 per annum in the case of single individuals and $1,400 in the case of married persons. A wife's earned income allowance not exceeding $300 is granted. Deductions from assessable income of $270 to $600 (varying according to the age of the child, and educational establishment at which full time instruction is being received) are allowed for children and $240 for other dependants, in the latter case not exceeding two. Deductions are also permitted in respect of life insurances paid. Medical expenses may be deducted in excess of $20 but not exceeding in the aggregate $100, in the case of a tax-payer of married status, or $50 in the case of any other person, plus $25 for each child, not exceeding two. Companies pay a flat rate of 40%. The rate for life assurance companies and building societies is the average paid by an individual with a taxable income of $4,800.

A non-cumulative system of Pay As You Earn is in operation.



Estate duties range from 1% on estates exceeding $4,800 and not exceeding $14,400 to 30% on estates over $1,920,000. In addition, succession duty ranges from 1% between $96 and $2,400 to 2% of values exceeding $9,600 where the successor is a lineal descendant or ancestor 1% to 6% where successor is a brother, sister or their descendents, and from 2% to 10% where the successor is a stranger.



Entertainment tax is charged on certain forms of entertainment.



The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariffs and excise duty on rum production.

**Education**



Education is provided by Government at the following levels: Primary, Secondary, University, Adult and Further. Primary Education is provided in Government Primary Schools, Secondary in the Senior Departments of the Primary Schools, the Government Comprehensive (formerly Secondary Modern) Schools, the Secondary Grammar Schools maintained by Government and in some Private Independent Schools. Present policy aims at the introduction of compulsory education for all children between the ages of 5 and 14 years.



Tuition at the Primary and Comprehensive levels is free. Tuition fees were abolished for Barbadian children in the Government maintained Grammar Schools from January 1962. The Preparatory Departments of these schools were abolished at the same time. A Common Entrance Examination for children between the ages of 10 and 12 was instituted for entry to Government Grammar Schools. Improved and additional accommodation in the Primary and Comprehensive Schools is being provided under a School Building Programme by the extension and replacement of existing schools and construction of new schools where necessary.



There were, in 1963, 117 Primary Schools (31 for boys, 34 for girls and 52 co-educational, including 6 infant schools), 5 Comprehensive Schools and 10 Secondary Grammar Schools entirely maintained by Government. The number of children in the Primary Schools at the end of

The Housecraft Centre specialises in Domestic Science and Home Economics training for girls.



Government awards from its own resources yearly: five Barbados Scholarships (one restricted to girls) to the University of the West Indies and Commonwealth Universities overseas, two exhibitions, three special awards (in Engineering, Agriculture and one for girls) and ten enabling Bursaries all to the University of the West Indies, as well as teachers scholarships and enabling grants to students of exhibition standard for study at University level. There is also a Higher Education Loan Fund, established in 1953, from which loans are made to students for University study abroad. A number of awards, Commonwealth scholarships for example, are also available from donor Governments and external agencies annually for University and postgraduate study abroad.



Government makes an annual subsidy towards the University of the West Indies which now has constituent colleges in Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados. In addition Government meets the tuition fees of all Barbadians who are full-time students of the local Colleges of Arts and Science established in 1963. Codrington College, formerly a degree-granting affiliate of Durham University in England, is now a theological seminary.



During the academic year 1962–63 there were 97 Government scholars, exhibitors, teacher trainees and bursars attending universities overseas—37 in the United Kingdom, 2 in Canada and 58 at the University of the West Indies. 35 Students were granted loans from the Higher Education Loan Fund. Of these 10 were attending universities in the United Kingdom, 17 were at the University of the West Indies, 1 at a university in the United States of America, 3 in Canada, 3 in India and 1 in Germany. In addition, there were some 20 students taking advantage of awards from external aid agencies and donor Governments for further studies abroad.



Evening classes in academic, commercial and technical subjects and in the fields of Handicraft and Home Economics are conducted under the aegis of the Barbados Evening Institute and through the Extra Mural Department of the University of the West Indies at some 27 centres throughout the island. Students enrolled in the Institute's classes during 1962–63 numbered 2,702.



Expenditure on education in the financial year April 1962—March 1963 was $5,732,396 compared with $1,974,705 in 1952–53 and $566,205 in 1942–43.

set up by Order-in-Council of the Barbados Government in 1963. The wired system, which covers the whole island and had 25,412 subscribers at the 31st December 1963, is operated by Barbados Rediffusion Service Limited, a local subsidiary of the London firm of Rediffusion Limited.



Principal Occupations



Most of the population is engaged in the cultivation of the sugar crop and auxiliary occupations connected with the sugar industry. Approximate figures are: 19,500 persons engaged in agriculture, 2,000 in domestic service, 12,500 in the retail trade and 8,500 in construction work. About 1,700 persons are engaged in the fishing industry.



At the end of 1963 there were nine Trade Unions of which 3 were employers' associations with membership totalling about 340 business concerns and six workers' organizations with about 15,500 members.



Main Crops and Products



Sugar cane is the principal export crop grown on all plantations and on nearly all small holdings. In 1964 sugar production was the equivalent of 161,000 long tons.



Yams, sweet potatoes, eddoes, cassava, maize and pigeon peas comprise the main food crops which are grown in accordance with regulations issued annually. Green vegetables and other crops are cultivated on a minor scale and there is a limited production of tree crops and citrus fruit. A marketing Corporation has been established by statute for the purpose of improving the facilities for marketing in order to encourage an increase in the production of food crops, meat and dairy produce and fish.



The estimated numbers of livestock are as follows:



- Cattle, 10,240; Pigs, 15,794; Sheep, 20,268; Goats, 7,828; and Poultry, 225,903.



A Central Livestock Station has been established to investigate the possibility of developing an economic system of animal husbandry, with special attention to dairying.



A Fisheries Section of the Ministry of Agriculture was established in 1944 for the investigation of more efficient methods of marine fishing and to encourage their use. Large scale mechanisation of the fishing fleet has been practically accomplished with the assistance of loans from Government. Cold Storage facilities are available for meat and for fish and a shrimp industry being developed. The estimated catch of fish during 1963 was 6,277,383 lbs.



Production of natural gas during the year ended 31st March 1964 was 117,662 million cubic feet. During 1963, 4,392·0 tons of temper, building and manurial limestone were exported.



Manufactures include the production of sugar for local consumption, rum, bread and a variety of biscuits, edible oil, aerated waters, cigarettes, soap, ice, furniture, jewellery, mattresses, lumber, ready-to-wear garments, shoes, batteries and building products.
