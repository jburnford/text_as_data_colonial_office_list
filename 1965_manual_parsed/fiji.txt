FIJI



Area



The aggregate land area is 7,015 square miles, most of it contained in the two main islands of Viti Levu (4,011 square miles) and Vanua Levu (2,137 square miles). About 100 of the total of 320 islands are inhabited. The dependency of Rotuma (18 square miles) lies some 400 miles to the north of Fiji.



Population



The population enumerated in the census of Fiji, 27th September 1956 was 345,737:

Geographical Features



The islands comprising the Colony straddle the 180° meridian and lie about 1,200 miles south of the equator. Most of them are of volcanic origin but some are of limestone formation. There are no active volcanoes though hot springs occur in isolated places. All the larger islands are surrounded by coral reefs. Mountain ranges of moderate height—the highest peak is 4,341 feet above sea level—lie athwart the prevailing easterly trade winds and there is consequently a marked difference in the heavy forest vegetation on the windward and the light reeds and grasses on the leeward slopes of most islands. The country is well watered and rivers are numerous. The total forest area is approximately 3,486 square miles.



Climate



The climate is oceanic and tempered by cool east or south-east breezes which blow between May and October. During the rest of the year winds are variable and tropical storms, known locally as hurricanes, may occur. High humidity, which sometimes reaches saturation point, causes unpleasant living conditions while it lasts. Rainfall varies from an annual average of about 120 inches in Suva to 75 inches on the leeward coast of Viti Levu. The diurnal range of temperature at Suva, a few feet above sea level, is about 11°, but recordings between 60° and 90° are not unusual.



History



The first navigator to discover islands in the Fiji archipelago was Tasman in 1643. Cook charted a small island in 1774 and Wilson discovered others in 1797. Bligh of the Bounty recorded most of the Group in 1789 during his memorable voyage in an open boat after being cast adrift by the mutineers.



Christianity was introduced into Fiji by Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga in 1835.



Cakobau (or Thakombau), an influential Fijian chief, offered to cede the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain in 1858 in exchange for support against his rivals and help in meeting his debts, but the offer was refused. After a further unsettled period, Cakobau renewed his offer of cession. The Deed of Cession was signed at Levuka on the 10th October 1874. In 1882 the seat of government was moved to Suva because of its better harbour and greater facilities for expansion.



Rotuma was discovered by Captain Edwards in H.M.S. Pandora in 1791 during his search for the Bounty mutineers. In the nineteenth century the principal Rotuman chiefs repeatedly offered to cede the island to Great Britain, in order to prevent the continuance of a succession of religious wars. Rotuma was formally annexed in 1881.



Constitution



The Government of the Colony is provided for under the Fiji (Constitution) Order in Council 1963 and Royal Instructions. The Executive Council, presided over by the Governor, consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, as ex officio members and seven nominated members, including a European, a Fijian and an Indian from the unofficial members of the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Speaker (first appointed in 1956) and consists of not more than nineteen official members and eighteen unofficial members, of whom six are Europeans (four constituency members and two nominated), six Indians (four constituency members and two nominated) and six Fijians (four constituency members and two elected by secret ballot by the Council of Chiefs, itself consisting of elected and nominated members).



A Membership System of government was introduced on 1st July 1964. Under this System, three unofficial members have been appointed to the offices of Member for Natural Resources, Member for Social Services and Member for Communications and Works.



A local government system, first established in 1876, and since 1945 known as the Fijian Administration, has jurisdiction over all Fijians in the Colony, a system based on indigenous institutions. At the apex is the Council of Chiefs, presided over by the Secretary for Fijian Affairs and Local Government. In executive control is the Fijian Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs and Local Government as chairman, the Fijian members of Legislative Council, a Legal Adviser, and a Financial Adviser. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs and Local Government is the executive officer of the Board and he is assisted, in each of the three administrative divisions into which the Colony is divided, by a Commissioner, who is in charge of the division and responsible to the Governor, through the Colonial Secretary, for the efficient administration of his division, including Fijian affairs. District Officers act as inspectors of the local government units but do not intervene in their management.



In Rotuma, where language and customs differ from those in Fiji, the District Officer is the chief executive authority and he also has limited magisterial powers. A Rotuman Council, consisting of the District Officer and a number of Rotumans, makes regulations of local application. Such regulations shall not have effect unless and until they have been approved by resolution of the Legislative Council.



Land Policy



Soon after the date of the cession a commission investigated the title to lands claimed by foreigners and as a result freehold titles to some 400,000 acres of Fijian land were granted. The Fijians now own 84% of the land, the unit of ownership being the mataqali or extended family. Surveys of mataqali holdings have been made following determination of boundaries by Native Land Commissions and a complete record of these family units is maintained. Under the Native Land Trust Ordinance of 1940 the control of all Fijian-owned land is in the hands of an independent Board administered on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Fijian owners. The Board has power to set aside certain areas of land as reserves for the exclusive use of the Fijian owners and to lease land outside such reserves without reference to the owners. The sale of

Fijian-owned land is prohibited except to the Crown and then only where it is required for a public purpose. The sale of Crown Land is prohibited except in very special circumstances. Subdivision of land in specified areas is subject to control by a statutory board and development in and around the ten principal urban centres is regulated by Local Authorities in conjunction with a Central Town Planning Board under a Town Planning Ordinance.



**Taxation**



Customs duty and port and customs service tax are levied on most imports. Income tax rates range from 1s. 3d. to 6s. 3d. on each £ of taxable income. Provision is made for personal, married, dependent children and widows’ allowances. Companies other than non-Fijian shipping companies are liable for tax at the rate of 6s. 3d. in the £ on profits. Non-Fijian shipping companies are taxed at the rate of 4½d. in the £.



Surtax is chargeable on individual incomes at varying rates. Death and gift duties are also payable.



**Public Finance**



| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

|------|------------|-----------------|

| 1959 | 7,160,202  | 6,516,687       |

| 1960 | 7,411,115  | 7,052,874       |

| 1961 | 7,445,265  | 7,412,694       |

| 1962 | 8,090,016  | 8,043,167       |

| 1963 | 9,291,805  | 8,611,613       |



In 1963 £7,103,000 of total revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, licences, income tax and other direct taxation. The main heads of expenditure were:



- Public Works Annually Recurrent £1,279,992;

- Medical 955,248*; Education £1,267,174*.



* Including personal emoluments.



**Currency**



Fiji currency notes are issued by the Fiji Currency Commission in denominations of £20, £10, £5, £1, 10s. and 5s.; silver coins in denominations of 2s., 1s., and 6d.; and smaller denominations of 3d., 1d. and ½d. The Fiji £ is linked to sterling at the rate of £F.111 — £100.



**Development Plans**



A Development Plan covering the period 1964–68 has been drawn up within an overall planning limit of £F.15m. The sector allocations within this limit are:



| Sector                  | Amount (£) |

|-------------------------|------------|

| Planning, Survey, Census| 250,000    |

| Communications           | 3,000,000  |

| Economics                | 6,500,000  |

| Social                   | 3,500,000  |

| Miscellaneous            | 1,750,000  |

| **Total**                | **£F.15,000,000** |



**Other Development**



During 1951 at the request of various Fijian Provincial Councils, a Fijian Development Fund was established into which is paid an amount not exceeding £10 a ton from the proceeds of the sale of Fijian-produced copra. Such deposits are credited to the producing group or individual and bear interest at 2%. The money thus accumulated may be expended only on works or schemes which will benefit the Fijians. The fund is administered by the Fijian Development Fund Board and is being used to provide funds for housing, water supplies, schools, domestic appliances, etc.



**Education**



At the end of the school year 1963 there were 91,868 pupils enrolled in schools, 7,281 of them in post-primary institutions. Both primary and post-primary education was carried on by missions, private bodies and Government. The roll of the Government Training College for Teachers was 222; of the Roman Catholic Training College, 17, and that of the Teacher Training Department of Fulton Missionary College, 29.



There were 578 registered schools where staffing and accommodation were satisfactory and 72 “recognised” schools of a lower standard.



In 1963 there were 2,891 teachers of whom 2,320 were registered. 2,145 of these registered teachers were in Government service.



The number of students studying abroad under scholarship and bursary schemes was 146:



- United Kingdom .. .. 16

- New Zealand .. .. 48

- Australia .. .. 48

- India .. .. 20

- Hawaii .. .. 10

- Canada .. .. 2

- Pakistan .. .. 2



146



During 1963 estimated gross expenditure on education from general revenue amounted to £1,321,236 compared with £43,306 in 1935. When local contributions by school authorities and expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds are taken into account, total expenditure on education during 1963 is estimated to have exceeded £1,700,000.



**Libraries and Museums**



The Fiji Museum at Suva contains a fine historical and ethnological collection relating to Fiji and Western Pacific Territories. The Carnegie Library and British Council Library at Suva and the Shri Ramkrishna Library at Nandi are the main lending and reference libraries in the Colony. The Fiji Society is concerned with subjects of historic, scientific and antiquarian interest to Fiji.



**Health**



The principal infectious diseases in Fiji are: influenza, pertussis, infantile diarrhoea and pulmonary tuberculosis. Malaria does not occur. The total bed capacity of hospitals in the Colony is 1,969, of which 1,925 are in Government institutions; there are also 46 dispensaries in the rural areas in charge of Assistant Medical Officers. Admissions to Government Hospitals in 1963 numbered about 28,915 and the number of out-patients, including those treated at dispensaries, was 690,452. Leprosy is treated at the Fiji Leprosy Hospital, Makogai, with the most modern methods.



The Fiji School of Medicine (formerly the Central Medical School), founded in 1888, provides a five-year course in medicine and a three-year course in dentistry, together with shorter ancillary courses. In 1963 158 students from 16 territories enrolled in these courses.

The actual expenditure from general revenue on medical services in 1963, inclusive of expenditure on Pacific Medical services, such as the Fiji School of Medicine and the Fiji Leprosy Hospital, Makogai, was £1,069,849 compared with £78,052 in 1935.



Communications



The Colony's main airport is the international airport at Nandi, 135 miles by road from Suva. Aircraft on the trans-Pacific route from Canada and the United States to Australia and New Zealand call at Nandi on both northbound and southbound flights. Services on these routes are operated by Canadian Pacific Airlines, Pan American World Airways and Qantas. Qantas operate a seven times weekly service in each direction. During 1963 Overseas aircraft arriving in Fiji numbered 1,910. Tasman Empire Airways with Electra aircraft operated a six times weekly service between Nandi and New Zealand.



The Compagnie de Transport Aeriens Intercontinentaux operate a twice weekly service from Paris to New Caledonia and Tahiti via Nandi Airport.



Services within Fiji and to neighbouring territories are operated by Fiji Airways with a fleet of five D.H. Heron, one D.H. Drover and one Piper aircraft based at Nausori (Suva) Airport. There are scheduled services to Nandi and the islands of Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Ovalan; and to Tonga, New Hebrides, the British Solomon Islands and Western Samoa. Nausori Airport has been made suitable for larger aircraft of the Herald and Fokke Friendship types requiring 6,000 feet of runway.



There are 440 miles of permanent line on the light railway operated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for bringing sugar cane to the crushing mills. The average annual tonnage transported is about 980,000. A free passenger service is run twice weekly on a section of track 120 miles long. The Colony is also served by a widespread and efficient Bus Transport System. There were 430 buses, 1,100 taxis and 10,000 other vehicles of all types.



There are some 1,260 miles of road, 1,003 miles of which have an all-weather surface.



The chief ports are Suva and Lautoka. Overseas vessels calling at Fiji ports during 1963 numbered 423, the majority being cargo vessels some of which also carry passengers. A monthly passenger and cargo service is maintained by the Union Steam Ship Company and connects Suva with Auckland, Tonga and Western Samoa. There is a monthly cargo service from the United Kingdom to New Zealand calling at Suva. Regular inter-island cargo, passenger and mail services are maintained by a small number of motor vessels and there are numerous craft up to about 120 tons operating on irregular itineraries to and from the main centres.



At the end of 1963, there were 138 post offices and agencies, 19 telephone exchanges, and 70 telegraph offices operated by the Posts and Telegraphs Department. Telephone and telegraph facilities are available between the principal towns on the main islands of Viti Levu, and Levuka on the island of Ovalau, with 9,400 telephone subscribers.



Radio-phone and telegraph services are maintained to 71 fixed shore stations, mainly on individual islands throughout the group, and Suva Post Office radio (VRO) operates a 24-hour watch for both fixed shore and ship stations. External telegraph and telephone communications are provided and operated by Cable and Wireless Ltd. to all important overseas countries.



Broadcasting



A broadcasting service is undertaken by the Fiji Broadcasting Commission on the following frequencies—VRH, 2 kW. on 930 kcs; VRH2, 500 w. on 840 kcs; VRH3, 2½ kW. on 890 kcs; VRH4, 10 kW. on 4·756 mcs. in the 60-metre band; VRH5, 500 w. on 4·785 mcs. in the 60-metre band; VRH5, 10 kW. on 4·785 m. in the 60-metre band; VRH8, 10 kW. on 3·230 mcs. in the 90-metre band; and VRH9, 10 kW., 3·346 mcs. 90-metre band.



VRH3, which not only serves the Lautoka area, but also the island of Vanua Levu, was opened at Lautoka in December 1956. The programmes from Suva are relayed by a very high frequency radio link. At the end of 1963, there were 27,982 licensed radio receivers.



Principal Occupations



The economy of the Colony is based on agriculture and to a smaller extent on mining. The cultivation of sugar cane is almost entirely in the hands of Indian peasant farmers. Fijians produce about three-fifths of the second important export crop, copra, and about 70% of the employees at the mines are Fijians. The bulk of the population is not, however, a wage-earning one.



At the end of 1963 there were 60 registered Industrial Associations.



Main Crops and Products



Mining is the only substantial non-agricultural industry and the Colony is otherwise wholly dependent upon primary production plus associated industries for coconut oil extraction and processing, cigarette manufacture and butter manufacture. Export income is secured from the sugar industry, from gold and manganese mining and from copra and bananas. Almost the whole of the gold and silver output is produced at Vatukoula, where 1,701 persons were employed in 1963. Production was 107,262 ozs. gold and 46,870 ozs. silver. There were 7 manganese mines in production during that year, the total output being 3,233 tons. Copper production totalled 30 tons and iron ore 1,063 tons.



Production for local consumption only, which normally closely approaches local needs, includes rice, root crops, such as taro, yams and cassava; fish and livestock products including whole milk and butter, beef, pork, goat flesh and eggs, and miscellaneous fruits and pulses.



The livestock population is estimated at: horses 16,164; cattle 112,986; pigs 22,000; goats 24,000; poultry 170,000.



Timber plantation formation continued on a limited scale with some 1,935 acres planted during 1963 mainly with pines and mahogany; this represents a 300% increase over the 1960 programme; a 24% increase over 1962. Considerable experimental work is being carried out in the satisfactory establishment of plantations. Four large long-term concessions are operating over some 120,000 acres. 43 sawmills were in operation during the year and timber production during 1963 was 14·3 million super feet, compared with the previous record production figure of 12·3 million in 1962. A steady changeover to other sources of fuel continues, particularly in the larger centres.

Reef and coastal fishing is undertaken in a small way by Fijians and Indians but the supply of local fish does not nearly meet the demand.



A geological survey is being undertaken to determine in detail the areas of possible economic mineralization. Upon completion a geological map of the Colony will be issued. The cost of the survey is being met from Colonial Development and Welfare and local funds.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations



At the close of 1963 there were 132 registered co-operative societies (1 Chinese, 2 Ellice Islanders, 64 Fijian, 3 Gilbertese, 38 Indian, 19 Multi-racial and 5 Rotuman). 49 probationary co-operative societies and groups were also operating under the guidance and supervision of the Co-operative Societies Department. By type the registered societies comprised 4 agricultural machinery, 25 consumers, 37 consumer-marketing, 8 marketing, 39 credit, 10 landholding, 1 agricultural colonization, 1 better living, 1 transport, 2 multi-purposes unions and 1 landholding union. Probationary societies by types comprised 1 consumers, and 48 consumer marketing. The total membership of the registered societies was 5,249 persons and 51 societies and their total subscribed capital was £78,801. The total membership of the probationary societies was 21,88 and their total subscribed capital was £24,047. The total turnover of registered and probationary societies in copra, other produce marketed and sales of consumer goods amounted to £801,711. The principal crop handled was copra, and the greater part of it was sold to local crushing mills. Sugar cane, which is not handled by co-operatives societies, is sold to South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd. The export of bananas is controlled by the Banana Marketing Board which issues licences to various shippers including the former licensed buyers, individual growers, co-operative societies and Fijian village organisations.
