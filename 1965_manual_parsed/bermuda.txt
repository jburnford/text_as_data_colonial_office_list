**BERMUDA**



**Situation and Area**



The "Bermudas" or "Somers Islands" are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 570 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, and until 1940 had an area of 19·34 square miles. As a result of work done by the United States authorities since 1940 to unite and extend some of the islands with materials dredged from the sea, their total area is now 20·59 square miles, of which 2·30 square miles are leased to the Government of the United States for naval and military bases, leaving 18·29 square miles available to the civil population. The United States Bases include a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.



**Population**



The estimated civil population on the 31st December 1963 was 47,230, of whom 17,084 were white and 30,146 coloured.



**Principal Towns**



The City of Hamilton, the capital since 1815, with a population estimated at about 2,800, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at about 1,800.



**Geographical Features**



The Bermudas consist of about 150 coralstone islands and islets, roughly in the form of a fishhook, along the southern rim of the oval plateau summit, about 22 miles from east to west and 14 miles from north to south, of a steep submarine volcanic mountain which is reputed to be between 14,000 and 15,000 feet in height. The ten principal islands are connected by bridges and form a chain about 22 miles long between its north-east and south-west extremities. These islands vary in width but the main island, which is about 14 miles long, has an average width of about 1 mile; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 259·4 feet above the sea. All the other islands and the areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,240 acres.



**Climate**



The climate is generally mild and humid with a mean annual temperature of 70° F. and average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of

90° F. and 47° F. respectively. The coldest and hottest months are February and August with mean temperatures of 62° F. and 80° F. respectively. The average annual rainfall is 58·1 inches. The climate shows very little variation throughout the Colony.



**History**



According to a 17th century French cartographer the islands were probably discovered in 1503 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers' ship *The Sea Venture* was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion and this extension was granted by King James I, in 1612 and the first emigrants went out in that year. Shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands", and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name. In 1684 the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled and government passed to the Crown.



**Constitution**



Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620. Since 1684 the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature. Until 1888 this legislature consisted of the Governor and the House of Assembly and since then of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.



The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of three official members (Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer and the Attorney General), and six unofficial members (increased from five in November, 1962) appointed by the Crown.



The Legislative Council consists of three official members (The Chief Justice as President, the Colonial Secretary and the Attorney General) and eight nominated members.



The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members elected for a term of five years. On the 12th January, 1963 a new Bill entitled *The Parliamentary Election Act, 1963*, received the assent of His Excellency. Under the provisions of this Act the nine parishes, which have always been represented by four members, have now been divided into two electoral districts, each of which will now be represented by two members. The new Act requires that voters must be British Subjects of twenty-five years of age or over at the time of registration, and if not possessing Bermudian status, they must have been ordinarily resident in the Colony for the whole of the period of three years immediately prior to registration, registration being held every year. Candidates for election must qualify as electors and, in addition, must possess Bermudian status. Electors who own the freehold estate in land in Bermuda of an area of not less than 2,000 square feet will now qualify for an additional vote. Formerly the franchise had been limited to those persons possessing freehold property of not less than £60 in value and, prior to 1944, only males were permitted to vote or to seek election.



At the General Election held on the 16th May 1963 86·5% of the registered electors voted. The Progressive Labour Party, the first political party to emerge in Bermuda, was successful in getting six of its nine candidates elected.



Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils and of the House of Assembly are paid 24s. for each day's attendance.



A number of Government Departments are controlled by Executive Boards which consist of unofficials appointed by the Governor. The head of the Department acts in an advisory capacity. The chairmen of most of the major Boards are members of the House of Assembly.



**Taxation**



There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 16s. on every £100 of real estate and personal property. The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

Development



Agriculture.—The ever increasing density of the population and the corresponding increase in housing to accommodate it continued to encroach on the land available for agriculture which, in 1963, was a mere 1,037 acres.



The re-afforestation scheme, started in 1949 with the object of replacing the dead Bermuda cedars, continued with some 12,500 trees being felled and trees, shrubs and palms being planted in their place.



The Parks Division, formed in 1956, continued to care for the many small wayside parks bordering public roads, gardens, school playing fields and grounds, Government House Grounds and the Botanical Gardens, in all comprising some 295 acres.



Public Works



1963 and 1964 were both extremely busy years for the Department and the following is a brief summary of the work carried out:



Buildings.—Work on the construction of the new wing of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital continued and was 95% complete at the end of 1964. The wing comprises 5 double corridor type nursing units giving 170 beds together with ancillary services, viz.: operating suite, central supply, radiology, pathology and emergency departments. The total cost of the project will be approximately £1,500,000.



Work on the erection of an extension to the nurses’ residence to provide an additional 16 bedrooms was completed in December 1963.



An extensive school building and maintenance programme valued at £400,000 was pursued, and other work of a varied nature was carried out at the Civil Air Terminal and on government offices.



Aerial Survey.—In 1962 approval was given for a new Survey of Bermuda to be undertaken at an estimated cost of £35,000 of which £20,000 is to be met from United Kingdom resources. Aerial photography was carried out in July 1962, and during 1963 the Survey Department was actively engaged in field work. The Directorate of Overseas Surveys, Tolworth, Surrey, are plotting the new maps from the aerial photographs as controlled by the field work and the preliminary maps are expected in 1965.



Bridges.—The old swing bridge at St. George’s was permanently closed to road traffic in June 1963, prior to dismantling in October, and work commenced in December on the construction of a new bridge. The new bridge was officially opened in July 1964, has six approach spans (supported on the previous piers which have been raised) and a 127 foot long swing span. The carriageway is 20 feet wide and narrow footpaths have been provided on each side. The total cost of the project was £86,000.



Sea Water Distillation Scheme.—In 1963 the Legislature appropriated a sum of £120,000 for the construction of a water distillation plant capable of providing 130,000 Imperial gallons per day to meet the water supply needs of the extended Hospital and to serve the Community in general in times of drought. The plant was scheduled for commissioning in the latter half of 1964.



Education



| Type of School | Primary Enrolment No. | Secondary Enrolment No. | Technical and Vocation Enrolment No. |

|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|

| Government Schools | 22 6,488 | — | — |

| Schools receiving aid from Government (not included above) | 5 801 | 11 1,988 | 7 318 |

| Unaided Schools | 30 1,686 | 4 326 | 1 64 |

| Totals | 57 8,975 | 15 2,314 | 8 382 |



There are no post-secondary schools.



Departmental expenditure on Education was £822,226 and Public Works expenditure £259,563. Total expenditure on Education was £1,081,789 representing 17·1% of the total Government expenditure as compared with 12·8% in 1962.



Libraries, Museums, etc.



The Bermuda Library, with adult, children’s and music departments in Hamilton, was greatly enlarged during 1957 and now accommodates the interesting collection of the Bermuda Historical Society. It has branches in St. George’s and Somerset and a distribution service to the schools of the Colony.



The Bermuda Government Aquarium with adjoining live zoological collection, which was also considerably enlarged and much improved, has a museum of local natural history and other exhibits. The Bermuda Historical Society has a second museum in St. George containing items of local historical interest.



Health



The level of health in the Colony continued to be high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.



The King Edward VII Memorial Hospital is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1964 to £300,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. On the 1st October 1960, a Health Insurance Scheme for Government employees and their dependants was inaugurated. The scheme is compulsory for Government employees and optional for their dependants. Contributions are at the rate of £5 2s. 0d. per annum for an officer only, £10 4s. 0d. per annum for an officer and one dependant and £15 12s. 0d. for an officer and two or more dependants. The Government contributes equal amounts into the fund.



During 1963 total government expenditure on Health Services was £412,442 compared with approximately £41,000 in 1937.



Communications



The air terminal is at Kindley Field, St. George’s Island.

Five airlines, i.e. B.O.A.C.-Cunard, P.A.A., Eastern, T.C.A. and Iberia, provide Bermuda with scheduled services to Britain, Spain, Canada, the United States, the Bahamas, the Caribbean and West Indies, and South America.



Direct and indirect seaborne passenger and cargo services are maintained with varying frequency and regularity with all parts of the world by Bermuda Shipping Company, Booth-Lamport, Cunard, Furness-Bermuda, Holland-America, Independent Golf, Isbrandsten, MANZ, Pacific and Oriental, Pacific Steamship Navigation, Royal Mail and Saguenay.



The Colony has 132 miles of well surfaced roads with 8½ miles in Hamilton and 4½ miles in St. George's. On the 31st January 1964, there were 20,605 vehicles licensed in the Colony comprising 6,999 private cars, 593 taxis and buses, 1,157 motor trucks, 11,302 auto and auxiliary cycles and 554 miscellaneous vehicles.



There is no railway in Bermuda.



Broadcasting



There are two broadcasting stations, both commercial, one operated by the Bermuda Broadcasting Company Limited, using the call sign Z.B.M., the other operated by Capital Broadcasting Company Limited, using the call sign Z.F.D.



The first named company was formed in 1943 and started broadcasting in 1946 on 1240 kc/s with a power output of 250 watts. In 1953 a second station, Z.M.B.2 was added to the network and in 1962 power on both stations was increased to 1,000 watts and an F.M. station Z.B.M.-F.M. was inaugurated.



The Company have also operated since January 1958, a television service known as Z.B.M.-T.V.



The latter named company was formed in 1962 and commenced broadcasting the same year with a power output of 1,000 watts.



Neither radio nor T.V. receiving licences are required.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations



The only marketing scheme in operation in Bermuda is the "Planned Production and Marketing Scheme" introduced in 1949 to assist the growers of vegetables to find a suitable outlet for their produce. The growers taking part in the scheme contract to grow a specified acreage of certain vegetable crops. The Department of Agriculture agrees to purchase any produce from the acreage specified at guaranteed minimum prices. In addition to the produce grown on contract the Government Wholesale Agricultural Marketing Centre buys other vegetables, citrus fruit and bananas. This scheme has undoubtedly assisted the farming community as more farmers are applying to join. During 1963 purchases of agricultural produce at the Wholesale Marketing Centre amounted to £48,589. Receipts from the resale of this produce were nearly £45,103.
