BRITISH HONDURAS



Area

British Honduras lies on the Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and by Guatemala in the remainder of the west and south. Its land area is about 8,866 square miles, which includes a number of islets, known as "cayes", lying off the coast.



Population

The estimated population at the end of 1963 was 103,104. At the census taken in April 1960 the de facto total population was 90,019. The main racial groups are: Creoles, American Indians (Maya) and Caribs. There are also a number of persons of East Indian and Spanish descent. The

races are, however, now heavily inter-mixed and a great many persons would have considerable difficulty in deciding to which group they belong.



English is the official language and the language taught in the schools. Spanish is also in common use, chiefly by the Indians, whose language it is tending to replace. The term Creole is now commonly used to denote local negroes and persons of negro extraction; it is also used in respect of persons of mixed Spanish and Indian descent.

Geographical Features



The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, form the backbone of the southern half of the Colony. All of the western (Cayo) District is hilly and includes the Mountain Pine Ridge most of which lies between 1,000 and 2,000 feet above sea level but rises in parts to around 3,000 feet. The northern districts are also hilly except towards the coast but contain considerable areas of low tableland. There are seventeen principal rivers, of which the Belize River is the most important. None is navigable by vessels over five feet draught and few for any notable distance. An estimated 92% of the mainland is under forest.



Climate



The climate is sub-tropical and on the whole agreeable to non-tropical peoples. In the capital, Belize City, the temperature range during the year is 50° to 96° with an average mean of 78° 5°. Most of the year the heat and humidity are tempered by sea breezes. This description applies with small variation along the whole coastal area. Inland the day temperatures, during the dry season, tend to be higher, up to 100°, but drop considerably at night. Rainfall increases from north to south:



| Annual average Inches |

|-----------------------|

| Corozal (north)       | 51         |

| Belize City (central) | 63         |

| El Cayo (western central) | 52   |

| Stann Creek (upper south) | 147 |

| Toledo (south)        | 175        |



There are two dry seasons, the main one from March to May and the other in August and September (called the Maugre Season).



The Colony has been struck from time to time by hurricanes.



In recent years:

- a hurricane struck Belize City on the 10th September 1931 causing heavy loss of life and property;

- on the 27th September 1955 Hurricane "Janet" struck the northern part of the country completely destroying the town of Corozal and damaging dozens of villages in the Orange Walk District. Damage was estimated at over $4 million. The United Kingdom Government gave assistance totalling $3,480,000—$800,000 of this being a loan and the rest a free grant;

- on the 15th July 1960 Hurricane "Abby" struck the area of the Sittee River, south of Stann Creek, causing some damage to crops and dwellings;

- on the 24th July 1961 Hurricane "Anna" wrought fairly extensive damage to crops and houses in the villages of Seine Bight and Placencia and Sittee River and almost completely destroyed banana plantations at Waha Leaf in the Stann Creek District;

- on the 31st October 1961 Hurricane "Hattie" caused 262 deaths and most serious damage to Belize City, Stann Creek and other parts of the country.



History



The present Settlement was apparently established in 1638 but British sea rovers were frequenting the Bay from long before that year and there is some evidence that a Settlement was formed in or around 1603. Logwood was the attraction, and the 1638 Settlement was augmented from time to time by sea rovers and—notably after the capture of Jamaica by British forces in 1655—by disbanded British soldiers and sailors. In the Treaty of Madrid, 1670, Spain recognized Britain's sovereignty over the Bay Settlement.



Concurrently another and larger British Settlement was building up on the Moskito Indian Coast, far to the south of British Honduras. Modern historians frequently confuse the two Settlements; but although they assisted each other on occasion, they were entirely separate organizations with quite different forms of government. The Moskito Indians stubbornly and successfully resisted Spanish intrusion but welcomed and became loyal allies of the British settlers. The Moskito Coast settlers were known as the Shoremen and the Bay settlers as the Baymen. In 1786 Britain handed over the Moskito Coast to Spain in return for a small and comparatively worthless strip of land contiguous to the Bay Settlement. Some of the Shoremen moved to Jamaica and the rest were compulsorily evacuated to the strip, where they became merged with the Baymen.



The Bay Settlement was a piece of purely British pioneering. The Spaniards found plentiful supplies of logwood, and Indians for slaves, in Northern Yucatan and settled there. Southern Yucatan, on the other hand, was by then practically devoid of Indians and its littoral was a wilderness of mosquito-infested mangrove swamps guarded by lee-shore reefs and tricky channels. The Spaniards therefore left this coast alone until the British began to settle around the mouth of the Belize River. The export of logwood from the Bay Settlement broke the highly profitable Spanish monopoly, brought great prosperity to Britain's wool and cloth-dyeing trades and caused Spain to launch attack after attack on the Settlement in an effort to drive out her competitors.



This armed aggression continued until 1798, when the Spaniards invaded the Settlement in strong naval and military force. The Baymen, although badly under-armed and heavily outnumbered, resisted and, after several days of skirmishing, the forces met in sea battle off St. George's Cay. Supported by H.M. Sloop Merlin, the Baymen fought with such determination that the Spaniards were forced to retreat. This was Spain's last attempt to dislodge the Baymen by force of arms.



Until 1786 the Baymen governed themselves. In that year, after many petitions from the

Baymen, England appointed and sent out a Superintendent, but the office was allowed to lapse in 1791. In 1797 Colonel Thomas Barrow was appointed Superintendent and was also given the title of Commander-in-Chief (held by the Governors of the Colony ever since) to enable him to organize the defence against the obviously impending Spanish attack. Thereafter the office of Superintendent continued until 1862, when it was replaced by that of Lieutenant-Governor, under the Governor of Jamaica and the Settlement raised to the status of a Colony. The Baymen resented being subordinated to Jamaica and in 1884 the Colony was detached from Jamaica and given a Governor.



**Constitution**



In 1954 the Legislative Council was replaced by a Legislative Assembly composed of nine elected members, three *ex officio* members and a Speaker and three unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The status of the Executive Council was changed to that of chief instrument of policy and it was composed of the Governor, as Chairman, three *ex officio* members and six members of the Legislative Assembly. The latter were elected by the Assembly but included not less than two of the nominated unofficial members of that body. Universal adult suffrage was also introduced in 1954, and the first general election under the new Constitution was held on 28th April 1954. The only fully organized party, the Peoples' United Party, gained eight of the nine elected seats. The principle of Steering Members, appointed by the Governor from among the unofficial members of the Executive Council, as the first step towards full ministerial status, was adopted in 1955.



At the general elections which took place on the 20th March 1957 the People's United Party gained all nine of the elected seats.



In February 1960 a Conference was convened in London by H.M. Government to consider *inter alia* proposals for the development of the Constitution of British Honduras. This conference was attended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State with their Advisers; the Governor of British Honduras and official and unofficial members of the Government; and the leaders of the political parties in the territory.



The Conference decided to adopt a ministerial form of Government based on a revised Legislative Assembly and Executive Council. This revised Constitution was introduced in March 1961 following a general election. The new Legislative Assembly presided over by a Speaker, consisted of 18 members elected by the general public, five nominated members and two *ex-officio* members (the Chief Secretary (formerly known as the Colonial Secretary) and the Attorney General). The normal life of the Assembly was four years. The revised Executive Council under the chairmanship of the Governor, consisted of two *ex-officio* members (the Chief Secretary, responsible *inter alia* for defence, security and external affairs, and the Attorney General) and six unofficial members holding various departmental portfolios as Ministers, of whom at least one was a nominated member of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the political party obtaining a majority at a general election for the Legislative Assembly seats was appointed First Minister and the remaining five unofficial members of the Executive Council were elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Assembly from among their own number. As regards the five nominated members of the Legislative Assembly, these were filled by the Governor, after consultation with the First Minister in respect of two seats and after consultation with the leader of the minority party in respect of one seat, the remaining two seats being filled by the Governor after consultation with the leaders of both the majority and minority parties. Further details are set out in a White Paper issued by H.M. Government as Cmdn. 984.



At the general election held in March 1961, the People's United Party, led by Mr. George Price, won all the 18 elected seats in the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Price was thereupon appointed First Minister and his Ministry has since held office.



The former post of Financial Secretary was replaced by that of Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, a Ministry which is in the portfolio of the First Minister.



At a Constitutional Conference held in London in July 1963, it was agreed that the Colony should have a Ministerial system of internal self-government with a two-chamber legislature. Under the new Constitution which was introduced on the 6th January 1964, the Governor has special responsibilities for defence, external affairs, internal security and the safeguarding of the terms and conditions of service of public officers. Further, for so long as the Government of British Honduras continues to receive moneys from the United Kingdom Government in the form of grant-in-aid of the current revenues the Governor has a special responsibility for maintaining or securing the financial and economic stability of British Honduras and for ensuring that any condition attached to any financial grant or loan made by Her Majesty's Government is complied with.



The Executive Council has been replaced by a Cabinet consisting of a Premier and other Ministers. Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears to him to be likely to command the support of the majority party in the House of Representatives.



The bicameral Legislature is known as the National Assembly and comprises a House of Representatives and a Senate.



The House of Representatives consists of 18 members elected under the system of universal adult suffrage. The Speaker may be elected by the House from amongst its own number or from outside the House but the Deputy Speaker is elected by the House from amongst its own number.



The Senate, which will come into existence after the next general election, will consist of 8 members appointed by the Governor. He will appoint 5 on the advice of the Premier, 2 on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and 1 after consulting such persons as he considers appropriate. The President will be elected by the Senate from amongst its own number or from outside the Senate but the Vice-President will be elected by the Senate from amongst its own number.



**Land Policy**



The alienation of Crown land is carefully controlled to prevent, as far as possible, the acquisition of such land for purely speculative, non-productive purposes. No racial discrimination is exercised.



During 1953 and 1954 a land use survey was carried out. A land policy, based on the findings and recommendations of the Survey Team, has been formulated and was published by Government in 1958.

Taxation



Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 45% on all income over $25,000. Surtax is levied on the first $2,000 in excess of $8,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 15%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 20%; and on the remainder at 25%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $600, plus allowances for wife, children, dependent relatives, life assurance premiums, earned income and gifts to charity. The rate of tax on companies is 40% of the chargeable income of the company.



Public Finance (see also section immediately below)



| Revenue | Expenditure |

|---------|-------------|

| $       | $           |

| 1959    | 10,372,233  | 10,401,433 |

| 1960    | 8,947,958   | 9,795,852  |

| 1961    | 10,450,525  | 9,044,140  |

| 1962    | 12,011,351  | 13,293,958 |

| 1963    | 15,546,263* | 17,219,056*|



*Estimates.



In 1963 $4,216,662 of the true revenue was derived from Customs duties and charges and $2,842,940 from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:



General Administration $2,566,000, Economic Services $3,764,000, other services including Hurricane Rehabilitation $7,819,000.



The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1963 amounted to $4,519,847. Sinking funds on hand amounted to $1,284,115, leaving $3,235,732 as the net outstanding debt.



Financial Assistance towards Reconstruction after Hurricane "Hattie" (1961)



In May 1962 the Secretary of State announced that, subject to the approval of Parliament, Her Majesty's Government had decided to make available to the Government of British Honduras aid totalling approximately £5 million. Of this amount about £1 million had already been incurred on emergency assistance immediately following the hurricane. Of the balance of £4 million, which would be spread over four years, £2½ million would be towards the general programme of reconstruction, and £1½ million towards the cost of building a new capital, subject to the approval of a satisfactory plan. If during the four-year period it appeared that further funds would be required for reconstruction, Her Majesty's Government would consider making an additional contribution of up to £750,000.



(Note.—Although severe damage was done to Belize City, on the low sea-coast, by Hurricane "Hattie", it was not by any means damaged beyond repair. The building of a new capital inland is being contemplated, however, because it may be preferable for the capital, in future, to be in an area less vulnerable to hurricane damage.)



Currency



The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 are issued and there are coins of 50, 25 and 10 cents pieces in cupro nickel, 5 cents in nickel/brass and bronze 1 cent pieces.



Development Plans



In addition to almost $25 million contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds during the period 1945-1965, a further allocation of $4·8 million was made to this country under the Commonwealth Development Act, 1963 for the period up to the 31st March 1966. The major portion of the funds will be used to make a start with the implementation of some of the "grant" worthy projects in the British Honduras Government's new seven-year Development Plan which, based on the United Nations Economic Survey Mission's report on the country, was placed before the Legislative Assembly in December 1963. It envisages a total expenditure of about $48 million; of this sum it is proposed that about $18 million should be financed by loan, a small part of which is to be raised locally. The main items in the Plan comprise:



| Millions | $ |

|----------|---|

| Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry and Lands and Surveys | 7·6 |

| Communications | 16·0 |

| Education and Training | 8·2 |

| Housing | 8·4 |

| Medical and Health | 1·6 |

| Water and Sewerage | 4·0 |



A Development Finance Corporation has recently been established under the provisions of the Development Corporation Ordinance No. 2 of 1961 as amended by Ordinance No. 15 of 1963. The purpose of the Corporation is to expand and strengthen the economy of the country. The share capital of the Corporation is $4 million divided into 400,000 shares at $10 a share. There are at present 2,636 shareholders holding 31,855 shares.



The Reconstruction and Development Corporation which was set up to manage certain funds allocated to the general reconstruction programme and to secure the laying out of and the development of new towns, was very active in 1963. It approved grants and loans for housing rehabilitation to the value of over $1 million. Loan funds amounting to approximately $40,000 were also provided for citrus and cocoa growers, fishermen and tradesmen.



Other Development



Tate and Lyle Ltd. has taken over the Corozal Sugar Factory Ltd. and its subsidiaries. The Corozal Sugar Factory Ltd. produced 33,500 tons of sugar in 1964 for the domestic and export market. Tate and Lyle Ltd. intends to expand the existing operations of the present factory to 45,000 tons and to erect another factory in the Orange Walk district to produce a further 30,000 tons of sugar by 1967. The total estimated investment is $31 million.



United Fruit Co. Ltd., the parent Company of locally incorporated Belize Banana Company, has signed an agreement with Government to investigate the establishment of operations in the Swasey-Bladen-Monkey River Area which will involve the growing and processing of bananas and other agricultural crops and the bye products from such crops for sale in world markets. The estimated investment is $13 million.



Two firms, Hercules B. H. Ltd. and Pine Harvestors Ltd., have invested some $5 million in a project to produce resin from pine stumps. The plant which is situated at Big Creek, Independence in the Stann Creek District has been completed and operations commenced.



Salada Foods Inc. have acquired the Commonwealth Development Corporation holdings in the Stann Creek Valley and propose to plant out extensive acreages of citrus. It has established a plant for the production of frozen concentrates for

the Canadian market. The Citrus orchards in the Stann Creek Valley, recovered quickly from the severe damage done by Hurricane "Hattie".



Education



Primary education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. It is conducted almost entirely by the denominations, with a government subsidy. Similarly, with the exception of a Government Technical College, the secondary schools are all run by the denominations.



The Minister of Education is responsible for education under the general authority of the Education Ordinance, 1962. His Chief Executive Officer is the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Education, and his Chief Administrative Officer is the Chief Education Officer. A Primary Education Board and an Advisory Council for Secondary and Further Education advise him on the respective branches of education.



In 1963 there were 133 primary grant-aided schools (of which 2 were maintained by Government), 27 private primary schools, 15 recognised denominational secondary schools and a Technical College run by the Government, as well as a special school for handicapped children conducted on a semi-private basis. The total enrolment in primary schools was approximately 26,500, and in secondary schools 2,300. There were two Teacher Training Colleges offering a two-year course, and an Intermediate Teacher Training Centre giving an intensive twenty-week course for new entrants to the teaching profession.



There is no local institution at university level, and scholarships are awarded to the University of the West Indies and universities and similar institutions in Britain and other countries. The University maintains an Extra Mural Department with a Resident Tutor in Belize City.



Expenditure on education from the local budget in 1963 was $1,161,525, representing about 12% of the budget. In addition C.D. & W. grants and Hurricane Rehabilitation grants and loans from the United Kingdom amounted to $612,884.



Libraries, etc.



A statutory Library Board conducts the British Honduras Library Service, which falls under the portfolio of the Minister of Education, Health and Housing. The Library Service aims at complete coverage of the country, and at the 30th June, 1964 had 62 service-points—a Central Library, a Children's Library, a Technical Library, a branch and two smaller points in Belize City, a branch in each of the five district towns, and 51 sub-libraries in villages throughout the country. The majority of the service-points have reading and reference sections. The service is a free one. At the end of 1963 there were 12,326 registered members, and the bookstock was 55,541 volumes.



The Central Library is accommodated in the Baron Bliss Institute, which also houses the Extra Mural Department of the University of the West Indies, and has a modern stage and auditorium. Evening classes are conducted regularly by the Extra Mural Department, and dramatic productions are held.



The British Council has an office and a Representative in Belize City.



Health



The country is relatively free from endemic diseases. Malaria, which was most prevalent, is no longer a problem, owing to a Malaria Eradication Programme operated on a tripartite basis by Government, W.H.O., and U.N.I.C.E.F. The main general hospital, with 162 beds, is in Belize City and there are small hospitals in each of the 5 districts, all run by Government, and with a total bed strength of 142. There is also a 13 bed private hospital in the capital. Some 20 Government and Mission rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse. A nurses training school and hostel was opened in new quarters in 1963.



Two Health Centres, a venereal disease unit, an infirmary and a mental hospital are maintained by Government in Belize City. A temporary tuberculosis sanatorium, also maintained by Government, has been established some 16 miles outside Belize City to replace the one destroyed in the 1961 hurricane.



Expenditure on medical and health services from general revenue during 1963 was $972,519.



Communications



The Belize International Airport, about ten miles north-west of Belize City, is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services are operated to the Colony by the following airlines:



- Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. International).

- Servicio Aereo de Honduras, S.A. (S.A.H.S.A.).

- Transportes Aereos Nacionales, S.A.(T.A.N.). Maya Airlines.



There are twice-weekly services to New Orleans (U.S.A.), Belize City and San Salvador via Guatemala City and return; Miami, Belize City and San Pedro Sula (Honduras) and return; San Pedro Sula, Puerto Barrios (Guatemala) and Belize City and return; and a thrice-weekly service between Belize City, Merida (Yucatan, Mexico) and San Pedro Sula (Honduras) and return. Maya Airways also operate an internal air service on schedule to district towns and to other parts of the Colony.



There are 500 miles of all-weather main and feeder roads and 1742 miles of cart roads and bush trails maintained by Government. Forty-three miles of new feeder roads have been built to serve the sugar cane industry in the Corozal district. An unknown, but considerable, mileage of dirt roads built by logging contractors and the Forest Department, public use of which is permitted, will take, for example, jeeps and landrovers, in the dry season.



The United Fruit Company maintains a weekly passenger and cargo service between Belize City and New Orleans. The T. and J. Harrison and the Royal Netherlands S.S. lines offer a regular fortnightly cargo service between Belize City and the United Kingdom and Europe respectively, the Royal Netherlands ships offering limited passenger accommodation. The Caribbean line operates an irregular service between New York and Belize City.



In 1961 a total of 35 steam and motor vessels and 28 sailing vessels, 1,200 gross tons in all, registered at the port of Belize City. The tonnage figures of shipping which entered the country in 1961 are not available as a result of loss of records during Hurricane "Hattie".



Telecommunications



Cable & Wireless Ltd. have been granted a licence to operate the external telecommunications

service of the country which also includes radio-telephone facilities with major towns and cities in the U.S.A., the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.



The Belize City telephone system has been taken over also by Cable & Wireless Ltd. and the company has installed a new system.



There is also an internal telecommunications system in operation.



**Information Service**



On 1st November 1962, Information and Broadcasting were separated and two new Departments formed. The Government Information Service is now in charge of all Government publicity material, press liaison, campaigns and exhibitions to project the activities and policies of the Government to the people at home and abroad.



**Broadcasting**



Government operates a radio broadcasting service (Radio Belize) transmitting from Belize City on the following frequencies and powers: 840 kc/s. (361 metres), 20kW. and 3·3 Mc/s. (90 metres), 5 kW. to 20 kW. Programmes are given in English and Spanish and include both local and foreign news, announcements of local interest, local features, transcribed music and plays. Daily time totals about eleven hours and the Station began broadcasting commercial advertisements on payment of a fee as from the 1st July, 1964.



**Principal Occupations**



Most of the working population are engaged in agriculture on their own account.



The estimated numbers engaged in the principal wage earning occupations at the end of 1962 were:



- Agriculture . . . . . . 2,244

- Manufacture and Repair . . . 2,115

- Forestry . . . . . . 1,067

- Personal services (hotel staff, electricians, etc.) . . . 301

- Commerce . . . . . . 600

- Building and Construction . . . 637

- Mining (Oil Exploration) . . . 87

- Printing . . . . . . 84

- Transport, Storage and Communications . . . . . . 1,865



Membership of trade unions totalled 4,800 (declared nominal membership) at the end of 1962. There are nine trade unions in the Colony.



**Main Crops and Products**



Indian corn (maize), beans and peas, rice, sugar, cassava and yams are the principal food crops of the Country. The main export crops are citrus fruits, processed citrus and sugar. Cattle, pigs and poultry are raised throughout the country. Sugar is the principal export product in the form of raw sugar and molasses. Timber is also a main export product. This consists mainly of mahogany, pine and cedar. Rosewood, Banak, Santa Maria and other woods are also exported. Efforts are being directed to building up the country's scale-fish industry, and an export trade to the United States, chiefly in lobsters, is well established.



Industries established in and near Belize City are a sawmill, a cigarette factory, two aluminium door, window and louvre factories, a garment factory and several small furniture factories. In other parts of the country there are canneries, two operating in the Stann Creek Valley on citrus products, a cement block and tile factory at the border of the Belize-Cayo Districts, a resin factory in Stann Creek District and in the Corozal District there is a large sugar factory.

*This is not a true presentation as certain import records for August, 1961, were destroyed by Hurricane "Hattie".



In 1938 19·1% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 12·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 68·0% from foreign countries. The corresponding figures for 1963 were: 26·08%, 13·99% and 59·93%.



In 1938 22·5% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 6·3% to other Commonwealth countries and 71·2% to foreign countries. The corresponding figures for 1963 were: 41·3%, 11·72% and 46·35%.



The chief imports are normally vehicles, motor spirits, machinery, cotton and artificial silk piece-goods, beans and peas, condensed, evaporated and powdered milk, flour, butter, margarine and lard substitutes. There are, of course, also likely to be special imports in the four-year reconstruction period (1962-66).

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations



The Marketing Board continued to offer fixed prices for rice, corn and red kidney beans. Purchases for the past two years amounted to:



| Year | Rice (lbs.) | Corn (lbs.) | R. K. Beans (lbs.) |

|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|

| 1962 | 1,967,423   | 20,316      | 373,544           |

| 1963 | 1,625,384   | 33,154      | 384,267           |



Because corn and bean production was low, the Board imported these commodities as well as rice to meet the shortfall.



At the end of 1963 there were 43 Credit Unions, one Consumer Co-operative, two Beekeepers Co-operatives, three Fishing Co-operatives, nine Housing Co-operatives, four Livestock Co-operatives, six Agricultural Producers Co-operatives and one Broom Makers Co-operative.



The total membership of co-operative societies including credit unions was 13,576 with an overall share capital of $1,466,510.



In addition there were 25 Junior and two Senior Savings Unions with a total savings of $2,206.
