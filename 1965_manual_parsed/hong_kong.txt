HONG KONG



Area



The area of land is approximately 398½ square miles (Hong Kong Island 29 square miles, Kowloon 3½ square miles, Stonecutters Island ½ square mile, New Territories (leased) 365½ square miles). It includes all islands within a rectangular area of some 738 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory. British waters are bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.



Population



The population of the Colony at the end of 1963 was 3,642,500. It is not practicable to divide these by race, but over 98% speak the Chinese language or have traditional connexions with China, though more than half are British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. At the 1961 Census, out of 3,129,648 residents including Service personnel and their families, only 49,747 gave their place of origin as outside Hong Kong and China; 33,140 of these were of Commonwealth and 16,607 of non-Commonwealth origin.



Principal Towns



The overwhelming majority of the population lives on Hong Kong Island or in Kowloon. The capital is Victoria, on Hong Kong Island.



The principal centres of population in the New Territories are Tsuen Wan, which has recently grown into an important industrial centre with large textile, enamel and rubber factories, iron works, etc.; Cheung Chau, a small but densely populated island, important as a market and fishing centre; Yuen Long, a mainland market town; Tai O, a fishing and market centre on Lantao Island; Tai Po and Shek Wu Hui, both mainland market towns; and Peng Chau, an island fishing port, with some industries.



Geographical Features



The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with 235 adjacent islands ranging from Lantao with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.



The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside, in some parts covered with dense scrub, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.



A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain—Tai Mo Shan, 3,140 feet; Lantao Peak is 3,061 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,805 feet high.



Climate



The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84·76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.



History



Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in

1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters Island in the harbour, Ap Lei Chau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.



The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.



**Constitution**



The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February 1917 by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of twelve officials and thirteen unofficials, nine of whom are Chinese and one Indian. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of six officials and 16 unofficials, eight of whom are elected.



**Land Policy**



All land is owned by the Crown. In the early days of the Colony, Crown leases were granted for 75, 99, or 999 years. Nowadays, except in the New Territories, they are granted for 75 years, renewable for a further 75 years at a reassessed Crown rent. Crown leases for New Territories lands are now normally granted for a period of 99 years, less three days, from 1st July 1898.



The Government's basic policy is to sell leases to the highest bidder at public auction or by tender. Land for special housing projects, for public utilities, schools, clinics, religious and approved charitable purposes is usually granted by private treaty.



**Taxation**



(1) **Earnings and Profits Tax.**—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:



(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).



(b) Salaries Tax.



(c) Interest Tax.



(d) Property Tax.



The standard rate for 1964–65 is $12\frac{1}{2}\%$ and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is normally only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries Tax is levied on net income from employment after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($7,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $5,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony other than in the New Territories. The rate of tax is one-half of the standard rate (i.e. $6\frac{1}{2}\%$) if the rent receivable is in fact controlled by reference to 1941 rental but at the full standard rate (i.e. $12\frac{1}{2}\%$) on all other properties. However, property wholly occupied by the owner exclusively for residential purposes is exempt from Property Tax.



Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax, as is the case under Salaries Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.



(2) **Estate Duty.**—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2% in the case of estates valued between $50,000 and $100,000, and 40% in the case of estates valued at over $15 million.



(3) **Other Sources of Revenue.**—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainments Tax, Betting Tax and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor and table waters.

| 1963–64        | 1,393,871,322 | 1,295,372,841 |



In 1963–64, $418,211,533 was raised from direct and indirect taxes, $225,494,014 from Duties and $144,775,102 from Rates. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:



- Public Works: $588,567,557

- Police: $77,152,417

- Subventions: $146,655,777

- Medical: $76,893,619



The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March 1964 amounted to $86,279,600 (approximately $23·37 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:



- $3\frac{1}{2}\%$ Dollar Loan (1940)—$944,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).

- $3\frac{1}{2}\%$ Rehabilitation Loan (1947–48)—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $22,648,505).

- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$269,600.

- U.K. Government Loan for Kai Tak Airport Development—$38,400,000.



**Currency**



The value of the Hong Kong dollar is maintained at approximately HK $1 = 1s. 3d. sterling.



The currency in circulation consists of $500 $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by three banks of issue: Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, The Chartered Bank and Mercantile Bank, Ltd. respectively. Subsidiary currency consisting of $1 and 1 cent notes and nickel alloy coins in denominations of $1, 50 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents are issued by the Hong Kong Government. The $1 note is gradually being withdrawn from circulation.

Development Plans



Over the next four years it is proposed to expend about $2,300 million on development projects, $200 million of which will be provided from the Colony's Development Loan Fund (mainly on housing), and the balance from general revenues.



The main items to be financed from revenue are as follows:



| Item                        | $    |

|-----------------------------|------|

| New Schools                 | 100  |

| New Hospitals and Clinics   | 100  |

| Public Amenities            | 40   |

| Piers and Reclamations      | 160  |

| Waterworks                  | 400  |

| Housing                     | 400  |



Note: Figures are subject to considerable change next year in the light of the next Five-Year Forecast of Estimates for 1965–66/1969–70.



Other Development



Shortage of land for housing and industry is a serious problem. Since 1946 the Government has reclaimed about 1,153 acres from the sea, including about 221 acres for Kwun Tong, an industrial town on the east shore of Kowloon Bay. Other potential new town sites in the New Territories are under investigation and work is in hand on a large reclamation project at Tsuen Wan/Kwai Chung.



One of Hong Kong's major problems has been to overcome a chronic shortage of water. A new reservoir with a storage capacity of 5,400 million gallons at Shek Pik on the island of Lantau was completed in 1963, making the total storage capacity now 16,800 million gallons. In April 1964, an Agreement was signed with the People's Council of the Kwangtung Province for the supply of at least 15,000 million gallons per year commencing in March 1965 from the East River. Work has commenced on converting an inlet at Plover Cove into a 30,000 million gallon reservoir which, when complete, will go a long way to satisfying the Colony's requirements. The first stage of the scheme should produce 20 million gallons a day in 1965.



Capital expenditure on public works and buildings undertaken by Government in 1963 was approximately:



| Item                        | Millions |

|-----------------------------|---------|

| Buildings                   | 224     |

| Civil Engineering           | 91      |

| (Roads, Drainage, Reclamations, etc.) |         |

| Waterworks                  | 116     |



Education



In 1964 education was provided in 2,184 schools for over 825,000 pupils. This figure represents approximately one in five of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:



- Primary: 586,000

- Secondary: 161,000

- Post-secondary: 18,000

- Other types of Education: 61,000



Private schools provided places for some 440,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 365,000; while 125 Government institutions catered for 120,000. In 1963 there were about 1,800 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $182 million as compared with $24 million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.



The University of Hong Kong has 1,956 students in four faculties—arts, science, medicine, and engineering and architecture. The Chinese University of Hong Kong, inaugurated in October 1963, has 1,368 students in three faculties—arts, science, and commerce and social science. The annual Government grants to the two Universities totalled $23 million for 1963–64.



Libraries



Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council Library and a small educational library at the Education Department. Various clubs have well-stocked libraries for the use of their members.



Medical and Health



The Health division of the Medical and Health Department undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and preventive measures against disease in schools. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work. The general state of health is good.



The Government maintains and operates fifteen general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to twelve other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony ten private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups (as on 31st March 1964) are 4,765, 4,709 and 1,303 respectively.



In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1963 totalled over 169,000 and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were over 933,000. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.



Government expenditure on these services during the year 1963–64 amounted to approximately $104.7 million, compared with $94.9 million in the previous year.



Capital expenditure on medical projects under the Public Works Non-Recurrent head accounted for another $29.67 million.



Cholera El Tor reappeared in June 1963, and cases appeared sporadically until the end of December. In all, there were 115 cases with 4 attributable deaths. A further case was reported in February 1964, and there was a sharp outbreak of the disease during May and June 1964, during which 33 cases including 4 deaths occurred.



The most serious health problem is tuberculosis; 13,031 cases were notified in 1963 with 13.5% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned over 2,300 deaths; infant mortality was 32.9 per 1,000 live births.



Communications



Air.—Hong Kong (Kai Tak) Airport with its 8,350 feet of runway continues to expand its

role in air travel. Since the opening of the runway in September 1958 together with its modern airport lighting system, regularity of aircraft movements has improved considerably. An instrument landing system, together with precision approach radar and long and medium range surveillance radar, has been installed and is operating most successfully and being used continually by airlines.



The increase of air traffic is maintained, both aircraft and passenger handling being higher than the previous year. The principal aircraft types are now Boeing 707 and 720, Douglas DC8, Comet, Convair 880 and 990, Britannia and Electra. During 1963-64, international flights by commercial aircraft carried 678,481 passengers, 5,063 tons of freight and 2,054 tons of mail, in addition to transit traffic.



Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1963 amounted to 462,262 metric tons and 7,932,442 passengers were carried.



Roads.—There are 543·83 miles of roadway, 97·6% of which is of metalled construction.



Shipping.—50,981 vessels entered and cleared during 1963-64, their net registered tonnage being 60,535,107; 1,428,687 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. Frequent ferry services cross the harbour and link the principal islands to the westward.



Sound and Television Broadcasting



Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW) and VHF/FM (5 kW) from two separate stations, in English and four Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 144,922 licence holders at the end of 1963. Rediffusion (Hong Kong), Limited, operate a wired broadcasting service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1963 there were some 33,934 subscribers to the service. Rediffusion Limited also operate a wired television service which had 25,037 subscribers at the end of 1963. A commercial broadcasting organization, the Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Co., Ltd., transmits programmes on medium wave (1 kW) in English and two Chinese dialects.



Principal Occupations



Before the war most of the urban population was engaged in commerce but, since 1948, there has been a significant growth of local industries. In June 1964, there were 354,932 employees in 8,189 registered and recorded factories and industrial undertakings: 145,796 of them were women. More than 150,000 were estimated as being employed in smaller cottage-type industries and as out-workers. About 90,000 were engaged in agriculture and fishing and 100,000 in building and construction.



The report of the 1961 census recorded an economically active population of 1,211,999. Only 15,802, mostly men, claimed that they were unemployed and 5,098 stated that they were seeking their first jobs. The main groups of occupations were as follows:



| Occupation                  | Number |

|----------------------------|--------|

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations



There are twenty-six Vegetable Marketing Cooperative Societies with a membership of more than 9,000. These Societies have formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition, two Irrigation Societies, five Salaried Workers’ Thrift and Loan Societies, nine Consumers’ and Credit Societies, one Fish Pond Society, 207 Housing Societies, ten Agricultural Credit Societies, twelve Better Living Societies, one Apartment Owners’ Society and 46 Pig Raising Societies have been formed. Many of the last named have also federated and formed a Federation of Pig Raising Societies. Fishermen are becoming more aware of the benefits of co-operation and there are 54 Fishermen’s Thrift and Loan Societies, three Fishermen’s Thrift Societies, three Fishermen’s Credit and Marketing Societies and two Fishermen’s Credit and Housing Societies. Forty-nine Fishermen’s Co-operative Societies have formed themselves into four Federations. The total number of members of Co-operative Societies is more than 20,000.



The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market in Kowloon from co-operative societies, collecting centres and depots in the New Territories. The collecting centres which are run by the farmers have, with the exception of two centres, now developed into co-operative societies.



Five wholesale fish markets are operated by the Fish Marketing Organization. A revolving loan fund with a present temporary ceiling of $3,000,000 has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; over $17,495,000 has been loaned from it. The Organization also operates schools for fishermen’s children and provides education for some 2,500 students at its 11 primary schools. 930 fishermen’s children are, in addition, attending other primary and secondary schools with financial assistance provided by the Organization.
