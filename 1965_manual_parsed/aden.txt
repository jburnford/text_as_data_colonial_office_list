ADEN



Area

Aden is situated about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles.



Population

At the census taken in 1955 the total population recorded was 138,441:



| Per cent. |

|-----------|

| Arabs     | 75·2 |

| Indians and Pakistanis | 11·4 |

| Somalis   | 7·7 |

| Jews      | 6·6 |

| Europeans | 3·2 |

| Others    | 1·9 |



Since the census was taken, the population of Aden has increased considerably and is now estimated at about 220,000.



Principal Towns



| Population |

|------------|

| Aden (including Tawahi, Maala, Crater, Khormaksar) | 99,285 |

| Sheikh Othman | 29,879 |

| Little Aden | 9,277 |



Geographical Features

The territory consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulae joined by a flat sandy foreshore, comprising:



(a) The peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the wharf and shipyard area of Maala, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Air Ministry for R.A.F. and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point.



(b) The isthmus known as Khormaksar where a large R.A.F. station and the Civil Airport are situated.



(c) The strip of mainland between the two peninsulae which encloses the modern harbour and contains the township of Sheikh Othman and the villages of Hiswa and Imad.



(d) The Little Aden peninsula where a modern refinery has been constructed by the Aden Petroleum Refinery Limited and where the two fishing villages of Bureika and Fukum lie.



Climate

The climate is not unhealthy, though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, i.e. between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent, but as much as eight inches has been known to fall in a year.



History

The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.



The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.



Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as the Colony of Aden from 1st April 1937.



Aden, a free port, owes its modern commercial prosperity largely to the fact that it is a refuelling station situated closer to the oil production centres of the Persian Gulf than any other great port on the main Eastern Trade routes. The opening of the B.P. Oil Refinery at Little Aden in July 1954 has added further to its prosperity and strengthened its position.



Constitution

By Additional Royal Instructions issued in November 1958, the following changes in the composition of the Executive Council of the Colony became effective:



The Executive Council consisted of five ex officio members including the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and a representative of the Senior Officer of the Forces stationed in the Colony, with five elected members or nominated members of the Legislative Council, not less than three of whom were to be elected members, selected and appointed by the Governor. These five unofficial members were initially styled "Members in charge" but in February 1961, their title was changed to "Ministers." There was provision for the Governor to assign the individual Ministers responsibility for matters at his discretion.



Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, a Legislative Council was constituted consisting of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, and not more than eight unofficial members. The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1955, provided for the introduction of an elected element into the Legislative Council. Under this Order, the Council consisted of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than five nominated official members, not more than five nominated unofficial members, and four elected members.



The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1958, provided for a Legislative Council consisting of a Speaker, five ex officio members, twelve elected members, and six nominated members. The first elections under the provisions of this Order took place on the 4th January, 1959.



In accordance with the provisions of the Federation of South Arabia (Accession of Aden) Order, 1963, Aden, while remaining under British sovereignty, became the twelfth Member State of the Federation on 18th January 1963 (see page 53). The title of the Governor was changed to High Commissioner for Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia.



On the same date there was brought into operation a more advanced constitution for Aden, prescribed in the Aden (Constitution) Order in Council, 1962. The Executive Council was replaced by a Council of Ministers, which consists of a Chief Minister and not less than six other Ministers (appointed by the High Commissioner on the advice of the Chief Minister), in addition to the Attorney-General. The High Commissioner is normally bound to act upon the advice of the Council of Ministers, subject to the retention of his general reserved powers, but he is responsible for external affairs, defence, internal security, Police, and the Aden Public Service. The Legislative Council now consists of 16 elected members, six nominated members, and the Attorney-General, as well as a Speaker.

The Federal Constitution having been given the force of law in Aden by the Accession Order in Council, the Government of the Federation of South Arabia has the power to legislate for Aden State on matters under its exclusive authority or under the concurrent authority of the Federation and the State. In any conflict of laws, Federal law will prevail over State law. The High Commissioner, however, retains over-riding powers in respect of security in Aden.



The new Constitution for Aden also includes a Code of Human Rights to which Federal legislation which applies to Aden will be subject.



**Land Policy**



Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1945, the High Commissioner is empowered to grant leases, or alienate, on Her Majesty's behalf, any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions, as he may think fit.



The administration of the Crown Lands Ordinance is under the charge of the Commissioner of Lands, who is appointed by the High Commissioner.



**Taxation**



Aden is a free port and there is no general customs tariff, although certain items bear Federal customs duty.



Income tax is a State matter and in Aden the Income Tax Ordinance, 1961, provides for the payment of a graduated tax by individuals ranging from Sh. 1/- to Sh. 15/- in the £ on chargeable income. Companies pay at the rate of Sh.6/50 in the £.

†Excludes figures for Public Utilities.



‡Excludes figures for Departments transferred to Federation after Aden's accession.



In 1962–63, £1,515,231 was derived from direct taxes (mainly income tax) and £1,623,272 from indirect taxes (mostly Customs and Excise). In 1963–64, the main heads of expenditure were:



- **Public Works**: £442,177

- **Public Debt**: £545,561

- **Police**: £430,145



Expenditure on Development projects in 1962–63 amounted to £1,514,686.



**Electricity**



During the latter part of 1963, legislation was introduced to establish a statutory Electricity Corporation to exercise the functions previously fulfilled by the Government Electricity Department. During the period of the Development Plan (1960–64) there was a project to spend £550,000 from Electricity Funds on increased generating capacity.



**Development Plans**



The Development Plan for the period 1960–64 was approved by the Legislative Council during 1960 and provided for expenditure as follows:



| Service                          | Expenditure |

|----------------------------------|-------------|

| Social Services                  |             |

| Education                        | £550,000    |

| Medical and Public Health        | £866,469    |

| Communications and Public Utilities excluding Electricity | £1,222,557 |

| Land and Housing                 | £2,127,000  |

| Miscellaneous                    | £694,000    |

| Residual 1955–60 Schemes         | £484,974    |

| **Total**                        | **£5,845,000** |



The Development Plan was financed through the Development Fund which obtains its resources by transfers from General Revenue, loans and Colonial Development and Welfare grants. For the period 1960–64 it was planned that £1,450,000 would come from General Revenue, £1 million from Colonial Development and Welfare grants, £274,000 from contributions from other authorities, £2,626,000 from loans and there was an opening balance of nearly £500,000.



**Libraries**



The Lake Library, administered by the Aden Municipality, contains 25,989 books in English, Arabic and Urdu and has 1,310 members.



There are well-stocked and expanding libraries at Aden College, the Technical Institute, the Boys' Secondary School and the Girls' College. Amenities for the teaching profession include a club with a library of over 2,000 volumes.



**Roads**



Aden has a total of 140 miles of roads, of which approximately 127 miles have a bituminous surface. There are no railways.



**Port**



Vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and the number of vessels which entered the Port of Aden during 1963, exclusive of country craft, was 6,306, with a net registered tonnage of 30,339,667. The number of country craft which entered the port during the same period was 1,413 with an aggregate net registered tonnage of 133,525. There are 20 first class berths and 7 second class berths. The first class berths are suitable for ships of from 350 to 800 feet in length. At present three of these berths are being modernised by the installation of dolphin mooring facilities, one of which was brought into commission during 1963. The second class berths are suitable for ships of about 300 feet in length. Thirteen of the first class berths are fitted with submarine pipelines for fuelling ships. There is also an 800 feet long quay with a depth alongside of 18 feet suitable for coasting vessels of up to 2,500 tons gross. Transit and storage sheds on the public wharves provide a total covered space of 400,000 square feet. The approach channel is dredged to 36 feet and three of the largest fuelling berths are dredged to 39 feet. The oil harbour at Little Aden has four jetty berths, the approach channel being dredged to 38 feet and the oil harbour to 40 feet.

Principal Occupations



Of the estimated local labour force of 78,053 some 7,487 are engaged in Port activities such as bunkering, handling of cargo, ship repairing, manning harbour vessels, etc.; 12,352 in building and construction which includes 1,559 men employed by the Services’ Works Department and 1,422 by the Aden Government and Aden Municipality; 1,367 in oil refining, 13,004 in industrial undertakings, 10,335 in retail and wholesale trades, 16,655 in Government and Services Departments, 1,220 in miscellaneous trades, and 17,000 in the hotel and catering trade and in private domestic service.



Main Products



There is no agriculture in Aden State and the only important local product is salt which is made from sea water by solar evaporation. The future of the industry is, however, uncertain because of the difficulty in finding suitable markets for it. Production in 1963 was 71,801 tons.



The Oil Refinery at Little Aden produces refined petroleum from imported crude oil. In July 1962 the Refinery had been in commission for eight years and in that time had processed over 31 million tons of crude oil. The products were exported either by tanker or as fuel for ships’ bunkers: a small percentage was retained in Aden to meet local demand.



Because of its favourable geographical position and its efficient service to ships, Aden has become one of the busiest oil bunkering ports in the world.



There are small factories in Aden which provide a variety of items: soap, carbon dioxide, recombined acetylene milk, soft drinks, aluminium pots and pans, cigarettes, dyed and printed cloth, wooden furniture, bricks, tiles and retreaded tyres. There is a small but flourishing industry for the blending and packing of perfumes, hair oil and toilet waters; a modern mechanical mill crushes oil seeds. Some Aden produce is sold locally and some is exported to neighbouring territories.



PROTECTORATE OF SOUTH ARABIA



(Previously known as the Aden Protectorate)



Area



The total area is approximately 111,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.



Population is estimated at:



- Western Area: 550,000

- Eastern Area: 318,000



Total: 868,000



Towns



There are no large towns in the Western Protectorate but in the Eastern Protectorate Mukalla, the sea port, has a population of some 25,000.



Geographical Features



The Protectorate of South Arabia is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba’ al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.



The Western Protectorate is divided into (a) the litoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000–2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the litoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.



The Eastern Protectorate also has a litoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 7,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.



Climate



The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months. During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but dry; in the winter it can be extremely cold. In the Wadi Hadhramaut, although the range of summer temperature is high, the air is dry and far less humid than on the coastal plain. The whole area falls within the influence of the northeast and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches; in the coastal areas of the eastern part, on the other hand, rainfall averages approximately two inches a year. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.



History



For a time in the eighteenth century, the Western Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana’a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam’s “wakils” or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.



After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty’s Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being in 1954.



In July 1915, during the first World War, the Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts of the Protectorate until the Armistice of 1918.



In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty’s Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1951 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.



In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa’i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with Her Majesty’s Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Treaties were signed by the...

Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952, and by the Sheikh of Shu'cib in 1954. The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949, and in 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a political officer as adviser.



The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Q'a'iti—a new Yafa'i dynasty which gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Q'a'iti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty's Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Q'a'iti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on him also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Q'a'iti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British Resident Adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammedan religion and customs. An advisory treaty was signed by the Sultan of Qishn and Soqotra in 1954.



Administration



Her Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Advisory Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.



In the Western Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by Her Majesty's Government. Not all the heads of the States and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning. There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa'i, Amiri, Lower Aulaqi, Shu'eibi, Dathina, Beihan, Upper Aulaqi and Wahidi and there are Legislative Councils in Lahej and Fadlhi. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force called the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate.



In the Eastern Protectorate the principal States are the Q'a'iti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The island of Soqotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultans of Qishn and Soqotra. Provincial administration of the Q'a'iti and Kathiri States is marked by a well developed system of local government based on town and village councils. Mukalla enjoys municipal elections to its council. Both States maintain efficient technical services of a modern pattern in the fields of health, education and finance.

Currency



The currency generally in use is the East African shilling, though Maria Theresa dollars are also to be found. The East African currency, which is issued by the East African Currency Board, is in various denominations—in notes (Shs. 100, Shs. 20, Shs. 10 and Shs. 5) and in coins (Sh. 1, Cts. 50, Cts. 10, Cts. 5 and Cts. 1).



The Federation, which is responsible for currency matters, is planning the issue of a new South Arabian currency based on the dinar; 1 dinar is equivalent to E.A.S. 20s. or £1 and is comprised of 1,000 fils.



Development



Between 1945 and 1963 the Protectorate of South Arabia received allocations totalling £3,400,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. Under the 1963 Act a further £2,250,000 has been allocated for the three-year period up to 1966.



Principal Occupations



With the exception of Aden, the people of the Protectorate of South Arabia depend largely on agriculture for their livelihood, cotton, dates and coffee being the most important cash crops.



In the Wadi Hadhramaut, with the assistance of a pump irrigation scheme, large quantities of dates, cotton and wheat are grown.



Livestock are raised with the related industry of preparation of hides and skins as well as dyeing and weaving. The principal occupation of people in the coastal region is fishing.



Main Crops and Products



The main crops are cotton, sorghum bulrush millet, wheat, barley, sesame and dates; other crops include finger millet, tobacco, lucerne, a wide variety of temperate vegetables, citrus and both tropical and temperate-zone fruit trees.



Long-staple cotton is the major export crop. It was first introduced into the Abyan area in 1949 and is now widely grown. The cotton crop is now expected to produce some 5,000 to 6,000 tons of cotton lint and some 9,000 to 10,000 tons cotton seed annually to a value of some £2,000,000.



Fruit and vegetables are produced in increasing quantities each year and nearly all are sold in Aden through the Central Wholesale Produce Market. The annual total of fruit and vegetables passing through the Central Wholesale Produce Market amounts to some 19,000 tons, worth up to £750,000.

The annual production of hookah (hamami) tobacco from the Eastern Aden Protectorate is about 700 tons and worth some £210,000; most of it is exported.



Cotton production figures in statistical bales of 400 lbs. cotton lint are:



| Season    | No. |

|-----------|-----|

| 1949–50   | 100 |

| 1950–51   | 1,587 |

| 1951–52   | 9,890 |

| 1952–53   | 11,161 |

| 1953–54   | 21,736 |

| 1954–55   | 22,140 |

| 1955–56   | 30,700 |

| 1956–57   | 28,310 |

| 1957–58   | 29,000 |

| 1958–59   | 18,806 |

| 1959–60   | 34,524 |

| 1960–61   | 21,554 |

| 1961–62   | 28,000 |

| 1962–63   | 34,700 |



The estimated livestock population is:

- Camels: 200,000

- Cattle: 200,000

- Goats: 2,500,000

- Sheep: 100,000

- Donkeys: 100,000



**Fisheries**



The amount of fish caught in Aden waters is very closely linked with the effect of the monsoon winds and consequently tends to be erratic. However, in a good season total landings may reach 5,000 tons, of which about 1,500 tons is consumed locally, the surplus being sold overseas through a group of exporters in the Salt and Dried Fish trade. Mechanisation of the local fishing boats and improvements in equipment have helped to maintain the supply of fresh fish in Aden in spite of the fact that a number of fishermen were drawn to employment ashore in the construction of the Oil Refinery. The increase in landings at fishing villages outside Aden has also helped to steady the local supply. Foreign interests have sent representatives to the area to investigate the possibility of starting an export trade in frozen fish to Europe. There has been a 90% changeover to nylon netting and the use of synthetic ropes and floats along the entire coast. Present policy is to develop the Ring net method for enclosing schools of surface fishes of the following types: Kingfish, Indian Mackerel, Indian Longtail Tunny and various types of Jack Mackerel. Recent assistance from the United Nations Technical Assistance Bureau is designed to develop Floating Longline methods for the capture of Yellowfin Tunny and adapt this method to local fishing vessels. The Crawfish Industry has been advanced in the last eighteen months, following active and successful marketing efforts. Cold storage facilities are provided from C.D. & W. funds.



The Co-operative and Marketing Department has introduced co-operation to the fishermen for fishing requisites in Aden waters and two societies have been formed.



The catch of wet fish in 1963 was 41,344 tons for the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Most of this fish is used for local consumption.



Crawfish have been discovered in commercial quantities in the Eastern Aden Protectorate and various methods of catching are being tested.



There is a market interest in the use of nylon fishing nets and this new knowledge is disseminated along the Protectorate coast by migrant fishermen and by demonstration by the staff of the Fisheries Department.



**Co-operative and Marketing**



The Co-operative and Marketing Department was established in mid-1955 and started field work towards the end of 1956. It has introduced and spread co-operative ideals and principles mainly among the farmers, fishermen and school students of Aden and the Protectorate of South Arabia.



The following is a list of the Co-operative and Marketing organisations in Aden and the Protectorate:



| Type                                      | No. |

|-------------------------------------------|-----|

| Cotton Producers' Associations (Marketing) | 6   |

| Co-operative Marketing Societies (other type) | 1   |

| Farmers' Co-operative Credit Societies    | 7   |

| Thrifts and Loans Co-operative Societies  | 2   |

| School Co-operative Canteens              | 6   |

| Employees' Co-operative Canteen (Staff)   | 1   |

| Consumers' Co-operative                   | 1   |

| School Co-operative Thrift Societies      | 28  |

| Co-operative Pharmacy                     | 2   |

| Fishermen's Co-operative Credit Societies | 1   |

| Fishermen's Fishing New Supply Co-operative Societies | 1 |



Total: 56 Societies



The total membership of these societies is about 22,000.



The Central Wholesale Produce Market, which opened at Khormaksar in November, 1959, is administered by a statutory Marketing Authority under the provisions of the Produce Marketing Ordinance of Aden. Its purpose is to rationalise the wholesale of fruit and vegetables in the interests of both the producers in the Protectorate and the consumers in Aden. It is a self-financing organisation with a turn-over of 21½ million shillings.



In the Eastern Protectorate the Co-operative Marketing Department has introduced cooperation among fishermen in the Qu’aiti State for the marketing of crawfish and turtles and among farmers in the Wadi Hadhramaut for the sale of dates and the rearing of chickens. A number of societies have also been formed particularly in the pharmaceutical trade, and thrift organisations exist among Junior Secondary and Secondary schools. Cold storage, fumigating and marketing facilities are establishing a market for crawfish and for dates.

THE STATES OF THE EASTERN PROTECTORATE



The Eastern Protectorate consists of the Q’aiti Sultanate of Shihir and Mukalla, the Kathiri Sultanate, and the Mahra Sultanate of Qishn and Soqota.



Land Policy



Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan Law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs).



Taxation



A small Income Tax is levied in the Q’aiti and Kathiri States. An import tax tariff is levied on products of every kind except those intended for agricultural or marine use. This tax varies between 17% and 22%. A tax of indigenous origin analogous to a “tithe” is applied to agricultural produce, but it varies with local agricultural conditions and is not an important source of revenue. In some areas, a tax is applied to each fertilised date-palm tree each season.



Rates are collected also by municipalities and councils on market transactions, irrigation pumps, cars, bicycles and wirelesses in most areas.



Public Finance



The latest figures of estimated revenue and expenditure of State administrations which have adopted regular accounting methods are as follows:



|                | 1961/1962 | 1962/1963 |

| Revenue        | £         | £         |

| Kathiri State  | 65,505    | 64,144    |



Development Plans



The E.A.P. Development Plan 1963–68 provides for a total expenditure of £1,743,939 over a five-year period from C.D. & W. sources. Of this sum, £476,205 has been allocated to economic projects; £942,564 to the social services; and £237,670 to communications and public utilities. There is a general reserve of £87,000. Towards these projects the Q’aiti State makes a considerable contribution each year (between £20,000 and £30,000). The education and health services, of necessity, represent the bulk of expenditure (the expenditure on education constitutes by far the largest single head—£634,527—and is almost double any other single service).



The Q’aiti State has allocated a total of £350,000 to its own Development Plan which is dovetailed with the E.A.P. Development Plan. Of this sum, the largest amounts are for education (£90,000), health (£92,000) and roads (£70,000). Water supply and fisheries are other important heads of expenditure. Up to the 31st March, 1963, the state had spent a total of £248,373 (£126,020 in 1962–63). Since 1950, considerable allocations, £153,000, have been made to agricultural development.



Communications



There are no railways in the Eastern Protectorate. A coastal road runs from Reidat al Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihir, Mukalla, Bir Ali and Balhaf to connect with the Western Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihir and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from Balhaf to Azzan and Habban. The approximate total mileage of motorable tracks in the Eastern Protectorate is 2,680 miles. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motors. Where these cannot yet penetrate the traffic is carried on camel caravans, which still travel to Mukalla and Shihir from other parts of the Protectorate in large numbers. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods. Sea communications along the coast are mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihir from Aden and ocean going vessels of the conventional type call at Mukalla from time to time.



THE STATES OF THE WESTERN PROTECTORATE



The States in the Western Protectorate are those of Abdali (i.e. Lahej), Alawi, Aqrabi, Audhali, Upper Aulaqi, Lower Aulaqi, Aulaqi Sheikhdom, Beihan, Dathina, Dhala (including Qutaibi), Fadhli, Haushabi, Lower Yafai, Upper Yafai, Shaib and Wahidi.



Land Policy



Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan Law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trust (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area.



Public Finance



The latest figures of estimated revenue and expenditure of state administrations which have adopted regular accounting methods are as follows:



|                | 1961–1962 | 1962–1963 |

Communications



A system of undeveloped but motorable roads links the principal towns and villages of the Protectorate, suitable for heavy lorries and vehicles of the landrover type. Surfaces vary widely from tarmacadam, as yet only in short stretches in the Abyan and Lahej areas relatively close to Aden, to open desert in the north towards Beihan. The principal route eastwards from Aden into the Protectorate lies for the first forty miles along a sand beach, where the going, at low tide, is excellent. For much of the area, the principal

routes traverse mountain areas following the lines of seasonally filled water courses. There is an ambitious programme for road building, the pace of execution of which depends on funds being available. Despite the natural handicaps to easy land communication, the flow of passengers and goods is maintained with rare interruption. Apart from trunk routes, which are a Federal responsibility, local routes are maintained by the member States of the Federation from State sources. Donkey and camel caravans are still used.



Regular air services connect Aden with the main centres of population in the Western Protectorate—Dhala, Mukeiras, Beihan, Dathina, Ataq, Mahfidd.



Sea communications along the coast are mainly by dhow.



There are no railways in the Western Protectorate.



FEDERATION OF SOUTH ARABIA



Population



The population of the Federation, including Aden, is currently estimated at 745,000, and the area at 24,000 square miles.



History



On the 11th February, 1959, a Federation of six States in the Western Aden Protectorate, called the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South, was inaugurated and a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Federation. The six federated states were the Emirates of Beihan and Dhala, the Fadhli, Audhali and Lower Yafai Sultanates and the Upper Aulaqi Sheikhdom. The treaty extended Her Majesty's protection to the Arab Emirates of the South and provided for military and financial assistance for it. The treaty also contained a provision for the accession of other states to the Federation (see Cmnd. 665). The Sultanate of Lahej acceded to the Federation in October, 1959, and three further accessions occurred in February, 1960—the state of Dathina, the Lower Aulaqi Sultanate and the Aqrabi Sheikhdom. In April, 1962, the Wahidi Sultanates joined the Federation. The Federation of the Arab Emirates of the South became known as the Federation of South Arabia on the 3rd May, 1962. Aden acceded in January, 1963, followed subsequently by the Haushabi Sultanate and the Shaib Sheikhdom in March of that year. There are now 14 member states of the Federation.



Administration



The legislative body of the Federation is the Federal Council, which consists of 94 members, each state being entitled to be represented by 6 members with the exception of the Aqrabi Sheikhdom (1 member), Aden (24) and the Sheikhdom of Shaib (3). Each state is free to select its representatives to the Federal Council by whatever means it considers appropriate.



The executive of the Federation is the Supreme Council consisting of 15 Ministers elected by and from Members of the Federal Council for a period of office not exceeding 5 years. The chairmanship of the Supreme Council is held by Ministers in rotation.



For internal security within the Federation, the Government Guards and the Tribal Guards of the Federated States have now been amalgamated into one force known as the Federal Guard. The Federal Minister of Internal Security is responsible to the Supreme Council for the control of this force.



In November, 1961, the Aden Protectorate Levies became the Federal Army which constitutes the defence force of the Federation.



Taxation



The levying and collection of customs dues is a Federal responsibility and receipts from customs dues represent the largest individual item in the Federal revenue. Taxes are levied on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and manufactures thereof, non-potable alcoholic mixtures, qat, aerated waters and petroleum products.



Public Finance



The revenue and expenditure figures for the Federation of South Arabia for the period 1960-63 are:



| Year   | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

|--------|-------------|-----------------|

| 1960/61 | 1,462,851   | 1,183,015       |

| 1961/62 | 1,522,264   | 1,545,578       |

| 1962/63 | 3,734,530   | 3,697,868       |



Development



The Federal Government is engaged in the preparation of a development plan which is not yet completed but which will cover education, agriculture, fisheries, communications, health, marketing and information services.



The Federation of South Arabia, which is an administering authority for C.D. & W. Schemes, has been allocated £1,250,000 from C.D. & W. Funds for the period 1963-66.



In the past the largest development scheme has been that in Abyan; this was initiated in 1947 with the aim of achieving a better use of land and water resources and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields, where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is administered by the Abyan Board, which consists of representatives of the two States in the Abyan area, with Governmental advice available, and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 50,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 120,000 acres.



Education



The Federal Ministry of Education is divided into two parts—Aden and the States.



In Aden the Education system consists of 4 years Primary, 3 years Intermediate and 4 years Secondary schooling, with facilities for a two-year "A" level course. Primary and Intermediate education is provided free for Adeni boys and girls; moderate fees are charged for Secondary education, with remission granted to poor pupils, while allowances are made to teachers in training. In addition, generous grants are made to Grant-in-aid schools. There are 21 Government Primary schools, 12 Grant-aided and 5 Private schools, providing education for 7,857 boys and 4,003 girls. Intermediate education is provided at 7 Government, 10 Grant-aided and 4 Private schools for 3,968 boys and 1,924 girls. Secondary education is provided mainly at 4 Government schools (3 for boys and 1 for girls) and the Technical Institute in Maalla with its branch at Little...

a total of 2,184 places), a new Men's Teacher Training Centre (78 men were enrolled in 1962) and a modern Women's Teacher Training Centre was opened in 1961, with 23 students (65 women were enrolled in 1962). Adult education is provided by part-time and evening classes at the Technical Institute, by evening and G.C.E. classes, special classes for the Police, Arabic language courses for non-Arabs and various courses for women at the Government Secondary School and at the Besse Centre. The expenditure on Aden education has risen from £6,600 in 1936 to £784,090 in 1962-63. There was provision under the Development plan (1960-64) for capital expenditure estimated at £550,000.



In the States there are 21 Primary schools providing education for 10,538 boys and 1,025 girls and 10 Intermediate schools providing education for 1,094 boys. In addition, secondary education is provided for 35 boys now in their first year at the new Al Ittihad College and teacher training is provided at a new Men's Teacher Training Centre for 40 students.



The Federal Ministry also undertakes a considerable amount of administration for the Overseas Studies Board. In January, 1960, an Aden Students' Office was established in London, with a Students' Liaison Officer. At the end of 1962, there were 88 scholars taking courses in higher education abroad; of these, 40 were provided for by the Government, the remainder being privately sponsored students. In addition, there is a considerable number of private students.



**Health**



The Federal Ministry of Health contains three main divisions—Curative, Port Health and Public Health.



The Curative Services are based on the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, two maternity clinics, three rural hospitals, five general dispensaries and over forty health units. The latter are satellites of the rural hospitals. Specialist facilities for surgery, medicine, ophthalmology, oto-rhino-laryngology and dermatology are based on the main general hospital in Aden. A mental hospital and infectious diseases hospital are now being constructed and four rural hospitals and many new health centres are to be built in the near future.



The following hospital beds are available:



| Hospital/Dispensary | Beds |

|---------------------|------|

| Queen Elizabeth Hospital | 495 (including tuberculosis) |

| Maternity Clinic, Crater | 84 |

| Maternity Clinic, Sheikh Othman | 20 |

| Home for aged persons | 56 |

| Rural hospitals | 165 |

| Keith Faulkner Hospital (Church of Scotland) | 40 |

| BP Refinery Hospital | 70 |



In 1962, the following number of patients attended Government institutions:



| Institution | In-Patients | Out-Patients |

|-------------|-------------|--------------|

| Queen Elizabeth Hospital | Male 5,188 Female 1,991 | 270,747 |

| Maternity Hospitals | 4,624 | 21,796 |

| Rural Hospitals | 1,378 | 46,853 |

| Out-patient Dispensaries | Male 122,573 Female 70,451 |



In the State of Aden, Public Health is under the control of the Aden Municipality and the townships of Sheikh Othman and Little Aden. In the rural areas, Public Health comes under the State Councils and small township authorities. In 1962, surveys were carried out in the fields of malaria, bilharzia and malnutrition. Malaria control is now being organised on a pre-eradication basis but the eventual eradication depends on the cooperation of neighbouring territories.



The estimates of the Ministry of Health for 1963-64 show a total expenditure of £780,555.



**Civil Aviation**



Aviation matters in the Federation, aerodromes and ancillary services, including the safety of aircraft, are under the exclusive authority of the Federal Government.



The main Civil Air Terminal is located at Khormaksar in Aden some 7 miles from the seaport and the aerodrome lies across the isthmus between the upper reaches of the inner harbour and the shore of the Gulf of Aden. The aerodrome is jointly used by the Royal Air Force and the Federal Department of Civil Aviation. The main runway, which is 10 feet above sea level, is bitumenised and has a length of 8,386 feet; its form of construction permits its use by the heaviest of modern aircraft. Navigational services for the common use of military and civil aircraft are jointly provided by the Royal Air Force and the Federal Department of Civil Aviation.



Twelve airlines operate scheduled services from, to and through the airport: Aden Airways, Air-India International, Alitalia, B.O.A.C., East African Airways Corporation, Ethiopian Air Lines, Ghana Airways, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Sudan Airways, United Arab Airlines and Yemen Airlines. Seven of these airlines operate Comet or Boeing 707 jet aircraft.



Operating a fleet of six DC 3 and two Viscount aircraft the local airline, Messrs. Aden Airways Limited, an associate of B.O.A.C., maintains a domestic network of regular services to destinations in the Federation of South Arabia and the Protectorate as well as scheduled services on international trunk routes to East Africa, Ethiopia, the Somali Republic, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Bahrain and Egypt.



**Broadcasting**



The South Arabian Broadcasting Service, which till 1963 was known as the Aden Broadcasting Service, and as such was inaugurated in 1954, now transmits for 11 hours daily in Arabic with 74 KW on 5,060 Kc/s and 5 KW on 785 Kc/s. It is estimated that about 200,000 receivers are in use in the Federation. These numbers are increasing rapidly with the advent in recent years of inexpensive transistor-type radios. Programmes in English are also broadcast daily on the network operated by the official Forces Broadcasting Service and the voluntary Aden Forces Broadcasting Association. Primarily for Service personnel and families in the Middle East Command, these broadcasts, which are of increasing popularity, provide a valuable complementary service to those operated by the Broadcasting Service in Arabic.



The South Arabian Broadcasting Service is now under the exclusive authority of the Federal

Government which may shortly enact legislation making the service into a public corporation which will broadcast 3 to 4 hours television nightly in both Arabic and English. Both sound and vision will be commercial.



Trade



Commerce and Industry are concurrent subjects in the Federal Constitution—i.e., matters in respect of which both the Federation and the State have legislative and executive authority, but there is a Federal Ministry of Commerce and Industry to provide general co-ordination and direction.



The principal imports are grain, flour, rice, dates, sugar, sesame oil, tea, kerosene, spice, cloth, cotton piece-goods, tobacco, cigarettes, soap and glassware.



The principal exports are cotton, coffee, skins and hides, lime, Hamami tobacco, cattle, ghee, sheep, goats and fish.



The bulk of the trade with the Eastern Aden Protectorate goes by sea to the port of Mukalla. No reliable figures are available.



The trade of Aden is mainly transhipment and entrepôt, the port serving as a centre of distribution to and from neighbouring territories. Traditional trade is mainly in textiles, gums and resins, grains and flour, coffee, tea, hides and skins, raw cotton and cottonseed and cheap consumer goods. There is also trade in dates, sugar, spices, oils, tobacco and shells and a flourishing trade in luxury goods such as cameras, watches, binoculars and cosmetics, which are sold to passengers coming ashore from ships refuelling in Aden harbour.



Value of Trade (excluding bullion and specie) through Aden.



| Year | Imports       | Exports*       |

|------|--------------|---------------|

| 1958 | £71,771,662  | £63,497,937   |

* Including ships’ stores and bunkers.



THE ISLANDS



KAMARAN



The island of Kamaran in the Red Sea (area 70 square miles) has been in British occupation since 1915. The High Commissioner for Aden has direct legislative powers over the island provided for in the Kamaran Order in Council, 1963, and the Kamaran Royal Instructions, 1963. The island is administered by the Commissioner for Kamaran and Perim. Until 1953, a quarantine station was situated in Kamaran for pilgrims on their way to Jedda by sea; this has been closed. Expenditure on the administration of Kamaran in 1962–63 was £38,172.



PERIM



Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799, the British took formal possession but evacuated the island the same year. It was reoccupied by the British in January, 1851, and was later used as a coaling station.



The Perim Order in Council, 1963, and the Perim Royal Instructions, 1963, vest the High Commissioner for Aden with legislative powers, and the island is administered by the Commissioner for Kamaran and Perim. Expenditure on the administration of Perim in 1962–63 was £22,123.



KURIA MURIA



The five Kuria Muria Islands were ceded to the United Kingdom in 1854 by the Sultan of Oman for the purpose of a cable station. The Kuria Islands Order in Council, 1963, and the Kuria Muria Islands Royal Instructions, 1963, vest the High Commissioner of Aden with legislative powers over the Islands but administration is carried out through the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.
