MONTserrat



Area and Geographical Features



The area of the island is about 38 square miles.

It is entirely volcanic, very mountainous and

comprises three main hill masses—Silver Hill in

the north (1,285 feet), Central Hills (2,450 feet)

and Soufrière Hills (Chance Peak 3,002 feet) in the

south. Forest and woodland cover about 10

square miles in the two main ranges and streams

are plentiful. The northern hills, however, are

almost without trees and in that part of the island

there is little cultivation.



Population



The population numbered 12,108 at the 1960

census, and was estimated to be about 13,000 at

the end of 1963.



Principal Town



Plymouth, the only town, had a population

of 1,911 at the 1960 census.



History



The island was colonized in 1632 when a

number of Irishmen of Sir Thomas Warner's com-

pany made their homes there. It was captured by

the French in 1667, restored to England at the

Peace of Breda later in the same year, capitu-

lated to the French again in 1782 and was finally

ceded to Britain in 1783.

Constitution



The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 57) except for the following differences:

(ii) The present composition of the Legislative Council is the Administrator, who presides, two official members, one nominated unofficial member and seven elected members.



(iii) Montserrat shares a joint Police Force with Antigua and the Virgin Islands. The head of this joint Force is appointed by the Administrator of Antigua acting in his discretion and gazetted ranks of the Force are appointed by the Administrator of Antigua after consultation with the Police Service Commission.
