Port Louis . . . 125,000 (new limits)

Curepipe . . . 46,250 "

Beau Bassin-Rose Hill . . . 64,430 "

Quatre Bornes . . . 36,760 "

Vacoas-Phoenix . . . 43,640 "



* Based on the 1962 Population Census.



Geographical Features



The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them are navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. Some of the larger waterfalls have been harnessed to supply hydro-electric power. The land rises gradually from the coasts and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Remnants of the native forests of the island cover some 15,000 acres.



Climate



The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The mean temperature varies from 24°C. at sea level to 19°C. at 2,000 feet. The highest and lowest values ever recorded at Pamplemousses at 180 feet are 35°C. and 10°C. and at Vacoas, at 1,394 feet on the western slopes, are 32°C. and 8°C.



Rainfall differs considerably according to the height above sea level. On the highest part of the central plateau an average of 200 inches falls each year but amounts decrease rapidly to 65 and 35 inches on the windward and leeward coasts. There is no marked dry season but in the three months from September to November rainfall is about one quarter of the fall in the three wettest months, January to March.



Tropical cyclones may occur between September and May but by far the greatest frequency is in January and February; March and April are also important months owing to the greater susceptibility to damage of the grown sugar cane. On the average in every century one may expect gusts of 75 m.p.h. 30 times and gusts of 150 m.p.h. once. In about 10% of all years mean wind speed over an hour exceeds 50 m.p.h. and gusts 100 m.p.h.

History



Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. Settlements were established from 1638 onwards but did not prosper and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French. A small first contingent of colonists was sent in 1721 from the neighbouring island of Réunion (then called Bourbon), but it was not actually occupied until 1722 when a small party of colonists was sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.



**Constitution**



The Government is vested in a Governor with a Council of Ministers and a Legislative Assembly. The Mauritius (Constitution) Order 1964 provides for a Legislative Assembly consisting of the Speaker (elected by the Assembly from among its members, other than members who are members of the Council of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries) one *ex-officio* member (the Chief Secretary), 40 elected members and such nominated members not exceeding 15 in number as the Governor may appoint.



The Colony is divided into 40 single-member constituencies and every person (male or female) has the right to vote who:



(a) is a British subject of the age of 21 years or upwards; and



(b) has resided in the Colony for a period of at least two years immediately before the date of registration or is domiciled in the Colony and is residing therein at that date; and



(c) has resided in the constituency in which he is entitled to be registered as a voter for a period of at least six months immediately before the date of registration.



The Council of Ministers consists of the Premier, the Chief Secretary and not less than ten nor more than thirteen appointed members. The Governor acting in his discretion appoints as Premier a member of the Legislative Assembly who appears to the Governor likely to command the support of the majority of members of that Assembly. The appointed members of the Council are persons who are elected or nominated members of the Legislative Assembly and are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Premier. The Governor may, after consultation with the Premier, appoint such persons from among the elected or nominated members of the Legislative Assembly as he may deem expedient to be Parliamentary Secretaries. The members of the Council and the Parliamentary Secretaries are responsible to the Governor and to the Legislative Assembly for all matters affecting the department with which they are associated.



**Land Policy**



Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unconceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) "Pas Geometriques" being inalienable land lying on the sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81-21 metres. Alienable Crown lands are sold only by public auction, but in the case of lands required for religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for public utility, free grants or concessions at a nominal price may be made or leases at a nominal rent may be granted. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands, including "Pas Geometriques," are leased by public auction but in special cases leases by private contract are granted.



The remaining five-sixths of the area of the island are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.



**Taxation**



Income tax rates for individuals are:



| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax cents |

|-------------------|------------------|

| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10 |

| For every rupee of the next : Rs. 5,000 | 15 |

For every rupee of the remainder of the chargeable income



Rates for Companies and Bodies corporate:



Banks and other companies whose business consists wholly or mainly of making loans for the purposes of trade, insurance companies, chargeable bodies corporate and foreign companies.



Other companies



40% of the chargeable income and 25% of the contribution income.



In ascertaining the chargeable income and the contribution income a number of deductions are allowed.



The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

Currency



The currency in circulation consists of notes bearing the effigy of H.M. Queen Elizabeth II of Rs.1,000 (legal tender between banks and Government only), Rs.25, Rs.10 and Rs.5; cupro-nickel coins of Rs.1, 50 cents, 25 cents and 10 cents and bronze coins of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The fixed rate of exchange is 1s. 6d. to the rupee.



Development Plans



The current Five-Year Reconstruction and Development Programme (1960–65) has been extended by another year up to mid-1966 and the ceiling of the Programme has been increased from Rs. 354 million to Rs. 400 million.



The main sources of finance envisaged for the Programme are as follows:



| Source of Finance | Rs.m |

|-------------------|------|

| Local resources   | 185·5|

| Colonial Development and Welfare funds (other than grants for the Central Housing Authority) | 33·9 |

| Loans and Grants from Colonial Grants and Loans Vote (other than loans and grants for the Central Housing Authority) | 27·4 |

| Loans and Grants from H.M.G. for Central Housing Authority | 72·2 |

| Potential assistance from external sources | 62·1 |

| **Total**         | **381·1** |



These figures show a gap of Rs. 19 million between the ceiling of the Programme and the potential resources. This shortfall is likely to be offset by under-expenditure. Projections do not take account of the raising of any additional loans from overseas during the remainder of the extended Programme.



The grant of Rs. 33·9 million from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds includes the territorial allocation of Rs. 16·6 million provided under the Commonwealth Development Act, 1963.



The projected expenditure can be broken down into four main sectors:



| Sector               | Rs. m | Percentage Allocation |

|----------------------|-------|-----------------------|

| Economic Services    | 84    | 21·0                  |

| Infra-Structure      | 158   | 39·5                  |

| Social Services      | 118   | 29·5                  |

| Miscellaneous        | 40    | 10·0                  |

| **Total**            | **400**| **100·0**             |



Education



On 31st October 1963 there were 718 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 278 were pre-primary schools, 325 primary schools, 110 secondary, two post-secondary and two Central Schools, one Technical Institute and Trade Centre, with a total of 171,160 pupils. The Government institutions comprised 129 primary schools, two central schools, four secondary schools, one training college for teachers, one post-secondary College of Agriculture and one Technical Institute. Thirteen secondary and 73 primary schools within the total given were State-aided; seven of the State-aided secondary schools had primary sections. There were also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The Government awarded six scholarships in 1963 for higher education overseas. Mauritian students overseas numbered 1,100, of whom 815 were in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities, 100 in France and 100 in India and Pakistan, 12 in the United States of America and Canada, 23 in Kenya and 25 in other countries; there were also 25 Government officers undergoing training overseas.



Adult education courses provide for post-primary and post-secondary education in Science, Handwork, Art, Typewriting, Book-keeping, Secretarial Training, “Builders Quantities”, Economics, Local Government, Telecommunications Mathematics, Telecommunications Practice, Technical Drawing, English Language and Electrical Engineering courses for apprentices.



In the financial year 1962–63 expenditure on education was Rs. 22·79 million (excluding capital expenditure on new buildings and other development works which cost Rs. 2·84 million). In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 1,347,201.



Libraries and Museums



There are seven Libraries:—(i) Mauritius Institute Library, Port Louis, (ii) Municipality of Port Louis Library, (iii) Police Library, Port Louis, (iv) Town Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill Library, (v) British Council Library, Rose Hill, (vi) Urban Council of Quatre Bornes Library, (vii) Carnegie Library, Curepipe.



The Natural History Museum, Port Louis, and the Historical Museum, Mahebourg, are both run by the Mauritius Institute. A small art gallery is also annexed to the Port Louis Museum.



Health



The vaccination of babies with D.P.T. Polio (Quadruple Vaccine) from Canada, inaugurated in 1960, has become a regular feature.



Alterations and improvements to hospitals have continued throughout the year.



The infantile mortality rate (59·3), is the lowest on record. The death rate was 9·6.



Help from the W.H.O. continued in respect of the scheme for the eradication of Malaria and Tuberculosis.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 13 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1963 was 1,587 in general hospitals, of which 195 were in Orthopaedic wards, 163 in Maternity wards and 151 in Tuberculosis wards. There were 735 beds at the Mental Hospital, 61 at the Leper Asylum, 46 in the Prison hospitals and 52 at the Emergency T.B. Hospital. In addition, 25 sugar estates provide each a small hospital with a total of 491 beds for the sole benefit of their employees. There were also five private nursing homes, 49 static dispensaries and out-patient departments of hospitals (excluding two out-patient departments of hospitals and two dispensaries in the prisons), five mobile dispensaries and four mobile dental clinics. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provides 31 static centres and one mobile antenatal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 45,756; attendances at static dispensaries numbered 1,632,132 and at mobile dispensaries 119,553.



The estimated expenditure on health services during the financial year 1963–64 amounted to Rs.19,207,633 against an actual expenditure of Rs.1,964,369 in 1929–30.



Communications



The airport (Plaisance) is operated and managed by the Colonial Government. Air France with “Super Constellation” aircraft operates a scheduled service thrice weekly between Reunion and Madagascar whence connections to Europe and other points can be made. British Overseas Airways Corporation provide a weekly VC 10 service between London and Mauritius via Rome—Khartoum—Nairobi. A weekly service between Australia and South Africa is operated by Qantas Empire Airways with “Electra” and by South African Airways in alternate weeks with DC 7B aircraft, the route being Sydney—Melbourne—Perth—Cocos—Mauritius—Johannesburg. (S.A.A. do not serve the first two points.) Rhodesian Air Services operate a fortnightly direct service between Salisbury and Mauritius with DC 4 aircraft. No internal services exist.



The railway carried 405,548 metric tons of freight in 1962–63. The railways are being closed down and, out of 68 miles main lines, 25½ miles were opened to traffic in 1963, but these lines are now closed to traffic and are being removed.



There are in the Colony 7-2 miles of motorway, 2-2 miles of a single 24 feet wide carriageway continuing the motorway into Harbour Square, Port Louis, 518 miles of main roads, 232 miles of branch roads and 63 miles of streets in villages and extra-urban areas. Of these 554·5 miles of main and branch roads have been tarred.



Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate eleven ocean-going vessels at any one time and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the British and Commonwealth Shipping Company and from continental ports by the French Compagnies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie. Havraise Peninsulaire; the Zim Israel Company provide a regular cargo service from Bombay and the Bank Line and O.S.K. Line provide a regular monthly cargo service from Japan and the Far East. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Interocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East—South Africa—South America service, to and from South Africa, and have a monthly cargo service from Australia on their Australian and South African run. During 1963, 528 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total of 1,624,816 net tons.



Broadcasting



The broadcasting service in Mauritius is now run by an Independent body, the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station at Malherbes operates on 439 metres, 683 kc/s medium wave and 30-90 metres and 61-86 metres, 9,710 and 4,850 kc/s with powers of 10 kW in both cases. In June 1964 there were 66,120 wireless licences in force in the Colony with an estimate of five listeners per receiver.



Principal Occupations



From a census taken on the 30th June 1962, altogether 70,866 persons were in agricultural employment which consists mainly of cane plantation and sugar manufacture. This figure includes agricultural workers numbering some 2,500, 280 and 300 employed in the cultivation of tea, tobacco and aloe fibre respectively. About 27,400 workers are in known employment in manufacturing, 20,000 in construction, 14,000 in electricity services and communications, and 35,000 in services, including central and local government.



In 1963 there were 91 registered trade unions including fourteen associations of employers and two federations of trade unions with 32 members. Total membership of the employees’ unions was 43,770.



Main Crops and Products



The main crops are sugar-cane, “aloe” (Furcraea) fibre, tea and tobacco. Sugar is produced in 23 factories which have been to a large measure re-equipped with up-to-date machinery in the recent years. Practically all the aloe fibre produced is spun locally and turned into bags for the sugar industry. Tea is being encouraged and the production was roughly 3,256,891 lbs. in 1963, about 1,081,398 lbs. of which were sold locally and the rest exported.



The tobacco produced is blended with imported leaves in the proportion of three to one for the manufacture of cigarettes for local consumption. Of the by-products of sugar cane 109,770 metric tons of molasses were exported and 17,360 hectolitres of high strength alcohol were produced.



The Livestock population as revealed by the livestock census carried out in 1964, is: milk breed cattle, 43,079; Zebu type herd cattle, 2,500 (including 1,084 draught bullocks); goats, 67,735; pigs, 3,671; sheep, 750; rabbits, 10,395; poultry and other birds, 467,361.



The catch of fish in territorial waters is approximately 2,000 tons a year of which 1,500 are landed at Controlled Stations.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**



The whole of the sugar produced is marketed by the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate. In 1963 the exports of sugar totalled 571,227 long tons. Of these 447,222 long tons including 368,500 tons of negotiated price sugar quota were exported to the United Kingdom. The rest of the exportable sugar was exported to Canada, the United States of America, Italy and Nyasaland.



On the 28th February 1963 there were 321 registered co-operative societies with a membership of 32,140, paid-up share capital amounting to Rs.2,069,478 and General Reserves totalling Rs.4,405,783. The turnover in goods and services for the year was Rs.41,113,105, including Rs.14,630,391 worth of sugar sold through 153 credit societies and Rs.1,295,673 as compensation from Cyclone and Drought Insurance, and Rs.42,067 worth of green tea leaves sold through six marketing societies, and Rs.114,190 worth of fish sold through eight fishermen's societies.
