BAHAMA ISLANDS



Area, etc.



The total land area of the Colony is 4,404 square miles. It is separated on the west from Florida by the Straits of Florida and on the south from Cuba by the Old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.



Population



The population at the end of 1963 was estimated at 131,428. Except for about 20%, the inhabitants are of the negro race. English is universally spoken.



Principal Town



Nassau, the capital, is the chief port and the only town of any size. It is situated on the island of New Providence, the population of which is estimated to be 81,591.



Geographical Features



The Colony consists of an archipelago of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are generally long, narrow and low-lying and are of aeolian limestone formation. The soil, except in small pockets, is shallow and overlays hard rock. On the whole, it is suitable only for peasant farming. Conditions are sub-tropical and both temperate and tropical trees grow literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.



Climate



The winter climate is delightful. Frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70°, the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. In July, August and September the heat ranges from 80° to 90° and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the Colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating, though this is mitigated in modern days by air conditioning. Although the customarily recognised season when the majority of visitors come to the Bahamas is in the winter, there is a growing number of persons who prefer the summer months because of the opportunities for swimming, sailing and fishing.



The rainfall averages about 40 inches a year. The rainy months are May, June, September and October.



History



San Salvador, one of the islands composing the Colony, and identical with Watling’s Island, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Arawak inhabitants were transported to work in the Hispaniola mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had settlements on any of the islands of the group at any time. In 1649 Parliament, on the petition of William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, and others, passed “An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands” which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding an earlier Royal Grant in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles II in 1670 granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. Before the 1670 Grant the inhabitants of the islands had organized the settlement and instituted a form of government, which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected their Governor. His appointment was later confirmed by the Lords Proprietors and a regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown in 1717.



The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1686 that the

settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica. By 1703 it had reached some importance, when it was almost annihilated by the French and Spaniards. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned once more. The islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place; since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1782, but were re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux and British possession was confirmed by the Peace of Versailles, 1783. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas group and received substantial assistance from England, and in 1787 the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.



The constitution of the Bahamas was eventually settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. The government was modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected House of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.



Up to January, 1964, representative, but not responsible government existed. The executive government was in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who had the power of veto, and was advised by an Executive Council of not more than nine members of whom six were unofficials. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation were vested by law in the Governor in Council. A Legislative Council was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841; and in 1963 it consisted of eleven members nominated by the Crown, of whom nine were unofficials.



The General Assembly Elections Act of 1959 provided for, inter alia, adult male suffrage, and a limited second vote in respect of ownership and/or rental of real property, the latter to be exercised only in a constituency other than that in which the elector resided. The Act also provided for the creation of two additional seats for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New Providence and the redistribution of the New Providence seats after by-elections to fill the new seats. Accordingly from 1960 the House of Assembly was composed of 33 members.



A law was promulgated with effect from mid-1962 extending the franchise to women and making women eligible for election to seats in the House of Assembly.



Constitution and Administration



At the Bahamas Constitutional Conference held in London in May, 1963, the Secretary of State agreed to further constitutional changes. These were embodied in a new Constitution which came into effect on the 7th January 1964, giving the territory full internal self-government.



The bicameral Legislature has been reconstituted to consist of an Upper House called the Senate and a Lower House called the House of Assembly.



The Senate consists of fifteen members of whom eight are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Premier and such other persons as he may in his discretion decide to consult, five by the Governor on the advice of the Premier, and two by the Governor on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition.



The House of Assembly remains unchanged until it is dissolved in the ordinary course. Thereafter the House of Assembly will consist of thirty-eight elected members, of whom not less than eighteen nor more than twenty-two members will represent Out Island constituencies, and not less than sixteen nor more than twenty members will represent New Providence constituencies. The next General Election will be contested on the basis of twenty-one seats for the Out Islands and seventeen for New Providence.



The Cabinet will consist of the Premier and not fewer than eight other Ministers. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears to him to be best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly. The remaining Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier.



Land Policy



The Status of Aliens Act Ch. 180 empowers an alien to acquire and hold property within the Colony.



Taxation



There is no income tax. Excise tax is charged on spirits and beer locally produced at the rate of four-fifths (4/5) of the import duty imposed on the particular kind of spirit or beer. The general Customs duty is 20% ad valorem plus 7½% ad valorem Emergency Tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no Emergency Tax; spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American Trade Agreements.



Public Finance



| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

|------|------------|----------------|

| 1959 | 6,456,795  | 6,420,512      |

| 1960 | 7,988,620  | 8,337,188      |

| 1961 | 8,563,582  | 8,574,914      |

| 1962 | 8,689,155  | 9,042,292      |

| 1963 | 9,599,255  | 9,834,388      |



The main sources of revenue are Customs dues and receipts from fees, Post Office, Licences and public utilities. In 1963 £5,979,487 of the revenue was derived from import duties. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:



Development Board (£1,136,813), Medical Department (£1,091,367), Public Works (£1,100,369), Education (£919,944) and Telecommunications (£661,315).



In December 1963 the outstanding amount of the authorized Public Debt was £1,651,771.



Currency



The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States and Canadian currencies are also generally accepted in the Colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are branch banks of the Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Bank of Commerce, Barclays Bank, D.C. and O., Bank of London and Montreal, First National City Bank of New York and Chase Manhattan Bank in Nassau.

Development



The development of a Free Port in the island of Grand Bahama offers excellent prospects for employment in the future. The proposed development, financed by American capital, embraces the construction of a large deep-water harbour at Hawksbill Creek. The Free Port Authority has acquired 50,000 acres of land and plans have been drawn up for zoned areas in the vicinity of the proposed harbour, for industrial projects of all kinds and town planning on the most up-to-date lines. This large-scale project is not a Government scheme but was approved by the Bahamas Legislature. Licences to operate within the Free Port area are granted by the Free Port Authority.



The Bahamas Government has undertaken to supply administrative, police, customs and immigration staff which will remain under its control. The Free Port Authority will provide its own medical and educational facilities but there is provision for inspection of these services by Bahamas Government medical and education officers. In general the closest liaison has been established between the Government and the Authority.



Education



A new comprehensive Education Act known as the Education Act 1962, and modelled in principle on the 1944 Education Act in the United Kingdom, came into effect on 1st September 1962. The new Act placed all government effort in the field of education under one authority, the Board of Education, and provided the machinery for the development of a modern system of education in the future.



The Act was amended in December 1963 in anticipation of the New Constitution which came into effect on 7th January 1964 and which gives the Bahamas internal self-government. All government effort in Education has now become the responsibility of the Minister for Education. The former Board of Education no longer exists but the Minister is advised by the Central Advisory Council for Education.



Under the Act education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 14. Of a total of 148 Government primary schools, 124 are rural, all-age schools.



There is one reformatory school for boys under the Industrial School Act and one for girls.



No local provision is made for Higher Education and students seeking this type of training must go abroad. Bahamians studying abroad in 1963-64 session were:



- 124 in the United Kingdom

- 100 in the United States of America

- 12 in Canada (as far as can be ascertained)

- 2 in University of the West Indies



Total 238.



The Teachers' Training College which was temporarily closed in 1957 was re-opened in September 1961. In addition, the Ministry of Education now has a scholarship scheme for:



(a) Refresher courses for experienced teachers;

(b) Degree courses;

(c) Specialist Diploma courses. Most of these courses are tenable in the United Kingdom, a few in Jamaica, West Indies and a few in Canada.



The following table shows the number of schools and of the children attending them in 1963-64 session:



| Primary School Roll | Secondary School Roll |

|---------------------|-----------------------|

| Government          | 148                   | 19,517                |

| Others              | 50                    | 6,833                 |

|                     | 198                   | 26,350                |

|                     |                       | 15                    | 5,439                |



The expenditure on Education in 1963 was £889,473. No figures are available for private and denominational schools.



Note: Under table showing number of schools etc. decrease in Secondary Schools is due to the fact that under a change in policy in 1963, no transfers were made from the Primary Schools into the Secondary Schools.



Libraries



There are three Public Libraries in Nassau and 27 in the Out Islands.



Health



The Curative needs of the Colony are met by:



(a) Princess Margaret Hospital with disciplines and full-time Consultant Specialists in Medicine, Surgery, Anaesthesia, Paediatrics, Chest Diseases, Pathology, Radiology, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Ophthalmology. An O.P.D. with 24-hour Emergency Casualty Service is provided.



(b) The Mental Hospital with Consultant Psychiatrist.



(c) The Geriatric Hospital.



(d) O.I. District Medical Officers (6).



(e) O.I. Clinics (42).



There is also a Health Centre and a Cottage Hospital in Eleuthera and a further Cottage Hospital in Inagua. A District Nursing Service exists. Public Health is administered from Nassau and the Public Health Nursing Service and Schools Medical and Dental Service cater for all preventive services.



In Nassau there is the Private Rassin Clinic.



Medical care is free to the needy and sub-economic rates are charged others.



In 1963, there were 11,786 admissions and 438 deaths. Maternity cases were 3,550. In the Casualty O.P.D., 41,314 patients were seen. In general the pattern of diseases is subtropical and not tropical, with respiratory diseases of all ages present and Tuberculosis appearing to be capable of control, hypertensive states common and social diseases e.g., Amoebiasis, Enteritis, Venereal diseases and malnutrition all associated with poor housing and utilities common in those areas concerned.



The General Public Health remains satisfactory and the Public Health Nursing Service increased its numbers in Infant Welfare, Immunisation and Vaccination, Home visiting, Ante and post-natal, and Communicable diseases services.



Total Recurrent Expenditure was:



- Hospital and Administration £830,553

- Public Health £256,429

- Capital Expenditure (Public Works) £39,376



giving a grand total of £1,126,358 or 11·2% of the Colony's Revenue.

Communications



Nassau International Airport is the main airfield in the Bahamas. It provides 24 hours service for long range international and local airlines. In addition, there are 29 landing strips completed in the various Out Islands. Scheduled international air services were operated into Nassau by B.O.A.C. from London via New York and Bermuda and from Montego Bay, Jamaica; Pan American World Airways operate daily flights from Miami and New York; Trans Canada Airlines from Montreal via Tampa, Florida; Mackey Airlines from Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Miami and Jacksonville; Bahamas Airways Limited operates between Nassau and Miami several times daily.



Bahamas Airways Limited operates daily scheduled flights to many of the Out Islands. Bahamas Air Traders operates a fleet of amphibian aircraft on charter to the Out Islands and Florida.



During 1963, 17,566 landings were recorded at Nassau International Airport.



The following mileage is of roads in New Providence, practically all of which may be used by motor traffic:

On Eleuthera there is an asphalt main road some 100 miles in length covering the whole of the Island and on Grand Bahama, 65 miles of motor road has been built. Asphalt roads are under construction at Andros, Exuma, Eleuthera, Cat Island, Spanish Wells, San Salvador, Long Island and Crooked Island, where previously only rough tracks existed.



There are no railways in the Colony.



There are regular freight services between the Colony and New York and Florida; Halifax and Montreal (Canadian National Steamship Line); and the United Kingdom (Royal Mail Line and Pacific Steam Navigation Company). West India Steamships Ltd. operate a service between Nassau and Inagua with intermediate stops.



In 1963 6,493 ships entered and 4,180 were cleared at Nassau. Their total tonnage was 10,066,569, of which 1,882,809 tons was British.



Ships also call at Inagua and Pine Ridge to take on salt and lumber exports.



Sound and Television Broadcasting



Government owns, and the Bahamas Broadcasting and Television Commission operates, a broadcasting station located in Nassau. The power of its transmitter is 10 kW., frequency 1,540 kc/s and call sign ZNS. Commercial operation began in 1950, though a broadcasting station has existed since 1936. The Commission took over on 1st January 1957. The broadcast receiver licence fee was abolished in 1954. At that time there were 5,990 licence holders. Government supplied and maintains 60 community receivers in school-houses in the Out Islands where there may be as many as 200 listeners in the evening.



In August 1962, a second channel opened transmission on a frequency of 1,240 kc/s with a power of 250 watts. The call sign is ZNS II. This covers the island of New Providence only. Commercial advertisements are restricted to single spots between programmes.



Principal Occupations



The tourist traffic continues to be the main industry of the Colony and is the chief source of revenue and of dollars.



The following table shows the number and nationality of visitors to New Providence during the years 1957-63:



| Year | Visitors | U.S.A. | Canada | U.K. | Others |

| 1963 | 398,676  | 82·2  | 12·0   | 2·2  | 3·6    |



Agricultural work in the United States provides employment for an average of 1,255 unskilled Bahamian labourers and their earnings in 1963 amounted to £769,116.



Main Crops and Products



The main crops are fresh vegetables, tomatoes, okra, pineapples, peas, citrus, bananas, avocados and sisal. Some sugar cane is grown in the Colony.



The Minister is fully alive to the importance of expanding the livestock husbandry of the Colony and of improving the quality of the products. This is being attained by the importation of purebred animals to facilitate the up-grading of local stocks of sheep and pigs; by the provision of pastures for small groups of farmers and by encouraging the establishment of herds of beef and dairy cattle. The estimated livestock population is: sheep 23,000, goats 14,000, swine 10,600, cattle 3,500, horses 3,520, poultry 610,000.



Crawfishing and scale fishing are extensively carried out during the open season (September 1st to March 15th). The bulk of the catch is exported to the United States. The following marine products are also exported: sponges, salt, turtle shell, beach shells and marine curios.



There are four canning plants in the Colony which are engaged principally in canning tomatoes and pineapples. Straw products are manufactured as cottage industries and the raw material for this work is obtained chiefly from palm fronds and sisal fibre. Most of the canneries' output is consumed locally.

In 1938 23·8% of total imports came from the U.K.; 18·5% from other Commonwealth countries and 57·7% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1963 were 15·8, 12·8 and 71·4.



In 1938 22·6% of exports went to the U.K.; 22·5% to other Commonwealth countries, and 54·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1963 were 2·9, 1·9 and 95·2.



Nearly all the Colony's requirements are imported. The chief imports in 1963 were provisions, hardware, fresh beef, furniture, lumber, apparel, and motor vehicles.



**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**



The Bahamas Produce Exchange in Nassau handles much of the agricultural produce of the Colony. It assists the farmers in New Providence and Out Islands in disposing of their produce without glutting the market and depressing prices unnecessarily.



There are no co-operative societies in the Colony other than 17 Tomato Growers' Associations on the Islands of Eleuthera and Cat Island and 21 active Farmers' Associations situated throughout the Colony. These associations are assisted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the extent of advancing seed and fertilizer, etc., for the tomato and other crops. The Ministry markets the crops and deducts their advances from the proceeds of each consignor.
