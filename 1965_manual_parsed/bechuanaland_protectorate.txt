**THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE**



**Area**



The Protectorate has not been surveyed as a whole, but its area is estimated at 222,000 square miles. The headquarters of the Protectorate Administration is at Gaberones, the new capital, to which the administration moved from Mafeking in February 1965.



**Population**



The census taken in 1956 showed a population of 3,173 Europeans, 676 Coloured, 248 Asians and 316,578 Africans. The provisional figure for 1964 Census of total population is 540,401.



The population is not evenly distributed, the bulk of the people living in the eastern part of the Protectorate with one fairly large tribe occupying the north-western corner. The central, western and southern areas of the territory, consisting for the most part of the Kalahari Desert, are extremely sparsely inhabited.



The Bechuanas tribes tend to live in large villages or towns. About one-half of the population lives in towns of more than 1,000 inhabitants.



**Principal Towns**



Francistown, Gaberones, Kanye, Lobatsi, Maun, Molepolole, Mochudi and Serowe.



**Geographical Features**



The Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good

Hope, on the south-east by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Southern Rhodesia, on the north by the Caprivi Zipfel and on the west by South West Africa. It lies between latitudes 18° and 37° south and longitudes 20° and 29° 50' east. The Kalahari Desert extends over most of the Protectorate west and south of Ngamiland as far as latitude 27°S. This is not a desert in the commonly accepted sense of the word, but consists of a vast expanse of undulating sand-belts with outcrops of limestone. In these limestone belts water is sometimes found at depths from 30 to 100 feet and it is possible that under the deep overburden of sand there may exist untapped reservoirs. The northern and south-western corners of the Kalahari have the least vegetation and most sand dunes, but elsewhere the grasses are excellent, and this is the natural habitat of the aboriginal Bushmen. Large areas are wooded like parklands with camel-thorn and other indigenous trees.



In the north-western part of the Protectorate the Okovango River, flowing inland from Angola, widens into a delta from which flood-waters, in seasons of heavy rainfall, flow as far south-east as the Makarikari salt-lake and south and southwest into Lake Ngami. The Chobe River, also flowing from Angola, inundates a large area in the north before flowing into the Zambesi 60 miles west of the Victoria Falls.



The mean altitude of the Protectorate is 3,300 feet and in the eastern portion occasional elevations, e.g. at Kanye, Serowe and Ghanzi, reach 4,000 to 5,000 feet.



The Protectorate as a whole is a natural game-reserve for most species of the fauna of Africa and Government policy aims at their preservation.



Climate



The climate is sub-tropical (latitude 22°S. passes through the centre of the Protectorate) but varies with latitude and altitude.



The average annual rainfall is 18 inches, varying from 27 inches in the north to 9 inches or less in the western Kalahari.



In the higher parts, days are pleasantly warm and the nights cold during the winter, but the summer is universally hot. In August seasonal winds blow from the west coast and, desiccated by the Kalahari, carry sand and dust across the whole country.



The atmosphere throughout the year is very dry and this helps somewhat to mitigate the high temperature.



History



In 1884 the British Government appointed a Deputy Commissioner to the Bechuana tribes and in 1885 the whole of the Bechuanaland was, with the concurrence of Khama and other principal chiefs, proclaimed to be under the protection of Her Majesty The Queen. The southern part of the territory, which included Mafeking, Vryburg and Kuruman, was at the same time constituted a Crown Colony with the title British Bechuanaland. In 1885 British Bechuanaland was annexed to Cape Colony, subsequently the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. The northern part, known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate, has continued to be administered by the Government of the United Kingdom.



The administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is governed by various Orders in Council and Proclamations, of which the most important is the Order in Council of Her Majesty Queen Victoria dated 9th May 1891. That Order empowered the then High Commissioner for South Africa to exercise on Her Majesty's behalf all the powers and jurisdiction which Her Majesty had or might have within the Protectorate and to that end authorized him to take or cause to be taken all such measures as he might think expedient, subject to such instructions as he might from time to time receive from Her Majesty or through a Secretary of State. Other provisions of the Order empowered the High Commissioner to appoint administrative and judicial officers and to assign their functions to them subject to the preservation of his own powers in their entirety and to provide, by proclamation from time to time, for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue and the peace, order and good government of all persons within the Protectorate, including the prohibition and punishment of acts tending to disturb the public peace.



In issuing these proclamations the High Commissioner was instructed by the Order in Council to respect any Native laws and customs by which the civil relations of any Native chiefs, tribes or population under Her Majesty's protection were at that time (viz., in May 1891) regulated, except in so far as the same might be incompatible with the due exercise of Her Majesty's power and jurisdiction or which were repugnant to humanity.



The Order required the High Commissioner to publish his proclamations in the Gazette and reserved to Her Majesty the right to disallow any such proclamation. The Order also provided that, subject to any proclamation lawfully issued by the High Commissioner, any jurisdiction exercisable otherwise than under this Order in Council of 1891, whether by virtue of any Statute or Order in Council, or of any treaty, or otherwise, should remain in full force.



Her Majesty reserved the power to revoke, alter, add to or amend this Order at any time.



Constitution



The Protectorate is administered by Her Majesty's Commissioner, and is divided for administrative purposes into 12 districts under District Commissioners who are assisted in the maintenance of law and order by a force of police.



The territory comprises Crown lands, blocks of European farms and tribal territories.



In the African areas the method of administration is that generally known as "indirect rule". Tribal administrations were formally established and the powers and rights of African authorities were defined in the African Administration and African Courts Proclamations of 1943 (Caps. 56 and 5 of the Laws, Cap. 56 having now been replaced by Proc. No. 24 of 1956) which replace the original Proclamations 74 and 75 of 1934. In 1938 Tribal Treasuries were successfully established in all Tribal Territories. Government pays 50% of each Tribal Administration's collection of African tax to the tribal treasury concerned; other sources of revenue are a graded tax and stand-rents. The Chiefs and Finance Committees, under the guidance of District Commissioners, are responsible for the preparation of estimates and general management of their treasuries.



On 28th July 1960 the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations announced his approval of proposals for a new constitution in the Protectorate. These proposals were promulgated by the Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution).

Order in Council, 1960, and provided for a Legislative Council with power to legislate for the Protectorate, subject to certain reserve powers remaining with the High Commissioner. The Legislative Council had an elected unofficial majority; there were 21 elected members, of whom 10 were European, 10 African and one Asian; there were also 10 Government officials and four nominated unofficial members. The European elected members were elected by European voters, subject to certain qualifications of age, residence and property or income; the Asian elected member was elected by Asian voters similarly qualified. The African elected members were elected by an African Council consisting of Chiefs of the eight principal tribes, 32 members elected by the tribal or district councils together with the official and appointed members. The Executive Council consisted of six officials and four unofficials two of whom were European and two African.



The Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) (Amendment) Order 1963 created, in place of the former post of Resident Commissioner, the post of Her Majesty's Commissioner equivalent in status to that of a Governor. It also empowered the Commissioner to assent to legislation and made him directly responsible to the Secretary of State. The post of High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland was abolished on the 1st August 1964.



On the 2nd June 1964 the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and for the Colonies announced the British Government's general agreement with the unanimous proposals for the revision of the constitution formulated, during the second half of 1963, at discussions initiated by the then Resident Commissioner in which representatives of all political parties and other important groups in Bechuanaland participated. The proposals provide for a Cabinet presided over by Her Majesty's Commissioner and consisting of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, up to five other Ministers drawn from the Legislative Assembly and the Financial Secretary as ex officio Minister of Finance. The Legislative Assembly is to consist of a Speaker, 31 elected members, four special members elected by the elected members, the Attorney-General (who may speak but not vote) and the Financial Secretary (for so long as he is ex officio Minister of Finance). A single voters' roll, based on universal adult suffrage, provides for the election of the 31 members from one-member constituencies. There is to be a House of Chiefs, consisting of the Chiefs of the 8 principal tribes and 4 other members elected by and from the sub-chiefs in the Chobe, Francistown, Ghanzi and Kgalagadi Districts with the special function of considering draft Bills affecting tribal matters as well as having the right to make representations to Government on any issue affecting the interests of the Tribes. Her Majesty's Commissioner will act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet subject to his special responsibility for external affairs, defence and security and the public service, and the retention of general reserve executive and legislative powers. A code of fundamental human rights, enforceable by the High Court, is also contained in the constitution. Elections under the new constitution are planned for the 1st March 1965.



Taxation



The main forms of direct taxation are African tax and African graded tax, income tax, personal tax and cattle export tax. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. The Bechuanaland Protectorate is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on all imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades, businesses and professions. There are also death duties.



| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |

|---------------|---------|-------------|

|               | £       | £           |

| 1960–61       | 1,283,734 | 2,288,620   |

| 1961–62       | 1,641,920 | 2,881,543   |

| 1962–63       | 1,652,245 | 3,066,738   |

| 1963–64(a)    | 1,749,541 | 3,355,815   |

| 1964–65(b)    | 2,329,128 | 4,217,110   |



(a) Revised Estimate (b) Estimate



Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare funds.



Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1964–65:



|                       | £       |

|-----------------------|---------|

| Customs and Excise    | 481,710 |

| Taxes and duties      | 768,290 |

| Posts and telegraphs   | 240,000 |

| Revenue from Government property | 226,750 |



United Kingdom grant-in-aid was £970,000 (1960–61); £1,155,000 (1961–62); £1,362,914 (1962–63) and £1,592,131 (1963–64).



As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the Territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved a grant-in-aid of £1,824,000 for 1964–65.



Currency



During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R. 2; 1 shilling = 10 cents). The Standard Bank of South Africa and Barclays Bank (D.C.O.) each have branches at Francistown, Lobatsi, Mahalapye and Gaberones.



Development Plans



Under the Commonwealth Development Act 1963, Bechuanaland received an allocation of £2,100,000. This, together with a supplementary allocation of £560,000 made earlier in 1963 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, and the unspent balance of previous allocations, gave the Protectorate approximately £2,716,000 towards development over the period 1963–66. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:



|                       | £       |

|-----------------------|---------|

| Agriculture and veterinary | 697,000 |

| Water supplies        | 547,000 |

| Education             | 825,000 |

| Roads                 | 988,000 |

| Headquarters           | 2,190,000 |



Education



There are eight main tribes in the Protectorate. Communications are primitive, distances great and financial resources far from commensurate with urgent needs. Consequently the administration and promotion of African education are unusually difficult.

Most of the administrative work has devolved upon tribal school committees and in three remote areas education is administered directly by the District Commissioners concerned and the Department of Education.



Primary Education. Enrolled in the 235 African primary schools in the Protectorate during 1963 were 54,845 pupils of whom approximately 56% were girls. The disparity between the sexes, caused by the absence of boys at cattle-posts and on the land, has had a retarding influence ever since schools were first established.



Secondary Education. Three of the eight secondary schools in the Territory are co-educational secondary boarding institutions offering the Cambridge School Certificate course.



These are Moeng College, founded by the late Mr. Tshekedi Khama, a Catholic Mission school, St. Joseph's College, near Gaberones and the London Missionary School, Moedig College, which was opened in 1962. All are grant-aided by Government.



The remaining five are day secondary schools which offer three-year courses leading to the Junior Certificate. Three are administered by Tribal School Committees, one is a grant-aided Catholic Mission school in Francistown and one is an independent unaided school in Serowe.



Total enrolment in 1963 was 965.



Trades Training. A Trades School, known now as Bechuanaland Training Centre, built at a cost of £65,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds was opened in 1962. It offers courses in building, carpentry and motor mechanics.



Teacher Training. One Teacher Training College is situated in Lobatsi and a second has been opened in Serowe. Capital cost of the latter, paid for from C.D. & W. funds amounted to approximately £100,000.



Total output from both Colleges will rise to about 100 per annum by 1966.



Youth Movements. There are 5,897 Boy Scouts divided into 123 groups and 6,166 Girl Guides, in 103 groups. Monthly bulletins are issued to all Scout and Guide officers. A government grant of £150 per year to the Girl Guides and £200 per year to the Boy Scouts is applied chiefly to training and travelling expenses.



The total estimated expenditure on educational service from funds controlled by Government, by Tribal Administrations and by missions during the year 1963 was £653,581. Of this total £75,482 was contributed by Colonial Development and Welfare schemes.



Health



There are eight hospitals in Bechuanaland, four of which are Government Hospitals; the remaining four are run by Missions. There are seven Government Health Centres and two Mission Health Centres. Forty-one Dispensaries are administered by Government, and 28 by Missions. Altogether there are 1,206 beds and 332 cots.



During 1963 there were 434,460 Out-patient attendances, of which 330,025 were first attendances and 55,906 were for Yellow Fever, Poliomyelitis, Typhoid, Diphtheria, Smallpox and BCG inoculations.



Maternity work, including ante-natal and postnatal care is mainly carried out in the hospitals but there is a special maternity centre administered by the London Missionary Society and supervised by the Government Medical Officer of the district.



The technical staff consists of the Director of Medical Services, the Deputy Director of Medical Services, the Medical Officer of Health, 14 Medical Officers, three Health Inspectors, the Senior Matron, three Matrons, one Sister-in-Charge, one Sister Tutor and 11 Nursing Sisters. There is a subsidiary African staff, trained and semi-trained.



African nurses are trained at both Government and Mission Hospitals. Midwives are trained at the Government Hospital, Francistown, at the Maun Maternity Centre and at the Molepolole Mission Hospital. Nurses undergo a four-year course in general nursing and then receive a year's course in Midwifery.



African Sanitary Inspectors are trained under the supervision of the Health Inspectors.



Communications



The main railway line from Cape Town to the north runs through the Protectorate, entering it at Ramathlabama, 886 miles from Cape Town, and leaving it at Ramaquabane, 394 miles farther north. The line runs roughly parallel to the eastern boundary of the territory at an average distance from it of about 50 miles. The railway within the territory is owned by the Rhodesia Railways and the section Mahalapye/Ramathlabama is operated by the South African Railways Administration as agents. The gauge is 3 feet 6 inches.



The roads are almost exclusively of earth or sand, the only exceptions being short lengths of gravel, and, in two townships, bitumen surfaces over short distances. There is limited bridging over the main rivers.



Thirty-two landing-grounds and emergency strips are maintained in the Protectorate.



Principal Occupations



The number of persons in regular employment, apart from those employed or self-employed in cattle raising, agriculture and domestic services, is estimated as follows:



| Occupation                                      | Number |

|-------------------------------------------------|--------|

| Mining and Quarrying                            | 850    |

| Manufacturing                                   | 1,000  |

| Construction                                    | 2,500  |

| Electricity, Water and Sanitary services         | 500    |

| Commerce                                        | 2,000  |

| Transport, Storage and Communications            | 1,000  |

| Services (Central and Local Government)         | 6,000  |



13,850



It is estimated that a further 35,000 Batswana work in the Republic of South Africa, mostly on a migratory basis. This means that a total of about 50,000 persons are employed in activities other than agriculture. On this basis, with a total population of 540,000, it is estimated that about 240,000 persons are employed in agriculture. The majority of these are self-employed cattle and grain farmers, generally at subsistence level.



Main Crops and Products



The main occupation of the Batswana is cattle raising. The number of cattle in 1963 was 1,349,773, of which 27,463 animals and 100,041 carcasses were exported. There were also 490,651 sheep, goats and pigs. Seasonal lack of water

and grazing and indifferent animal husbandry are the chief handicaps to the expansion of the industry.



Irregular rainfall and primitive agricultural practices, aggravated by the migration of able-bodied men to work in the Republic are the cause of occasional crop failures. The principal crops are sorghum and beans.



A little gold and some kyanite are mined in the north-east, asbestos near Kanye in the Banwaketse Reserve and manganese in the Bangwaketse and Bamalete Reserves.
