SWAZILAND



Area

Swaziland is bordered on the north, west and south by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Mozambique and on the south-east by Natal. It lies between latitudes 24° 50' and 26° 40' south and longitudes 30° 25' and 32° 5' east. With a total area of 6,704 square miles, it is a country of many diversities and many distinctive characteristics.



Population

In mid-1962 it was estimated that the total population was 280,300 comprising 270,000 Africans (an approximation) and, shown by a census of the two groups, 8,040 Europeans and 2,260 Euraficans. This figure includes about 10,300 residents employed temporarily outside the Territory. It is estimated that 26,810 residents were born in countries other than Swaziland (South Africa 19,020; Mozambique 4,070 and British Isles 760). The 1956 census showed that the population of Swaziland was 240,511.



Principal towns

The capital is Mbabane (population 8,400) and the next two largest proclaimed townships are Manzini (7,800) and Stegi (3,400). In addition, four new industrial centres have populations between 4,600 and 7,000. They are: Tshaneni/Mhlume (sugar), Big Bend/Ubombo (sugar), Bunya/Mhlambanyati (wood pulp) and Havelock (asbestos).

Geographical Features



Geographically and climatically, it is divisible into four physiographic provinces—the broken mountainous high-veld in the west, with altitudes averaging over 4,000 feet, the middle-veld which is mostly mixed farming country about 2,000 feet lower and the low-veld, a hot woodland region typified by aloes, acacias and pterocarpus, and bounded on the east by the Lubombo mountains, with an average altitude of 1,500 feet. The Lubombo mountains form the fourth physiographic province. Four rivers, the Komati, Usutu, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma, flow from west to east, cutting their way through the Lubombo mountains to the Indian Ocean. The exploitation of these rivers is particularly important to the agricultural development of the middle and bush veld, where irrigation projects are giving the scenery a different aspect.



Climate



75% to 80% of the rains come in the summer half of the year from October to March. Year to year variability of totals is extremely large, especially in the low-veld. Drought hazard is also most serious in the low-veld. The average rainfall at Mbabane in the high-veld is 54-6 inches, at Manzini (formerly Bremersdorp) in the middle-veld 35-6 inches and at Big Bend in the low-veld 20-8 inches. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively 72-8°F. and 51-6°F. at Mbabane; 79-2°F. and 56-4°F. at Manzini; and 84-5°F. and 59-8°F. at Big Bend.



History



Swaziland remained nominally independent until 1890. From 1890 to 1894 the United Kingdom and the Transvaal (South African Republic) Governments established a species of condominium which was replaced in 1894 by an arrangement under which the South African Republic was given powers of protection and administration without actual incorporation. After the Anglo-Boer war, the administration of Swaziland was transferred to the Governor of the Transvaal, who was also the High Commissioner of South Africa, but in 1907 responsibility for Swaziland was transferred from the Governor to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Swaziland therefore remained under the control of the United Kingdom when the Transvaal became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910.



Constitution



In 1902, at the end of the Anglo-Boer War, a British Special Commissioner with a small force of the South African Constabulary was sent into Swaziland to establish a provisional administration. An Order in Council, dated 25th June 1903, established the relationship between Great Britain and the Swazi and constituted the basic authority under which the Administration was conducted by Her Majesty's Government.



In May 1963 the Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs published a White Paper (Cmd. 2052) outlining a constitution for Swaziland. This constitution was established by the Swaziland Order in Council 1963, which was signed by Her Majesty the Queen on December 20th. It provides for an Executive Council of eight members (four official and four unofficial) and a Legislative Council with four official members; eight Swazi certified by the Ngwenyama-in-Council as elected by traditional methods; eight Europeans (four of whom will be elected by voters on a European roll and four of whom will be elected on a national roll); eight persons of any race elected on the national roll, and finally up to three members nominated by Her Majesty's Commissioner. Elections for the first Legislative Council took place in June 1964. The first meeting of the Legislative Council was held on the 9th September 1964.



The new post of Her Majesty's Commissioner for Swaziland was created by Order in Council in October in place of the post of Resident Commissioner. The new post is equivalent in status to that of Governor; the Commissioner assents to legislation and is directly responsible to the Secretary of State. In his administration of the Territory he is assisted and advised by the Chief Secretary, and by the heads of the various Government departments. The Territory is divided into districts administered by District Commissioners who are the principal executive officers of Government within their districts. The judiciary falls under the Chief Justice for Basutoland, Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland.



On August 23rd 1963 the then Resident Commissioner appointed a committee to consider the type and boundaries of future local authorities in Swaziland and the need for variations in existing administrative district boundaries. The committee's report was published on September 25th 1963 and their recommendations were accepted by His Excellency in October. Briefly they were that there should be four district councils based on four districts, and that immediate action should be taken to revise the district boundaries and promulgate an enabling District Councils Proclamation.



In December 1963 the former six district boundaries were varied by Government Notice and four districts were established and named as follows:



Shiselweni (formerly Hlatikulu).

Lubombo (formerly Stegi).

Manzini (formerly Manzini but now incorporating Mankaiana) and

Hhoho (formerly Pigg's Peak and now incorporating Mbabane).



In December 1963 the Secretary for Local Government assumed responsibility not only for local government matters but also for district administration.



A draft District Councils Proclamation has been prepared and is under consideration. Her Majesty's Commissioner has approved the drafts of the Town Management Board Proclamation and the Valuation of Immovable Property Proclamation. As soon as these proclamations have been promulgated town management boards will be established in Manzini and Mbabane.



A great deal of the structure of the traditional Swazi political system has been retained in the modern pattern of the National Administration. The Ngwenyama (the Paramount Chief) is a constitutional ruler who is advised by his kinsmen and chosen councillors and who cannot initiate action without the approval of two formally constituted councils. The smaller of the two councils, the Ligoqo, comprises the more important of the Ngwenyama's agnatic kin and a number of chosen advisers. The larger council is known as the Libandla, and at its widest extension, is a council of every adult male in the Nation. It is recognised as the final body from which approval for any contemplated act or legislation should be obtained. The Libandla meets only once a year, during the winter, when

it sits for about a month. Her Majesty's Commissioner and Administrative Officers meet the Libandla on one day whilst it is in session when matters which affect Government are put before it. A skeleton of the main Council sits weekly, or as needed, to transact the everyday business of the Nation. Close contact is maintained with Government through a Standing Committee which is appointed by the Ngwenyama in Libandla. It meets representatives of Government weekly and is the channel along which all Government business flows to and from the Swazi Nation. The Committee has rationalised and brought continuity to the work which had hitherto been performed by members of the Liqogo. There are, in addition, various committees of the Swazi National Council which deal with subjects such as finance and the organisation of the Lifa Fund. They have no legislative authority and are specialist bodies set up to deal with specific matters.



Proclamation No. 81 of 1950 provided for the establishment of the Swazi National Treasury, the revenue of which is derived from payments by Government of proportions of various taxes, all fines and fees from Swazi Courts and other sources. The Ngwenyama, the Ndlovukazi, Chiefs and Officers of the Swazi Administration are now paid from the National Treasury and other expenditure is incurred on agricultural, medical and educational projects. Ngwenyama in Libandla is empowered to make regulations, with the prior approval of Her Majesty's Commissioner, for the constitution and conduct of the National Treasury, for determining what money should be paid into it and the purpose for which its funds should be expended.



From the central institutions of the Swazi National Administration, responsibility for the routine administration of the country devolves upon the Chiefs and their Ndunas. Chiefs, of whom there are 172, each have their own Liqogo and Libandla to assist and advise them. They are subject, for administrative purposes, to the Governors of royal villages who are representative of the central authority. In an endeavour to provide focal points which would serve as centres of local government and through which the Ngwenyama's orders and instructions could be disseminated, twenty-nine Tinkundla or Rural District Councils were established in 1956. Each Nkundla consists of chiefs grouped together on a geographical basis under an appointed Chairman. They have no executive or financial powers, but in some areas they have provided an important point of contact between Government and the Swazi and have been of value in promoting rural development work. In the main, however, the conservatism of some of the chiefs, who have seen in these councils the means of curtailing their personal traditional powers, has stifled their effectiveness.



The function of the European Advisory Council, a statutory body established in terms of Proclamation No. 11 of 1949, has been to advise the Commissioner on matters directly affecting the European residents of Swaziland and on any matter specifically referred to the Council by the Commissioner.



The Eurafican community was not formally represented to Government although some Euraficans have made use of elected members of the European Advisory Council, whilst others tend towards the Swazi in sympathy and outlook.



One of the principal functions of the District Commissioner is to co-ordinate development work within his district without interfering in technical details. To assist him in this work, District Teams have been established under his chairmanship, to consider local problems and formulate plans for development, in accordance with policy decisions transmitted through the Secretariat from Her Majesty's Commissioner. They consist of the heads of the technical services in the District, such as the Medical, Education and Agricultural Departments, rural development workers and representatives of the Swazi.



Taxation



The main forms of direct taxation are African tax, European poll tax and income tax, towards which mining companies contribute the major share. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Swaziland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades. There are also death duties.



Public Finance



| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

|----------|-------------|-----------------|

| 1960–61  | 1,493,124   | 1,803,737       |

| 1961–62  | 1,667,628   | 2,077,628       |

| 1962–63  | 1,892,583   | 2,325,083       |

| 1963–64  | 1,955,231   | 2,818,972       |

| 1964–65 (Estimate) | 2,196,764 | 3,908,623 |



Excluding expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.



Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1964–65:



- Customs and Excise: £355,270

- Income tax: £986,000

- Posts and telegraphs: £213,375



As revenue was expected to fall below expenditure in 1964–65 and the central balance was exhausted, the United Kingdom Government approved a total grant-in-aid for 1964–65 amounting to £1,639,000.



Currency



The currency in circulation in Swaziland is that of the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).



Development Plans



Under the Commonwealth Development Act of 1963, Swaziland received an allocation of £2,300,000 towards development expenditure during the period 1963/66.



Taking into account savings carried forward from the previous allocations of Colonial Development and Welfare funds and also funds made available for Research projects, the total assistance made available towards the 1963/66 Development...

Plan was approximately £2,475,000, allocated as follows:



- Infrastructure: £190,000

- Economic: £798,000

- Social Services: £1,247,000

- Administrative: £225,000

- Reserved: £15,000



An additional £175,000 was made available from Commonwealth Development funds in November 1963, bringing the total assistance towards development expenditure in the period 1963/66 to £2·65m.



The construction of the first railway in Swaziland began in mid-1962 and was formally opened on November 5 1964. The railway runs a distance of 137 miles to the Mozambique border and links Swaziland with the port of Lourenço Marques. Its construction will make possible the development of large iron ore deposits at Ngwenya and will facilitate the export of wood pulp and sugar. The Swaziland Iron Ore Development Company has entered into an agreement to mine over 12 million tons of iron ore for shipment to Japan during the next 10 years. The first shipment of 60-70,000 long tons from the Ngwenya Mine was loaded at Lourenço Marques on December 7 1964.



**Education**



Schools in Swaziland were up to 1962 classified as African, European or Eurafican. The accepted policy of integration was put into practice in January 1963, and while the original race will predominate in the respective schools for some years to come, it is inappropriate to describe them as African, European or Eurafican.



There were, in 1963, 327 schools with 47,329 pupils made up of 44,944 Africans, 1,545 Europeans and 840 Euraficans. Of the total enrolment, 44,430 were in primary classes, 2,653 in secondary classes, and 246 in technical and vocational training classes.



**Health**



Posts are provided in the Medical Department for the Director, 13 Medical Officers, two Medical Officers of Health, two Pharmacists, 5 Dispensers, two Matrons, 18 Nursing Sisters, four Health Inspectors, 101 Nurses as well as auxiliary medical staff. 9 Doctors and 20 Nursing Sisters as well as 41 Nurses are employed at Mission Hospitals, subsidised by Government.



There are four Government hospitals, at Mbabane, Hlatikulu, Mankaiana and Pigg's Peak. At Mbabane there are 151 beds, Hlatikulu 137 beds, Mankaiana 28 beds and Pigg's Peak 39 beds. The Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital (Nazarene Mission) at Manzini has accommodation for 246 patients, the Roman Catholic Mission Hospital at Stegi for 35 patients and the Mahamba Methodist Hospital for 45 patients.



There are 11 Government, 24 Mission and three other clinics, financed by the Swazi National Treasury, in the Territory. The headquarters of the public health staff under the Medical Officer of Health is at Manzini where there is in addition a W.H.O./U.N.I.C.E.F. Tuberculosis Control Centre.



**Communications**



The road motor-transport services of the South African Railways Administration and the Portuguese East African Administration carry both goods and passengers and operate between Swaziland and the railheads in the neighbouring territories. A railway line to the Mozambique border has been under construction since 1962 and was formally opened on November 5 1964. The railway runs a distance of 137 miles and links up at the Mozambique border with the railway line to Lourenço Marques.



The Territory is served by a network of roads which are being rapidly brought to good standards, where is an extensive telecommunications system.



**Main Crops and Products**



Cattle form the main wealth of the Swazis and the total number owned increased from 146,542 in 1921 to 416,717 in 1963. The number of cattle owned by others increased from 63,748 in 1921 to 114,823 in 1963. In 1963 there were 221,619 goats, 43,201 sheep and 8,828 pigs.



Slaughter cattle are exported to markets in Johannesburg and Durban which are controlled by export quotas allocated by the South African Meat Industry Control Board. The number of cattle exported is increasing. In 1963 it was 26,692. Total production of butter in 1963 was 482,450 lbs.



Mining is an important part of Swaziland's economy. The Havelock asbestos mine in the north-western corner of the Territory is one of the largest asbestos mines in the world and is apparently assured of a life of at least 30 years at present rates of output. Rich deposits of iron ore north-west of Mbabane are being developed with the completion of the railway link to Mozambique. Other deposits of iron ore are known to occur in the Hhohho and Shiselweni districts. There is a small tin-mining industry and barytes is being worked in the Mbabane district. There are extensive deposits of low volatile bituminous and anthracitic coal in the low-veld. The bituminous coal deposits are being worked to provide coal for the railway and the sugar mills. The refractory minerals diaspore and andalusite are being worked near Sicunusa, where pyrophyllite is also being exploited. In the same district high grade kaolin is mined. There are three small gold mines in production in the Hhohho district. Recently further gold values have been intersected in encouraging exploratory work in the Hhohho area.



The agricultural potential of Swaziland is considerable and most crops can be grown. There has been an immense improvement in agricultural methods among the Swazi due to the stimulus of the rural development schemes which were inaugurated in 1949.



During the last ten years much has been done to lay the foundations for the development of this potential, both on Title Deed and Swazi Nation land. One of the most important aspects of this work has been the establishment of an agricultural research service in the Territory, based principally on Malkems Research Station and the Lonveld Experiment Station, Big Bend.



Maize, which is the staple food of the Swazi, is the most important dryland crop. Nevertheless, 133,000 bags of maize had to be imported in 1963 to meet the food requirements of the country.



The most important dryland cash crop is cotton. The 1963 production was 6,398 short tons valued at £435,000, a record figure. Other important dryland cash crops produced in 1963 were: tobacco (384,000 lb. worth £21,000), bananas (1,100 tons worth £26,000) and pineapples (2,370 tons worth £16,000).



Irrigation agriculture is centred on three main schemes; that on the Komati River, developed by the Colonial (now Commonwealth) Development Corporation, commands 30,000 acres of irrigable

land; the other two privately run projects at Malkems and Big Bend extract water from the Great Usutu River and command a total of 27,000 irrigable acres. There are numerous minor irrigation schemes throughout the middle and low-yeld regions and the total irrigated area in 1963 was close on 55,000 acres. Principal crops grown on these schemes are sugar cane, citrus and rice; the production of other irrigated crops such as cotton and maize is being investigated by the research service. During the 1962-63 season sugar production amounted to 85,400 tons of milled sugar from 754,000 tons of cane delivered to mills. Exports of 99,300 tons of sugar in the calendar year 1963 earned £4,115,500. Citrus fruit marketed through the local co-operative amounted to 135,000 export cases and 251,000 pockets in 1963 worth a total of about £150,000. There were 538,000 citrus trees in orchard by April 1963. The 1963 rice crop, worth £345,000, totalled 7,358 short tons.



The Republic of South Africa is the principal market for the Territory's agricultural produce. All cotton, tobacco, rice, bananas and some of the sugar produced find a ready market in that country. Rice, citrus and tobacco are marketed through co-operative organisations, the last two named being affiliated with similar organisations in the Republic of South Africa.



Considerable development has taken place in the forestry industry during the last two decades. The total area afforested by the end of 1963 was 225,000 acres, of which 180,000 acres were pines. The largest of the three main forestry projects, the Usutu Pulp Company, entered the production stage towards the end of 1961. This company, which was initiated by the Colonial Development Corporation (now the Commonwealth Development Corporation), aims to export 100,000 tons of unbleached wood pulp annually. Timber and timber products worth £2,133,000 were exported during 1963, as compared with only £420,000 in 1962.
