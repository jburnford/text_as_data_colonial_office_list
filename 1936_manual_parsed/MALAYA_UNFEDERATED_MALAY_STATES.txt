JOHORE.

His Highness Sir Ibrahim, G.C.M.G., G.B.E., etc., etc., Sultan and Sovereign Ruler of the State and Territories of Johore.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the North by Pahang, on the North-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the West by the Straits of Malacca, on the South by the Strait North of Singapore, and on the East by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,330 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the North-west running through the district on the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united *Seconded to the State of Kedah for relief duty.
to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the North, which, during part of its course forms the boundary with Pahang and Johore; and the Johore river which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bahru, the capital, situated on the Straits, opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Penggaram in Batu Pahat.

The climate approximates to that of Singapore and the Federated Malay States, the highest maximum and the lowest minimum temperature in 1934 being 98° and 65° respectively.

The population estimated at mid 1935 was 528,219, of whom the Malay inhabitants comprised 255,468 or 48 per cent. The population of Johore Bahru town was estimated as 21,777.

In area, Johore approximates to Wales; in population to Cyprus.

History.

Of Johore history little is known prior to the advent of the Portuguese. A number of semi-wild "proto-Malay" tribes exist chiefly along the coasts while the civilised occupants of the country are the descendants of the Malays who brought their civilization from Palembang in Sumatra.

As the Buddhist State of Palembang grew in power, colonies of Malays commenced to settle on the Peninsula. Singapore, founded under the name of Tamasek about this time, was ruled by its own kings. A Siamese law of 1360 includes Ujong Tanah (or Johore), Malaka, and Malayu among tributary states.

About 1365 A.D. Javanese from Majapahit conquered the country and destroyed Singapore.

Malacca then grew to be the first trading centre of the East, and after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511, a son of the conquered King settled at Johore Lama and founded the historic Sultanate of Johore.

The history of the next 300 years, however, is an almost uninterrupted record of wars. Persistent hostilities with the Portuguese continued even after the arrival of the Dutch in 1602. The State bears no small part in Dutch Colonial history; relations were friendly, despite a diplomatic struggle for commercial privileges. But, after violent attacks by the Achinese, Johore had become by 1637 practically an appanage of the Achinese Kingdom. In return for assistance rendered at the successful attack on Malacca in 1641, the Dutch tried to restore Johore to its former position as the premier Malay State. A port with a customs officer existed at Singapore. But the capital was plundered and burnt by Jambi in 1673, in 1699 the Sultan was assassinated, and in 1717 the throne was seized by a Sumatran adventurer, Raja Kechil. Then the Bugis ships appeared. The subsequent process, partly conquest, partly assimilation, while disturbing to Johore, resulted in a wide extension of its sovereignty, which now spread to Pahang, Siak, Riau, Linggi and part of Selangor.

After 60 years of continuous intrigues between the Malay and Bugis chiefs the Dutch in 1784 recognised the Malay Sultan as ruler of Johore, drove the Bugis from Riau and stationed there a Resident with a garrison; after some further fighting the Malay Sultan and the Bugis viceroy accepted the position of dependent princes, but the old empire of Johore (Linggi and Klang had been ceded to the Dutch in 1757) was in a state of dissolution, the Bendahara and Temenggong being virtually territorial chiefs in Pahang and Johore respectively. This was the position when the English, by virtue of treaties made in 1819 and 1824, obtained a complete cession of the island of Singapore.

Contemporary visitors emphasize the then deserted character of the country; in 1847 the capital consisted merely of 25 huts. (In 1855 the capital was moved to its present situation at Johore Bahru.) But the extension of the Pax Britannica and the assistance rendered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements "helped Johore to grow populous again," moreover, the country has been governed since 1855 by two enlightened and progressive rulers, Sultan Abubakar, who died in 1896, and Sultan Ibrahim the present ruler.

In 1895 the Sultan undertook to receive a British Agent having the functions of a Consular Officer; in 1910, the Sultan having had an unofficial adviser for some years, reorganised his Government with the assistance of the Governor of the Straits Settlements; in 1914 a General Adviser with enlarged powers was appointed. The recent history of the State has been a record of continued prosperity. Telephonic communication was established between Johore and Singapore in 1883; a postal service was inaugurated in 1884, letters being transported by coach till the opening of the railway across Singapore Island in 1903; in 1909 the Johore State railway, linking up with the Federated Malay States Railway system, was completed; finally, in 1924, the completion of the causeway across the Straits permits uninterrupted railway connection between Singapore and Bangkok.

Constitution.

In 1895 the late Sultan promulgated a written constitution, to which supplements have been added. His Highness has a Council of Ministers, consisting entirely of high Malay Officers of State, together with an Executive Council consisting of certain Malay and British officers.

The Orders of the Executive Council are carried out by a Civil Service containing Malay and European Officers.

The Legislature consists of a Council of State, to which Asiatic and European official and unofficial members are appointed.

The Judicial system resembles that of the Federated Malay States, minor cases being decided by Magistrates with appeal to the Supreme Court, and major cases by the Supreme Court, with appeal to the Court of Appeal, and thence in special cases to the Privy Council.

Cases involving matters regulated by Muhamadan law are decided in the Court of Kathi, with appeal to the Sultan in Executive Council.

Judges of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and of the Federated Malay States are ex-officio Judges of the State of Johore, and vice versa.

There is no Public Debt.

Johore is primarily an agricultural State. Forest Reserves amount to 721,920 acres and are being largely increased.

The total area of alienated land on 1st Jan., 1934, was 1,245,352 acres.

The chief agricultural exports in 1934 were:

- Iron-ore, 578,180 tons,
- China clay, 143 tons,

the total value of mineral exports amounting to $3,618,815.

The chief imports comprise rice, wines and spirits, tobacco, wood and timber (largely Johore Produce re-imported from Singapore), cotton-goods and petroleum products.

A branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is established at Johore Bahru and at Muar, and a Chinese bank at Batu Pahat.

Manufacturing industries are in their infancy, being confined to 8 pineapple factories, 13 tapioca factories, and a few saw-mills, brickworks, and similar undertakings.

Electric power stations have been erected at Johore Bahru, Muar, and Segamat.

Communications.

Sea.—Regular steamship services run between the various coast ports and Singapore.

During 1934, 78 ocean-going steamers with a tonnage of 263,459; 3,204 coasting steamers with a tonnage of 121,792; and 9,506 sailing vessels with a tonnage of 234,219 entered ports in the State.

There was an increase in the number and tonnage of Japanese ocean-going steamers calling at Batu Pahat to load iron-ore. The total weight of ore so cleared was 578,180 tons in 1934.

Railway.—The Johore State Railway runs for 120 miles through the middle of the State from Gemas on the northern boundary to Johore Bahru on the southern boundary; it is connected on each boundary with the system of the Federated Malay States Railway administration, by whom it was built and to whom it is leased.

Road.—At the end of 1934 the State possessed 763 miles of metalled, 54 miles of gravelled and 11 miles of earth roads as well as 52 miles of approach road and back lanes. All the principal towns are now connected by a road-system which is being continually extended.

Hired cars provide a cheap, constant, and rapid means of communication. About 1,200 motor vehicles a day cross the causeway connecting the main land with Singapore Island.

Post, Telegraphs, Telephones.—In addition to the General Post Office at Johore Bahru, 27 branch offices are established.

42 telephone exchanges are in operation, and the number will be increased. Communication is established between Johore Bahru and Singapore, and between Muar and the Malacca and Federated Malay States systems.

Accommodation.—The Johore Station Hotel at Johore Bahru provides the usual accommodation for travellers. The Government also maintains Rest Houses at Muar, Batu Pahat, Kota Tinggi, Segamat, Batu Anam, Mersing, and Kluang.

General.

Health.—Government Hospitals are established in the principal townships, besides a Mental Hospital and Lepor Asylum at Johore Bahru. Permanent anti-malarial measures are being undertaken in Johore Bahru and other townships, and culling operations are in force in all towns.

Travelling dispensaries have been provided.

Education.—The Government has established six English Schools and 123 Vernacular Schools. Grants-in-aid are made to estate Tamil Schools.

Military Forces.—The total strength of the Johore Military Forces in 1934 amounted to 645. There are English and Malay Volunteer contingents.

Police.—The force numbers 1,325, all ranks: the rank and file consist of Malays and Sikhs under Malay and English Officers.

Municipal.—Town Boards are established at Johore Bahru, Muar, Batu Pahat, Segamat, Kota Tinggi and Endau, supervising sanitary work in 27 Town Board Areas and many village areas.

Sport.—Subject to the regulations for the protection of wild animals, special permits may be obtained to shoot elephant, guar, rhinoceros, tapir, deer, tiger, panther, crocodile, and pig.

KEDAH.

His Highness Sir Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibni Ahmad Tajuddin, K.C.M.G., Sultan; His Highness Tunku Mahmud, K.B.E., C.M.G., Regent.

Kedah is a State on the West coast of the Malay Peninsula, situated between the parallels of 5° 6' and 6° 35' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 35' and 101° 10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (North and East) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded to Kedah by Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the South. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the North of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern water-shed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 101 miles in length and about 64 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi groups, about 3,640 square miles. The two highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Jerai (3,986 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,823 feet). Gunong Rais, on Langkawi Island, is 2,880 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammadanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was at various times under the domination of Malacca, Aceh and Siam. Like the other States too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul, Perlis, and part of Singgora on the North, and Krian on the South, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Opperhoofden (commandants) in Kedah from 1654 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese,
and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammad Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1843 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis, and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammedans. Only a few families of the aborigines (Semang) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River; 209 "nomadic aboriginals" were counted at the 1931 census.

South Kedah, the area lying South of the mountain known as Kedah Peak (Gunong Jerai), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying land along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang and to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 338,558 at the 1921 census and 429,691 at the 1931 census. At mid-1935 the population was estimated to be 452,554, of whom 306,073 were Malays, 435 Europeans, 123 Eurasians, 79,272 Chinese, 51,016 Indians, and 13,635 "other races."

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered, with the exception of a deposit of marble which is described as the equal of any in Europe.

Climate.

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the day-time rising to over 93° F. and falling to nearly 70° F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

Communications.

Steamers ply between Penang and Sungai Patani (Central Kedah), and between Penang and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 45 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (28 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road extends to Kuala Nerang at the 23rd mile from Alor Star. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak, and other metalled roads have been completed or are under construction. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns; 225 miles of canals are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Mertajam, in Province Wellesley and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier; trains have been running regularly since October, 1915. A connection through Perlis with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

There is an aerodrome at Alor Star, where the Imperial Airways and Royal Dutch Air Mail make regular landings on their homeward and outward journeys.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There are English schools in Alor Star (503 pupils) and Sungai Patani (173 pupils) and a Malay Girls' school in Alor Star. There are 87 Malay schools, including 5 Girls' schools, and a Trade school.

Constitution.

Until the beginning of this century the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

In 1905, the Sultan by an edict appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country. The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H. H. Tunku Mahmud.

In 1913, the Sultan's health became such that it was necessary to appoint a Regent, His Highness' eldest son, H.H. Tunku Ibrahim, C.M.G., C.V.O., remained Regent till his death in 1934. The present Regent is H. H. Tunku Mahmud, K.B.E., C.M.G.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Under the terms of the agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the State of Kedah dated the 1st November, 1923 the supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council, which Council consists of His Highness the Sultan as President, three other Malay members selected by name or office by His Highness with the approval of His Excellency the High Commissioner for the Malay States, and the British Adviser.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,800,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent, but the whole amount has been paid off and the State is now free from debt. Accumulated surplus funds (excess of Assets over
Liabilities) amounted to $5,360,812 at the end of A.H. 1353, in addition to an "Opium Revenue Replacement Fund" with investments valued at $6,383,579.

Public revenue and expenditure:

| Year       | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1353 (A.D. 1934-1935) | $6,711,272 | $5,314,856 |

Trade.

The following are the principal exports from Kedah:—Padi and rice, rubber, copra, arecanuts, tapioca and sago, forest produce, tin-ore, fish, bricks, cattle, hides and horns, pigs and poultry.

The value of the Kedah trade with the Straits Settlements during 1934 was as follows:—Exports, $27,650,670; imports, $9,333,884.

The value of Kedah trade with the F.M.S. during A.H. 1353 was:—Exports, $1,349,725; imports, $126,526.

PERLIS.

His Highness, Syed Alwi, C.M.G., C.B.E., Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the West coast of the Malay Peninsula, North of Kedah. Its area is 310 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano.

The Federated Malay States Railway runs through the State and connects with the Siamese railway system at Padang Besar. H.H. the Raja resides at Arau which is on the railway. The main Government Offices are at Kangar, about six miles from Arau. There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Kangar and
a telephone system exists between the police stations in the State. There are 374 miles of metalled roads and 284 miles of gravelled roads and paths kept up by Government.

The population is 51,101 (mid 1935) of whom 42,023 are Malays. Public revenue and expenditure:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1353 (A.D. 1934-5) | $62,382 | $487,130 |

The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer to suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. Repayment of these loans was completed in 1929, and the State is now free from debt. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam was replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The relations between Perlis and Great Britain are defined in a Treaty signed at Arau on 28th April, 1930.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are five other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

KELANTAN.

His Highness the Sultan Ismail ibni Almarhum Sultan Mohamed IV, K.C.M.G.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 4° 35' and 6° 15' North, and between longitudes 101° 22' and 102° 37' East. It is bounded on the North by the China Sea; on the East by Trengganu and the China Sea; on the South by Pahang; and on the West by Perak and Siamese territory. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,750 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the State according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the South. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 160 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kunia Tabal, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1931 census was 362,517, including 330,774 Malays, 17,612 Chinese, 6,752 Indians, 124 Europeans, 32 Eurasians, and 7,223 others. The total population estimated at mid 1935 was 378,600.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 14,843 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has 63 Malay vernacular schools attended by some 4,129 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Pahang has been completed. Kota Bharu is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Puteh, Kuala Krai, Pasir Mas, Bachok and Paleklang. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 3,431), Bachok (population 776), on the coast, Pasir Puteh (population 1,308) and Kuala Krai, the headquarters of the southern district of the State. The trunk road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai is open for traffic.

Pasir Puteh is connected with Kota Bharu by a road which is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, connecting Kelantan with Singapore, has been completed. There is also a daily train service between Tumpat and Penang via the Royal Siamese Railway.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the last harvest of which amounted to 35,097 tons. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown in the coastal plain. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years; in addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. The Area under rubber is about 75,590 acres, of which rather more than one half comprises Asiatic holdings. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large
industry, though it is necessary periodically to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Some 3,485 acres are held on mining titles. Though both tin and gold are found in Kelantan, yet very little mining is being done for either metal. Much prospecting for gold is being done in the Ulu Kelantan district, but is not yet sufficiently advanced to enable any forecast to be made as to its ultimate results. The amount of tin ore exported in 1934 was only 4,23 tons, gold ore 2,301 ounces, and manganese 8,968 tons.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, rubber, cattle, betelnuts, fish and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are rice, tobacco, cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90° F., or goes below 69° F., except in January and February, when 64° F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoon keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 110-25 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar. Regular steamship communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

TRENGGANU.

His Highness Sulaiman Badawi-l-alam Shah ibni Almarhum Zainal-abidin, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 0' and 5° 55' North, and longitude 102° 23' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 5,060 square miles.

The total population of the State, at the 1931 Census was 179,789, made up as follows:

|        |        |
|--------|--------|
| Malays | 164,564 |
| Chinese| 13,264  |
| Indians| 1,371   |
| Europeans| 35     |
| Eurasians| 16     |
| Others | 580    |

The total population estimated at mid 1935 was 188,992.

There are 146 miles of road open to traffic, including a road of 66 miles length from Kuala Trengganu which connects with the Kelantan road system at the boundary between Trengganu and Kelantan. There are no railways (except light railways on mines) and communication with the interior is mainly by means of rivers and paths. Telegraphic communication was established between the State, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements in 1922. There are telephone exchanges at Kuala Trengganu, Kemaman and Besut.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 13,972.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman Kretir, Dungun, Paka, Marang, Ibai, Setiu, and Besut.

The public revenue and expenditure for the year 1934 were $1,698,319 and $1,405,157 respectively.

The total value of exports from Trengganu in 1934 was $6,580,970 and of imports $3,460,829. The principal exports and imports were:

**Exports, 1934**

| Item          | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Tin ore       | $653,900|
| Para rubber   | $1,722,323|
| Haematite     | $2,102,124|
| Dried Fish    | $791,223 |
| Copra         | $62,772  |
| Manganese     | $77,451  |
| Areca-nuts    | $55,268  |
| Silk sarongs  | $121,728 |

**Imports, 1934**

| Item          | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Rice          | $1,021,343|
| Tobacco, cigars and cigarettes | $171,073 |
| Cotton and silk stuffs | $484,788 |
| Sugar         | $102,593 |
| Petroleum     | $162,900 |
| Tinned milk   | $69,312  |

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the North-east monsoon from November to February. The annual average is about 115 inches. The temperature ranges between 73° and 92° F. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper. During part of the N.E. monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable.

British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909. The suzerainty of Siam, transferred on that date to Great Britain, was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the bunga mas (golden leaves and flowers) to Bangkok. An agreement between His Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan...
Zainul'abidin was made on 22nd April, 1910, and a further Agreement was made on 24th May, 1918. Under these Agreements His Majesty's Government guarantees protection of the State from foreign aggression, and the Trengganu Government accepts a British Adviser whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues; the cost of this Adviser and his establishment to be determined by the High Commissioner and to be charged on the revenues of the State.

The ruling of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainul'abidin through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The Public debt at the end of 1934 amounted to $4,060,000. It consists of loans by the Government of the Straits Settlements for the purpose of resumption of Ruling House Land Concessions, Surveys, road construction and other development works.
