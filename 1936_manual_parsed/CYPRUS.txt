CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. Famagusta, with a harbour able to accommodate vessels up to 23 ft. draught, is 295 miles from Egypt, while the port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

Its area is 3,672 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Messoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphon to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce (or Stavrovouni), about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the garrison, of the Governor, and some of the principal officials.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Yalias.

History and Archaeology.

The history of Cyprus is too long and eventful to be related here except in the briefest outline. Excavations have shewn that in the second millennium B.C. the island must have been an important centre of Aegean civilization, having intercourse both with Assyria and with Egypt, and at a very early date important Greek and Phoenician colonies were established in it. In the 6th century B.C. it passed under the rule of Egypt, but in 525 B.C. it joined Cambyses in his war against the Egyptians and so was absorbed in the Persian Empire. The whole island, with the exception of the Phoenician town of Amathos, took part in the Ionio revolt in 502 B.C., but the Persians recovered possession in about a year and at the battle of Salamis the fleet of Xerxes included 150 Cyriote ships. At the end of the 6th century the famous Evagoras of Salamis established his supremacy over the whole island and raised it for a brief period to a position of practical independence, but after his death it again came under the control of Persia. After the battle of the Issus, Cyprus hastened to join Alexander the Great and sent 120 ships to assist him in the siege of Tyre. At the division of Alexander's Empire, the possession of Cyprus was disputed by Syria and Egypt, but it eventually passed to the latter. In 68 B.C. it became a Roman province and was for a time joined to Cilicia, during which period it was administered by Cicero. Presented by Antonius to Cleopatra, it reverted to Rome on her death, and remained a Roman province until the division of the Empire, when it was assigned to the Eastern Emperor. Its proximity to Syria exposed it to the assaults of the Saracens, and it changed hands more than once between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. It was finally recovered for Byzantium by Nicephorus Phocas in 965, and remained attached to the Eastern Empire until 1184. In that year its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. Isaac maintained his independence until 1191, when Cyprus was conquered by Richard I. of England in revenge for the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. Richard sold the island first to the Order of the Temple and later, when the Templars found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, but during that period the Genoese Republic exercised a suzerainty over part of the kingdom, from 1373 until 1484, by holding possessions of the principal port of Famagusta. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island, and retained possession of it until its cession to England in 1878 for administrative purposes. On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923 Turkey recognised the annexation.

On the 1st of May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally elevated to the status of a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Historical Monuments and Museums.

Bronze Age, Phoenician, Hellenic, and Roman antiquities have been found in immense quantities all over Cyprus from time immemorial, and scientific explorations on a large scale were conducted during the latter part of the last century, and even still an occasional treasure trove of importance may be found. But it is more the ambition of the present administration of antiquities to place the numerous classic sites and monuments in a condition rendering them accessible and of greater interest to the visitor than has hitherto been attempted. Paphos, Salamis, Idalion, and many other places demand attention in order to preserve their ancient character, now threatened by the island becoming once more a centre of revived life and activity. Salamis possesses the remains of probably the largest entrepot (Forum) ever built by the Romans, foreshadowing perhaps the famous "Emporium of the East" as Famagusta was called in the middle ages. A Roman temple of the largest size at Nea-Paphos lies in ruins which have never been explored (vide Hogarth's "Devis Cypria," 1899).

The Museum Nicosia, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria and much added to in recent years, contains a very magnificent collection of Cypriot pottery, stone carving, gold and metal works of art. Separate smaller collections of the medieval architectural fragments, which are always coming to light, have been formed as Musées Lapidaire in the principal towns.

The superb Gothic cathedrals and churches of Nicosia and Famagusta, in their curious Eastern surroundings, attract numerous visitors. These buildings, of the finest type of French medieval art, are singularly well preserved where they have been converted into mosques; in other cases they are interesting ruins.
The Venetian and Genoese Republics left few traces of their rule in the island beyond the imposing fortifications of the seaports of Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Limassol, all of which are scheduled as Ancient Monuments.

The number of Ancient Monuments in Cyprus now protected by the Antiquities Law of 1905 amounts to 70, many of which are mere barren historical sites devoid of any monumental remains.

Climate.

The mean temperature, as recorded in the screen at Nicosia, for the last fifteen years is 66°6' Fahr.; mean maximum, 78°5' Fahr.; mean minimum, 54°6' Fahr. Highest shade temperature during that time 111°; lowest 26°. Average rainfall for last ten years, 19°61 inches. The year 1934 had a rainfall of 23°68 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole Island. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. Malarial fevers are prevalent during the hot months, and, if the winter is mild, they occur throughout the year. Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees have, however, had a beneficial effect.

Population.

The population, excluding the military, in 1901 was 237,022; in 1911, 274,108; in 1921, 310,715 and in 1931, 347,808.

The Moeslem, who are all Ottoman Turks, form about 18°46 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Independent Cypriote Church.

The Cypriote Church is a branch of and in communion with the Orthodox Eastern Church, but is "autocephalous" (i.e., The Archbishop of Cyprus is not subordinate to any Patriarch). This position of independence it has retained undisputed since the 5th century when the Emperor Zeno finally decided against the claims of the Patriarch of Antioch to exercise authority over it.

Christianity was originally introduced into the island by St. Paul and St. Barnabas, the latter of whom, a Cypriote Jew by birth, was martyred at Salamis.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 23,507 inhabitants; Larnaca, 11,725; Limassol, 15,066. The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, the harbour and quay space have been considerably enlarged. The inner harbour is dredged over an area of 900 feet by 600 feet, to 24 feet at low water (ordinary spring tides), with a channel of approach 250 feet wide and 26 feet deep. The curtain wall, south of Othello's Tower, has been pierced with three arches, giving access from the town to the new quay. The quay is faced with a concrete wall 900 feet long in 24 feet of water. Further accommodation for sailing vessels and local craft has been provided in a basin 450 feet long, 200 feet wide, and 15 feet deep at low water. The town of Famagusta is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications and the inhabitants are nearly all Moeslem. The Christian suburb of Varosia is built on more modern lines. The combined population of Famagusta and Varosia is 8,771. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktema 4467, the modern capital of Paphos, on the southwest, and Kyrenia, 2,049, where a small harbour has been constructed, in the district of the same name on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania. A harbour for small coasting vessels exists at Paphos, the site of the ancient capital of that district. This had become silted up and almost useless, but it has recently been dredged sufficiently to enable small sailing vessels to enter and lie in safety.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its copper mines, and an American syndicate is now operating on a considerable scale in the Evrychou Valley and at Lefka with a crushing plant at Morphou Bay, where steamers call and load the ore. Gypsum is exported in the form of plaster-of-paris from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these ports it is sent monthly to Egypt, smaller quantities going to Turkey and Syria. Asbestos is found on Mount Troodos, and it is mined by the Cyprus and General Asbestos Company, Limited, capital 760,000L. The Company has established also at Amiadonos an asbestos brick and tile making plant, and a subsidiary Company a large steam bakery. Terra Umbra is burnt in large quantities in Larnaca and exported to Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States of America, in both a raw and burnt condition. Chrome is being mined by two companies. A factory for the preparation of sumach has since some years been established at Limassol. The development of the silk industry received great assistance from the establishment of a Silk Filature at Yeroskipos, in Paphos, which however was obliged to close down in 1934 owing to trade difficulties.

The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, caroube, wine, spirits and vinegar, tobacco and cigarettes, linseed, flax, aniseed, cumin seed, sumach, silk, silk cocoons, wool, straw, hides and skins, cotton, cotton seed, cheese, potatoes, onions, raisins, grapes, oranges, lemons, mandarines, pomegranates, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, almonds, and hazel nuts; cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, poultry and eggs are also exported.

Agriculture is dependent largely on irrigation, the water for which is obtained mainly from wells in the dry season and by flooding from streams during the rainy season. There are two streams which have their source in hill ranges which are tapped by drives into the hills, one at Lapithos and the other at Kythrea. Agriculture has been greatly retarded by the deficient rainfall and the lack of water for irrigation. Boring trials have, however, revealed the presence of artesian water which it is hoped to develop.

Special attention has been given in recent years to tobacco production. The itinerant Tobacco Instructors employed by the Government afford instruction to the peasant growers, and the efforts made have resulted in considerable improvement in the preparation of tobacco for the market. Since the operation of the Tobacco Law, 1932, which was enacted to amend and consolidate the Law with regard to the cultivation, manufacture and sale of tobacco, the industry has been placed on a more satisfactory basis and the production of tobacco of improved quality is more definitely encouraged.

Cyprus wine, which has been famous from early times, has lately received a good deal of attention. It was formerly a domestic industry, and the wines produced consequently lacked uniformity in character and quality. Modern methods of
manufacture have now been introduced and good light table wines are now on the market, owing mainly to the efforts of the Cyprus Wines and Spirits Co., Ltd., who have established modern wineries at Perapedhi, Mallia and Limassol. An effort is also being made to market Cyprus wines in the United Kingdom, and a Law has been enacted to prohibit the export to British Possessions of wines not coming up to the standards required. This, it is hoped, will secure recognition of the good wines produced in Cyprus and prevent the export of inferior wines, prejudicial to the marketing of the best Cyprus wines.

The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government Department of Agriculture and technical assistance and advice is rendered by the Veterinary, Horticultural, Entomological, Mycological, Viticultural and co-operative branches of the Department and by a field staff of itinerant Agricultural Officers.

A Central Experiment Farm has been established at Morphou and there is an Experimental Vineyard at Saitta, a Citrus Experimental Grove at Famagusta, a Deciduous Fruit Nursery at Trikoukki and Nursery Gardens in suitable centres for the distribution of seeds and plans.

Considerable attention is given by the Government to animal husbandry. Cyprus is famous for its donkeys and mules. The Government maintains a stock farm at Athalassa and stud stables throughout the Island. Good breeds of cattle, horses, pigs, and goats are imported for the improvement of the local breeds. Good breeds of poultry are maintained by the Government for distribution. The export of poultry and eggs is increasing, and there is considerable room for expansion.

The heavy tariff now imposed by the Egyptian Government on fruits has adversely affected the fruit export trade to Egypt and exporters are now unable to look to that market as an assured outlet for fruits and vegetables. In addition the economic difficulties encountered in marketing Cyprus produce in Greece have forced merchants to seek markets further afield. Such markets demand a higher standard of grading and packing before trade can be established on a permanent footing and in order to extend and encourage this trade to more distant markets a new Law known as the Agricultural Produce (Export) Law, 1933, has been brought into operation. Under this Law a Produce Inspection Service has been organised and Regulations for the inspection of Citrus Fruits and Potatoes before export are enforced. Regulations for the inspection of other produce before export are contemplated.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as the pits were topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts became more scattered, was discarded in favour of a system of collecting locust eggs and purchasing live locusts. Both the purchase and the spraying systems have been employed in recent years. The spraying system has latterly been replaced by the use of poisoned bran bait.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the depredations of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a large number, and partly in consequence of the forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing is carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek Islands. Sponge fishers are issued a licence at a nominal fee and the Government takes a duty in kind of 20% in the case of harpoon boats and 25% in the case of machine boats of the catch.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected by the local fishermen, who only use trammel nets and long line, but Italian and Greek trawlers work most of the year and fish is becoming more plentiful in the market than heretofore.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, fertilisers, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, silk cocoons, linseed, aniseed, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, asbestos, gypsum, iron pyrites, chrome and terra umbra.

The Customs import duties are mostly on a specific basis. The ad valorem duties vary from 15 to 30 per cent.

A preference is granted on most classes of imports from British sources.

The following is the percentage of trade with the United Kingdom, other parts of the British Empire and the principal foreign countries:

| Country                  | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| United Kingdom           | 34-94      |
| Other parts of the British Empire | 10-68    |
| Roumania                 | 7-08       |
| Italy                    | 6-60       |
| Germany                  | 5-71       |
| Empire of Japan          | 5-58       |
| Greece                   | 4-66       |
| Egypt                    | 4-80       |
| Belgium                  | 2-33       |
| France                   | 1-87       |
| United States of America | 1-74       |
| Turkey                   | 1-42       |
| Czechoslovakia           | 1-36       |
| Holland                  | 1-34       |
| Austria                  | 0-96       |
| Bulgaria                 | 0-95       |
| Other countries          | 7-68       |

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1901, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign. Silver, 18, 9, 4½, 3 piastre pieces, limit of tender 540 piastres (nine equal to one shilling). Bronze, 1 piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras = 1 piastre). By a proclamation dated the 7th of January, 1936, bronze coins, with the exception of the quarter piastre piece, are in course of withdrawal from circulation and are being replaced by cupro-nickel coins of the same denominations. By proclamation of 28th April, 1928, a new silver 45-piastre piece is current and legal tender in the colony as from that date. Currency Notes were issued from time to time from September, 1914, as a
war measure. Notes of the following denominations are in circulation:—5l., 1l., 10s. By an Order-in-Council of 1st November, 1928, the Treasurer as "Commissioner" of Currency was authorised to issue Currency Notes of the Government; such Notes are to be legal tender, and provision was made for the conversion of the Notes into sterling and vice versa, and for the establishment of a Note Security Fund.

The Ottoman Bank has branches at Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, also at Troodos during summer season.

The Bank of Athens has branches at Limassol and Nicosia, with Correspondents at Larnaca, Famagusta and Paphos.

The Ionian Bank has a branch at Nicosia, agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, and Correspondents at Kyrenia and Morphou.

The Bank of Cyprus, has its Head Office at Nicosia, agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos, Kyrenia and Morphou.

The Agricultural Bank of Cyprus, Limited, which operates under a Government Guarantee, was established in 1925, with Head Offices at Nicosia. It lends money to farmers through the medium of Co-operative Credit Societies or direct to individuals.

Other banks operating in Cyprus are Bank of Larnaca, Limited and Emmet Bank, Limited with Head Offices at Larnaca; Peoples Bank, Limassol, Limited, with Head Office at Limassol; Famagusta Bank, Limited, with Head Office at Famagusta; Popular Bank of Paphos, Limited, and Melissa Bank, Limited, with Head Offices at Paphos.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke = 28lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum = about ½ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

The Cyprus Government Railway of 2' 6" gauge extended originally from Famagusta Harbour to the Capital, Nicosia, and then to Morphou and up to the foot-hills of Troodos at Evrychou.

Owing to uneconomic results of the working of the Section Nicosia to Evrychou for the past few years it was closed for scheduled traffic.

There is no navigable waterway in the island. The main and secondary roads have recently been reconstructed and good roads exist between all important centres. Most villages are connected with these roads by cart roads. There are motor car services between the chief towns of each district. The Famagusta harbour was completed in 1906, and was enlarged in 1932-33 with assistance from the Colonial Development Fund. An extension to the pier at Larnaca with a sheltering arm at the sea end was completed in 1909. The ancient harbour at Paphos and the harbour at Kyrenia are of sufficient depth to admit of their use by the small coasting craft that trade between Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor and Cyprus. There are no Government telegraphs, other than those along the railway, but the Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, maintain cables between Egypt and Cyprus and Palestine and Cyprus, and land lines connecting the six principal towns of the Island also at Pedoulas, Platres, Prodromos and Troodos during the summer season, June to September. Arrangements are being made for connecting all the principal towns by telephone.

A weekly mail service is maintained between Egypt and Cyprus by subsidised steamers of the Khedivial S.S. Company. Steamers of the Lloyd Triestino Company, of Trieste, call fortnightly from Italy via Greece en route for Egypt, Palestine and Syria on the outward voyage and fortnightly from Mersina en route for Rhodes, Greece and Italy; fortnightly from Italy via Greece en route for Mersina, Syria, Palestine and Egypt; fortnightly from Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Mersina en route for Rhodes, Greece and Italy. There is also a subsidised Lloyd Triestino Express service from Italy calling weekly at Cyprus en route for Palestine and Syria on the outward voyage, and making calls weekly at Palestine and Cyprus on the homeward voyage. Steamers of the Messageries Maritimes call once every four weeks from France via Italy, Greece and Turkey en route for Syria and France. Mails for Arabia, North-West India, Iraq and Persia are forwarded weekly to Jaffa, for onward transmission by the Overland Mail Service Palestine-Iraq; and mails destined for countries served by the England-India or the Cairo-East and South Africa Air Mail Services are despatched weekly to Palestine and Egypt, respectively, by the ordinary route for onward transmission by air.

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal Colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the Colony. Money Orders and British Postal Orders are also issued and paid in the Colony. "Cash on Delivery" parcels for delivery within the Colony are accepted and delivered at the principal post offices. A reciprocal service of "Cash on Delivery" of parcels has been established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom, Egypt and the Sudan.

Education: (a) Elementary.

A general system of grants-in-aid of elementary schools was established in 1882, and further regulated by various laws up to 1929, when Government assumed the chief responsibility for elementary education. In 1933 the Governor became the central authority for all matters connected with elementary education, including the appointment and discipline of teachers and control of books and curriculum. Teachers' salaries and gratuities on retirement are paid by the Government, but the provision and maintenance of schools is met from local rates, with assistance from Education Funds under Government control.

There are separate schools for each religious community, i.e., Orthodox-Christian, about 81 per
cent. of the population, Moslem, about 18 per cent., and smaller communities of Armenians, Maronites, Latin Catholics and Jews. For each community there is a Board of Education with advisory functions and has control over the amounts to be raised by local rates.

Education is not compulsory. The following are the statistics of schools and enrolments for the school-year 1933-34:

Orthodox-Christian.—Schools, 682 (boys 200, girls 203, mixed 268, infants 11); pupils 42,610 (boys 24,230, girls 18,380); teachers 988 (masters 611, mistresses 377).

Moslem.—Schools, 264 (boys 43, girls 42, mixed 175, infants 4); pupils 10,495 (boys 6,240, girls 4,255); teachers 348 (masters 236, mistresses 112).

The total expenditure on education (primary and secondary) for the year 1934 was £73,962l., of which £25,056l. was from Colonial Revenue.

(b) Secondary.

There is a Moslem Lycée for boys and an intermediate school for girls in Nicosia, administered by a Governing Body constituted by law, and supported by Government and Evcaf grants and by fees.

There are 19 Orthodox-Christian secondary schools for boys,—5 Gymnasia (classical) in the towns and a Commercial Lyceum at Larnaca, managed by local committees appointed by law; and 7 high schools in the larger villages, managed by locally elected committees. These are supported mainly by fees and grants from municipal or Church funds. There are also private commercial schools at Nicosia (2), Limassol (2), and Famagusta, dependent upon fees, and one commercial school with private endowments.

There are 3 Orthodox-Christian secondary schools for girls, who are also admitted to most of the boys' secondary schools.

There are 3 important secondary schools open to all denominations—the English School, Nicosia, for boys, managed by trustees on the lines of an English grammar school; and the 2 American Academies (for boys and girls at Larnaca, for girls at Nicosia) managed by the Reformed Presbyterian Mission.

The 9 schools of the Armenian and Latin communities to some extent combine secondary with primary education.

The total enrolment in secondary schools is about 4,250.

The 2 Moslem secondary schools provide training for elementary school teachers and there is a teachers' training college attached to the Nicosia Gymnasium; these schools receive grants-in-aid for this purpose.

Most of the secondary schools are open to Government inspection of the teaching of English, for which they receive grants-in-aid. There are also small private schools for the teaching of English in several villages.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation.

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

The island was annexed to and became part of His Majesty's dominions by an Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914.

Government.

Up to the 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent, bearing date 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official Members and fifteen elected Members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and twelve by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island those clauses of the Letters Patent, dated 10th March, 1925, which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated the 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor.

The island, for administrative purposes, is divided into six districts namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Paphos. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

For judicial purposes it is divided into three judicial districts, namely the administrative districts of (1) Nicosia and Kyrenia, of (2) Famagusta and Larnaca, and of (3) Limassol and Paphos.

The Courts established by the Cyprus Courts of Justice Order, 1882 (as amended) and superseding those in existence at the time of the occupation, were reconstituted by an Order in Council which came into force on 1st October, 1927, and provides for:—

(1) A Supreme Court, consisting of five judges, two of whom are Christian and Moslem Cypriots respectively, and having power to hear criminal and civil appeals from the decisions of all other courts, including divisional courts of the Supreme Court.

(2) Three Divisional Courts consisting of one or two judges of the Supreme Court, as may be directed by the Chief Justice, and exercising the original jurisdiction conferred upon the Supreme Court to hear and determine (a) defended actions over £200 and (b) election petitions.

(3) Three District Courts, the personnel of each consisting of a President and (under the Cyprus Courts of Justice Amendment Order, 1931) such number of District Judges as the Governor shall from time to time direct. There are at present nine District Judges.
