ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. The province of Aden (the total area of which, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas:—Aden proper (area 21 square miles; population 34,471), on the south, and Little Aden (area 15 square miles) on the west—and a flat strip of coast, about three miles broad (area 39 square miles; population, including Sheikh Othman, Imad, and Hiswa, 12,167). The peninsulas form the horns of a bay called Aden Back Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. The native town of Aden is situated on the east of the Aden peninsula, opposite a gap in the crater walls. On the west side of the peninsula, some five miles from the town, is Steamer Point, off which the large steamers lie. The highest point of the peninsula is 1,725 feet above sea level. The average annual rainfall is about 3 inches, and the maximum is about 8 inches. The climate is very hot and damp, especially during the summer months.

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. The Aden peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchases in 1882 and 1888.

Aden is an important oil fuel and bunkering station, and also an entrepôt for the trade with Arabia. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc.

The Aden Protectorate, which comprises the Hadhramaut, covers an area of about 42,000 square miles and includes the territories of a number of Chiefs and tribes in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. The Resident and Commander-in-Chief deals with Protectorate matters under the direct control of His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies. It has a population of over 100,000.

The Aden Protectorate borders on the Arab State of the Yemen, with which there have been frequent frontier difficulties for several years. These were adjusted by a treaty signed at San'a (the capital of the Yemen) between His Majesty's Government and the King of the Yemen, on 11th February 1934, by the terms of which the status quo on the date of signature is to be preserved for the duration of the treaty, a period or 40 years. Prior to signature the King of the Yemen by mutual agreement, evacuated certain parts of the Protectorate which were in his occupation.

Administration.

The administration of Aden was formerly directly under the Government of Bombay, but new arrangements came into operation in 1928. The Imperial Government is now responsible for military and political affairs in Aden and the Aden Protectorate. The province of Aden itself remains under the Government of India. The financial settlement required by this division of authority provides for the payment by India to Imperial Revenues of £150,000 a year. This amount is considerably less than the annual expenditure falling upon Indian revenues under the former system of control.

The administrative control of the Settlement of Aden was transferred from the Bombay Government on 1st April, 1932, when Aden was formed into a separate province under the direct control of the Government of India.

The administration is vested in a Chief Commissioner who is also Resident and Commander-in-Chief. Since the introduction of the dual control referred to above, the Resident's post is to be held alternatively by an officer of the Indian Service and an officer of the Colonial Service. The Court of the Resident is the Colonial Court of Admiralty under Act XVI of 1891, and its procedure as such is regulated by the provisions of the Colonial Courts of the Admiralty Act 1890 (53 & 54 Vic. Chapter 27). The laws in force in the province of Aden are, generally speaking, those in force in India, supplemented on certain points by special regulations to suit local conditions. The management of the port is under the control of a Board of Trustees formed in 1888. The principal business of the Port Trust in recent years has been the deepening of the harbour so as to allow vessels of large size to enter and leave at all states of the tide. The police force, consisting of land, harbour and armed police, has recently been reorganised.

Aden is a free port and there is no customs tariff. Excise duty is, however, levied on spirits, wines and beer, perfumed spirits, intoxicating and dangerous drugs on specific duty basis.

**PERIM**, a bare rocky island, five square miles in area, with a population of 1,700, lies in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, about 1½ miles from the south-west corner of Arabia. It possesses a good harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth. It was occupied by the British in 1799, but subsequently abandoned, and was only re-occupied in 1857, when the overland route to India made the position important. It is a coaling, oil-fuel and cable station, and forms part of the province of Aden.

**SOCOTRA,** an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19'—12° 42' N. lat., and 53° 21'—53° 30' E. long, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the Government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Qishu, on the Arabian mainland, to whom it belongs. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 12,000. It is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kuri and Bromers Islands.

**TRISTAN DA CUNHA.**

Tristan da Cunha is the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6' S. long., 12° 2' W., about midway between South Africa and South America. It is an extinct volcano rising to 7,640 feet above sea level, with a crater-lake near its summit. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. When the garrison was withdrawn in 1817, William Glass, a corporal of artillery, and his wife elected to remain, and they were joined by two ex-Navy men, Alexander Cotton and John Mooney, and these, with certain ship-wrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement, which is on the north-west of the island, where there is a comparatively level area about 9 miles long and 1½ miles broad and about 100 feet above the sea. After some years, the five unmarried settlers contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885.

In November, 1933, the population numbered 167, all with the exception of 6 having been born in the island. 13 were over the age of 60, including one man aged 76 and one woman aged 94. The inhabitants are generally healthy, and are spoken of as moral, religious, and hospitable.

In the way of live stock, the inhabitants have between them about 170 head of cattle, about 600 sheep and a stock of poultry. Potatoes do well, and crops are got in annually. Potatoes form the staple article of diet. Fish of good quality is obtainable in plenty. During the nesting season penguin and albatross eggs are gathered. For flour, sugar, jam and other prepared or manufactured food the island is dependent upon passing ships. Despite the limited choice of diet no evidence of malnutrition or deficiency disease is observable. Apple trees are in fair number, and bear well; there are also a few fig trees, but they do not fruit. The tree of the island, which apparently is a juniper, and upon
which the islanders are dependent for their wood for fuel, is getting scarce in the neighbourhood of the settlement, but is abundant further off, and there is no fear of supply failing.

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel has from time to time maintained a clergyman in the island.

In January, 1904, the island was visited by H.M.S. "Odin" in order to ascertain whether the islanders would accept the offer of the Cape Government to settle them in the Cape Colony, but out of eleven families only three families elected to go. The islanders are liable from time to time to privations. In March, 1907, owing to information indicating probability of failure of supplies, relief was sent by His Majesty's Government by the "Greyhound," chartered at Cape Town. On this occasion also the inhabitants were unwilling to leave the island, and the Rev. J. G. Barrow, a clergyman who had gone to the island in April, 1906, reported that though there is sure to be privation from time to time, it does not cause absolute distress. (See correspondence presented to Parliament in Cd. 3098 and Cd. 3764.)

Arrangements are usually made for the island to be visited by a ship at least once a year.

January, February, and March are the best months for visiting the island. It is in these months that weather at times becomes so settled that the islanders are able to make visits to Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands, which are some 20 miles off. They also are often able to visit these islands in November to gather eggs, etc.
