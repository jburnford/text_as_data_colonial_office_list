WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.
The office of High Commissioner in over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.
The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.
The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.
Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.
The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners.
and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.**

The Colony, which includes Ocean, Christmas, Fanning, and Washington Islands, besides the Gilbert and Ellice groups, is under the charge of a Resident Commissioner, who is responsible to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific who resides in Fiji.

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE GROUPS.**—The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:—Makin, Butaritari, Marakei and Abaiang (Northern Gilberts); Tarawa, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Aranuka (Central Gilberts), Nonouti, Tabiteuea, Beru, Nikunau, Onotoa, Tamana, Arorae (Southern Gilberts). (The inclusion of Nonouti in the Southern Gilberts dates from the 1st July, 1935.)

The Ellice Islands are the following nine:—Nanumea, Nanumaga, Niutao, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Naurakita.

The two groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 11° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude with an area of 180 square miles. The principal export is copra.

The population of the Colony on the 31st December, 1934, was approximately as follows:—Ocean Island, 2,183; Northern Gilberts District, 6,957; Central Gilberts District (includes Nonouti), 8,416; Southern Gilberts District (excludes Nonouti), 12,285; Ellice Islands District, 4,221; Fanning Island District (figures not available). These figures may be divided into three broad groups: Europeans 238, Asiatics 360, and Natives 33,739. Total 34,337.

With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate.

A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.

**OCEAN ISLAND** (or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. Reaching a height of 280 ft. and covered with vegetation, it is the only island of the Colony not of atoll formation. The population of Ocean Island on the 31st December, 1934, was 2,183. Of these 127 were Europeans. The natives numbered 1,717. Indentured labourers with their wives and families numbered 787. There were also 339 Asiatics, all employees of the British Phosphates Commissioners with the exception of the Government Interpreter, his wife and amah, and one private resident.

**FANNING AND WASHINGTON ISLANDS** lie about 30° 51' N. latitude, and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. A Deputy Commissioner is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 28. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the Colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel of the Fanning Island Company. The population of Fanning Island at the 31st December, 1934, was 275. All labour was withdrawn from Washington Island during the year.

**CHRISTMAS ISLAND** (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut
Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell, and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. All vessels employed or chartered by the Company trading between the Society Islands and Christmas Island have been exempted from the Quarantine Ordinance, and may visit Christmas Island without a preliminary call at a prescribed port of entry in the Colony. Periodical visits are made by H.M.'s ships.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Communication between the various islands was formerly infrequent, depending on the irregular movements of vessels belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, Limited, On Chong and Company, and the British Phosphate Commissioners, but the acquisition by the Administration of the auxiliary sailing vessel "Nimanoa" has considerably increased the facilities for regular communication.

The principal sources of revenue are import duties (general ad valorem rate 25 per cent., British preferential ad valorem rate 12½ per cent.); export duty on copra; land tax (paid in copra) on native communities; capitation tax 10s. a head p.a. on non-natives; ship trading and other licences; royalty on phosphate shipped from Ocean Island; interest on invested funds and consolidated payment by the British Phosphate Commissioners. By virtue of the latter the Commissioners are exempted from certain taxation and duties.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

| Year ended 30th June | Revenue | Expenditure |
|----------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1930-31              | £63,704 | £61,453     |

| 1934-35              | 61,001  | 61,001      |

Estimated.

The imports and exports have been as follows:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|

| 1932-33 | 117,920 | 398,068 |
| 1933-34 | 94,429 | 259,843 |

Customs revenue during 1933-34 was 18,254l. from import and export duties. Legislation has now been enacted whereby a British Preferential Tariff has been introduced. Preferences range from 50 per cent. to 100 per cent.

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is situated between the parallels of 5° South and 12° 30' South, and the meridians of 155° and 170° of East longitude.

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands, extending at its extremities from Bougainville Straits to Mitre Island, in the Santa Cruz Group, for a distance of 900 miles, and north and south from the Ontong Java Group to Rennell Island for a distance of 430 miles, in an area approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,000 square miles are land.

The native population (mainly Melanesian) is 93,415.

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in the year 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. The island first sighted they named Ysabel because it was on that Saint's day that they left Callao. In the year 1595 a second expedition under Mendana sailed from Peru, but failed to locate the island of Guadalcanal, whereon it was intended he should form a settlement, and he arrived in the Santa Cruz Group, and landed at Graciosa Bay. The new colony proved a failure, the death of Mendana put an end to any prospect of success, and the remnants of the original party returned to Peru.

In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz Group and the north-west coast line of the island of Malaita.

In the same year de Bougainville in the frigate La Boudicce, sailed from Monte Video on a deliberate quest of the Terra Australis which he missed, and arrived at New Guinea; in sailing back he passed through the Straits which are the present north-eastern boundary of the Protectorate, the island on the right being named Bougainville after him, and the one on the left named after Choiseul, who was at the time Minister of France.

Twenty years later, and 700 miles to the southeast, la Perouse, in command of the French frigates L'Astrolabe and La Bousole, on a voyage of discovery, was wrecked at Pion on the island of Vanikoro. His fate was unknown for 40 years.

From this time, many Europeans visited the Group, and British ships-of-war paid periodical visits.

In 1860 natives were recruited to work on plantations in Queensland and Fiji. The recruiting for Queensland ceased in 1903 and most of the natives were repatriated.

Recruiting for Fiji continued until 1910.

Between the years 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the Proclamation in 1893 of the British Protectorate over the Southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristoval, the New Georgia Group and its Dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50.

In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz Group, including Utupua, Tucopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona, were added to the Protectorate, and in 1900 the Northern Islands, namely, Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits, south and south-east of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ontong Java, were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

The population of the Protectorate in April, 1935, was:

| Race          | Number |
|---------------|--------|
| Europeans     | 478    |
| Native (Melanesian) | 89,568 |
| Native (Polynesian) | 3,847 |
| Chinese       | 192    |
| Japanese      | 8      |
| Malays        | 1      |

Total: 94,094

The climate of the Solomon Islands, owing to the prevalence of malaria, is not healthy, but the conditions of living have been greatly improved during recent years and the possibilities of good health during temporary residence have been enormously increased.

Generally speaking, the seasons are well defined by the trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the lowest minimum temperature is recorded, and the highest mean and maximum temperatures are, as a rule, recorded in the months from November to April which is commonly known as the north-west season.

The rainfall varies considerably from month to month and year to year, though the average rainfall, recorded at Tulagi, is approximately 120 inches a year.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed in Tulagi) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific (who resides in Suva, Fiji).

There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of King's Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

There is an Advisory Council, consisting of the Resident Commissioner and not more than seven members, three of whom may be officials.

The Protectorate is divided up into eight administrative areas, each under a District Officer. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The Customs Tariff consists of duties at specific or ad valorem rates on certain imports and exports and includes provisions for Empire preferences.

Percentage of Trade with the United Kingdom: 15·30%

Percentage of Trade with other parts of the British Empire: 62·32%

TONGA.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, with an area of about 250 square miles, are situated between the 18th and 22nd degrees of south latitude. They were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most of the islands are of coral formation, but some are volcanic, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand and Samoa. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. There is monthly communication by steamer with Auckland. Passengers, goods, and mails from other countries tranship, as a rule, at Suva. During the dry season, i.e., from April to December, steamers call at regular intervals for copra freights.

Census of Population, April, 1934:

| Population       |        |
|------------------|--------|
| Europeans        | 378    |
| Half-castes      | 475    |
| Other Pacific Islanders | 206 |
| Others           | 48     |
| Tongans          | 30,482 |
| Total            | 31,589 |

In 1845 George Tubou I, who was the first to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, was proclaimed King. The present Ruler is assisted by a Parliament and a Privy Council. The Privy Council is composed of two European and six Native Ministers of the Crown who are also heads of the various government departments. The civil service is composed mostly of Tongans, the European officials numbering about 24. The general tariff is 20% ad valorem and British preferential 12½% ad valorem.

Year. Imports. Exports.

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1930 | 148,306 | 169,610 |
| 1931 | 91,170  | 90,596  |
| 1932 | 86,006  | 96,163  |
| 1933 | 86,007  | 114,147 |
| 1934 | 48,526  | 77,842  |

The imports, apart from oils and drapery, are of Empire origin. The following figures show the percentage of imports from foreign countries:

| Year | Per Cent. |
|------|-----------|
| 1930 | 12        |
| 1931 | 12        |
| 1932 | 14        |
| 1933 | 23-37     |
| 1934 | 14        |

Of the rest of the imports during 1934 the United Kingdom supplied 17·09 per cent., New Zealand 22·30 per cent., Australia 21·28 percent, and other British possessions 20·56 per cent.

The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are seven churches in Tonga, viz., the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, with about 17,236 adherents; the Free Church of Tonga, and the Church of Tonga, with about 8,717; the Roman Catholic Mission, with about 3,671; the Church of England, 178; the Church of Latter Day Saints, 539; and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, with about 260 adherents.

The Wesleyan Mission was first founded in Tonga in the year 1826, and a few years later the chiefs and people embraced Christianity and became members of the Church. The control and management of the Mission in Tonga were entrusted about the year 1857 to the Australasian Conference and continued until the year 1883, when King George Tubou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded, with a large majority of his chiefs and people and, with the assistance of the Rev. Shirley Baker, established the Wesleyan Free Church of Touga as a separate and independent body though retaining the same doctrines, discipline, and form of worship as the Wesleyan Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakagogo," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylartst Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakago" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

In the year 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church, and an enquiry that was held into the state of the finances disclosed a very lax state of affairs. As a result of this enquiry it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies as a separate and independent Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. At a joint conference of the two churches held in April, 1924, union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. A. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued as a result of this division in respect of the ownership of the churches an...
property of the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga established by King George I in 1885. It was finally decided on appeal in favour of the united Church, of which the present Queen is the head.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917 to Prince Uliame Tugi, the present Premier, and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed on 18th May, 1900.

The present premier, Uliame Tugi, is the Prince Consort, and was formerly Minister for Lands. The progress of Tonga since 1905 has been satisfactory.

Every Tongan is entitled to an allotment of land for cultivation, so that no unemployment exists. Primary education for Tongans between the ages of 6 and 14 is compulsory. There are two boys' colleges at which provision is made for secondary education. Secondary education of girls is entirely in the hands of the Christian missions. Medical work is well organised; and, unlike most native communities in the Pacific, the native population steadily increases in number.

British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment exceeding two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga Courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner. Licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British and Australian sterling.

Arrangements were made in 1919 for the issue of Tongan Government Treasury notes. At the end of 1934, 4s., 10s., 1l., and 5l. notes were in circulation to the value of 21,268l. The issue is secured by an investment reserve.

There are no private banks in the Kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1934 there were 1,199 depositors and 24,803l. in deposits.

Statistics.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 168th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 sq. miles, and the population under 3,000.

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, Seventh Day Adventists and Church of Christ, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church.

The principal exports are copra, cocoa, cotton, coffee, trochus; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914 to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 18th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium Staff working in Departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners.

The Customs Tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

Of the import trade of the group about two-thirds is claimed by Australia and the remainder by France and foreign countries, while the bulk of the exports are shipped to France.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 136° 8' E. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island: but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population numbers 200 persons.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, R. E. Christian.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
