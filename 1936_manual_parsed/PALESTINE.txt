PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the States of Syria and the Lebanon, which are under French Mandate, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian province of Sinai (the boundary running from a point west of Rafa on the Mediterranean to a point two miles to the west of where the thalweg of the Wadi Araba joins the Gulf of Aqaba) and on the east by Trans-Jordan, which is included in the area of the Palestine Mandate.

The boundary on the north was determined by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920, (Comd. 1195) and in pursuance of that Convention was delimited between the Mediterranean and El Hamme in 1922. The Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government giving effect to the delimitation is published as Cmd. 1910 (Treaty Series No. 13 (1923)).

The frontier runs from the Mediterranean at Ras al Nakura eastwards to Yarun, thence N.E. to the village of Qadis, thence N.N.E. to Metullah and across the Jordan Valley to Tel Al Qadi (in Palestine) and Banias (in Syria), thence S.S.W. to Jisr Banat Yaqub, thence southwards along the Jordan to the Lake of Tiberias, thence along the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias to a point almost due east of the town of Tiberias, thence S.S.E. to El Hamme Station on the Hejaz railway.

The frontier with Trans-Jordan is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of Aqaba on the Gulf of Aqaba up the centre of the Wadi Araba, the Dead Sea and the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmuk, thence up the centre of the River Yarmuk to the Syrian frontier.

The Natural Divisions of Palestine.

Palestine comprises four zones of country:

(a) The hill country of Galilee and Judaea,
(b) The five plains, including that lying in the rift of the Jordan Valley, which, from the north of Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea, is actually below the level of the Mediterranean,
(c) the Beersheba area, different in character and population from the rest of the country,
(d) the desert area.

The five plains are:—The Acre Plain, the Plain of Esdraelon, the Huleh Plain, the Coastal Plain and the Plain of the Jordan.

Geology.

The Hill Country is composed principally of limestone which provides excellent building stone of various types and colours. Calcareous sandstone abounds along the coast and was used by the Crusaders for their maritime forts and castles (Atlit and Acre); the new Haifa breakwater has been constructed of a similar stone from Atlit. Of metallic minerals, copper ores and important deposits of manganese occur in the southern part of Palestine near the Gulf of Akaba. Petroleum and bitumen exudations are found around the southern part of the Dead Sea. This region and the area westward as far as the Mediterranean Sea is now being explored by Oil Companies. Of non-metallic ores, rock phosphate and bituminous limestone occur in large deposits on the slopes of the Judean Wilderness. Rock salt occurs in unlimited quantity in the salt dome of Jebel Usdum and has been used for the supply of the Jerusalem market. A sulphur deposit of commercial importance has been located south of Gaza. A plant for treatment and concentration of the sulphur in the ore has now been installed. A good quality of gypsum is found at Menahemiya near Tiberias and impure varieties are found on the slopes of the Judean Wilderness. Extensive deposits of anhydrite (anhydrous gypsum) occur overlying the rock salt at Jebel Usdum.

The production of potassium chloride and bromine by Palestine Potash Ltd. shows a substantial increase and the market has now become world wide. Large evaporating basins have now been constructed at the south end of the Dead Sea. Pumps have been erected and production on a large scale is expected in 1936. There are hot springs of medicinal value at Tiberias and El Hamme where bathing establishments on modern lines have been erected for the treatment of patients and, in addition, at El Hamme large baths for pleasure bathing and swimming in the waters of varying tepid temperatures are provided.

Climate.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude: the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated, hilly zone is drier and more temperate, while the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are, in general, the wettest months and the main rainfall occurs between November and April. The rainfall varies largely, from a minimum of 24 inches in the south to a maximum of 31 inches in the north.
Water for domestic use is obtained in the larger towns from piped supplies; in the smaller towns and rural districts, from rock cisterns in which rain water is collected or from small springs or wells.

Malaria which was formerly very prevalent has now been eradicated from the large towns and in rural areas a very marked reduction in incidence has been effected as a result of various large drainage schemes, anti-larval control, as well as by mass treatment of the population in those areas where the incidence of the disease was very high. One or two highly endemic areas remain to be dealt with on a permanent basis.

Epidemic diseases are not unduly prevalent.

Jerusalem Water Supply.

Jerusalem has a piped supply of water, pumped partly from a southern group of sources at Arrub and Solomon's Pools by an installation made by the Military Authorities and the Civil Administration and partly from an eastern group of springs of Ain Farah, Ain Fawar and Wadi Kelt by plants constructed by the Municipality in 1926, 1931 and 1932.

The quantity of water now pumped to Jerusalem from these sources is approximately 450,000 gallons per day from the eastern sources and an average of 180,000 gallons per day from the southern sources. The supply from the southern group of the sources is irregular, as they consist partly of surface water stored in Solomon's and Arrub Pools and partly of spring water.

In 1932 and 1933 a new town service reservoir was built with a capacity of 2,200,000 gallons. A second reservoir with the same capacity is now under construction.

A new scheme for the supply of water to Jerusalem from the Ras-el-Ain Springs (a distance of 60 kilometres from Jerusalem) has been under construction for the last two years and will be completed in 1936.

It is hoped that with the installation of the new water scheme, a quantity of over one million gallons will be delivered daily to meet the increased water consumption in the City.

Government.

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet (Province) of Beirut and part in the Sandjak (District) of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

By the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Palestine. The Principal Allied Powers had selected His Britannic Majesty as Mandatory at the Conference at San Remo, on 25th April, 1920. The terms of the Mandate were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th July, 1922, and the Mandate came into force on September 29th, 1923. The Mandatory is responsible, inter alia, for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, viz.:—"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

On the 1st September, 1922, a Constitution was promulgated.

Under this Constitution Palestine is governed by a High Commissioner, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, assisted by an Executive Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Treasurer; and by an Advisory Council consisting of heads of certain Departments.

An attempt was made in 1923 to create the Legislative Council provided for in the Constitution, but owing to the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections, it was replaced by the Advisory Council in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as a Legislative Council is created.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

In 1921, a Supreme Moslem Council was constituted in order to control and manage Moslem Awqaf and Sharia Courts in Palestine. It consists of a President known also as Rais-Al-Ulema, and four members elected by secondary electors, who again are elected by all male Palestinian Moslems over 20 years of age. The Council nominates for approval by Government the officers of the Sharia Courts and appoints the Awqaf officers.

The Council has established a Moslem Orphanage in Jerusalem, and has carried out important repairs of sacred buildings and extensive tree planting on Waqf land and in Moslem cemeteries.

Regulations were made under the Religious Communities Ordinance, 1928, by the High Commissioner in 1927 for the organisation of the Jewish Community in Palestine. The Jewish community, like the Moslem and the various Christian communities enjoys autonomy in the administration of its internal affairs, religious, cultural and communal; it has also power to levy rates on its members. The organs of the community are a Chief Rabbinate and local Rabbinical offices, an Elected Assembly, a General Council which is elected by the Assembly and represents the community in its dealings with the Government, and local communities.

Complete freedom in their communal affairs is allowed to those Jewish congregations who have exercised the option to remain outside the recognised community.

The Jewish Agency is recognized as the representative body of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home; it is represented in Palestine by an Executive whose headquarters are at Jerusalem.

The Palestine Government has maintained in force the status and privileges accorded to the different Christian Communities under the Ottoman regime.

The affairs of the towns are administered by Municipal Councils presided over by Mayors. In large villages Local Councils have been set up.

District Town Planning Commissions are now replacing the Central Town Planning Commission and will deal with the town planning projects in their areas put forward by Municipal Town Planning Committees and Rural Committees. A Town Planning Adviser who is ex officio member of all the District Town Planning Commissions is attached to the office of the Attorney-General.

Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into three districts—the Jerusalem, Northern and Southern Districts—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is nearly 10,000 square miles in extent. The population of this territory taken by Census on November 18th, 1931, was 1,035,821, of which number 387,525 were living in 23 towns and large
villages and 66,553 were nomad beduin. An estimate of the settled population at 30.6.36 based on natural increase and excess of immigration is 1,194,500 of whom 874,100 are non-Jews and 320,400 are Jews. To this must be added the nomad beduin population (Moslem) about whom no figures are available except those given in the Census of 1931 (66,553). The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population in 1931 was 90,503. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The population figures of the other principal towns at the date of the Census (18.11.31) were:— Jaffa, 51,886; Tel-Aviv, 46,101; Haifa, 50,403; Gaza, 17,046; Nazareth, 8,758; Nablus, 17,189; Safad, 9,441; Tiberias, 8,601; Hebron, 17,631; Ramle, 10,347; Bethlehem, 6,814; Lydda, 11,250; Acre, 7,897.

Jewish Colonisation.

The total Jewish population of Palestine is estimated to be about 356,000 (October, 1936). Jewish agricultural settlements number 170 and have a population of over 78,000. Eighty-five of them are built on the land of the Jewish National Fund, established by the Zionist Organisation for the purpose of acquiring land to remain the property of the Jewish people. (The total possessions of the Jewish National Fund now amount to 350,000 metric dunams.) These settlements have been equipped and financed by the Karen Hayesod, the Colonisation Fund of the Jewish Agency. During 1921-34 the Keren Hayesod invested £5,216,000 out of which £1,625,000 were on agriculture, £1,005,000 on education, £1,019,000 on urban colonization and £482,000 on labour and immigration.

Extensive colonisation work has been performed by the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association, which took over colonies established by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and established new settlements, the total being about 30.

A number of settlements have been founded on the land acquired by private Companies and individuals. The total area in Jewish possession is now over 1,250,000 metric dunams, of which 140,000 are planted with oranges and grape fruits.

The Jewish urban population is approximately 277,000, its main centres being:—Jerusalem and suburbs 70,000, Tel-Aviv (a purely Jewish city) 137,000, Haifa 42,000 and Jaffa 18,000. There are about 4,000 Jewish factories and workshops employing 25,000 owners and workers and representing a total capital investment of £P.6,500,000 with a total annual output of £P.6,000,000; over two-thirds of these were established after the war.

The Jewish community of Palestine is organised under the Communities Ordinance and is represented by the General Council, (Vaad Leumi) which controls the Hebrew School system and the Health services. Over 70,000 Jewish workers are organised in the General Federation of Jewish Labour which controls a wide system of cooperative activities.

The British Government and Palestine Administration recognise the Jewish Agency (consisting both of Zionists and non-Zionists) which in Palestine is represented by a local executive as the Agency of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the development of the Jewish National Home.

Education.

The approximate number of children in Palestine between the ages of 3 and 18 years was in 1931 307,000, of whom 231,000 were Moslems, 49,000 Jews and 27,000 Christians. The number of children who attended school in 1933-34 was 102,996, including 40,088 Moslems, 44,829 Jews, 17,454 Christians and 625 Druzes and Bahais.

The Arab Public System of Education, maintained by Government, embraced in that school year 320 schools with 30,842 pupils, the great majority of whom were Moslems. The schools included 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 67 men and 61 women students, and 11 schools with 17 secondary classes containing 198 secondary pupils. In 1934-35 there were 360 schools with 35,965 pupils in the Arab Public System. The Kadoorie Agricultural School at Tulkarm had 44 boarders. This school also provides agricultural training for teachers in rural schools and some of its students are trained in it for teaching in rural schools. Technical education is provided in most of the larger schools. The Law School in Jerusalem had 163 students.

The Jewish and Christian Communities provide, the former almost entirely and the latter to a very large extent, for the education of their own children.

The Hebrew Public System, controlled by the General Council (Vaad Leumi) of the Jewish Community of Palestine, embraced 291 schools with 28,223 pupils. These included 4 Teachers' Training Colleges with 98 men and 268 women students, and 7 schools with 30 secondary classes containing 1,121 secondary pupils. There were also 176 private Jewish schools with 17,347 pupils, including 6 secondary schools with 609 pupils. In 1934-35 there were 317 schools with 33,871 pupils in the Hebrew Public System.

There were 7 Jewish Agricultural schools with 803 pupils, 5 junior technical schools with 199 students and a Technical Institute at Haifa with 181 students. The Hebrew University at Jerusalem had 254 students and 16 auditors. The Hebrew Kadoorie Agriculture School which was opened at Mount Tabor in the summer, 1934, had 28 boarders.

The Christian schools, maintained by various foreign and religious bodies, numbered 148, with 17,347 pupils. 30 of these schools had 92 secondary classes with 909 pupils; the 3 agricultural schools had 58 pupils. There were about 40 schools from which Attendance Returns were not received; the number of pupils in these schools was estimated at 2,500.

There were 74 private Moslem schools maintained by private persons and associations, with 6,326 boys and 1,419 girls. There were also 100 kuttab. These provided for 3,162 children, of whom 92 were girls.

Some non-Government Schools receive a capitation grant-in-aid from the Department of Education, conditional on the acceptance of a certain measure of Government supervision and inspection. A block grant of £P.25,254 was made to the Jewish Community of Palestine for its schools for the scholastic year 1933-34.

The Palestine Board of Higher Studies was established in 1924. The Government and many educational institutions are represented on it. It conducts the Palestine Matriculation Examination and the Palestine Diploma Examination, both of which are public examinations recognised by Government. The Palestine Matriculation Examination is recognised by many British Universities.
Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are, insofar as Civil matters are concerned, either civil or religious Courts. The former have jurisdiction over all persons and all matters, subject to certain reservations in favour of the religious Courts as provided in the Palestine Order-in-Council, 1922, and subject to the provisions of local Ordinances defining the jurisdiction of the various Courts.

There is a Magistrate's Court in each sub-district and in the larger towns such as Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Tel Aviv, two or more such Courts. The majority of the Magistrates are Palestinians. They have jurisdiction in first instance in criminal cases for which they may award punishment of not more than one year's imprisonment or a fine of one hundred pounds or both. In the larger towns there are British Magistrates who have power to award punishment up to two years imprisonment or a fine of two hundred pounds or both. In civil cases the jurisdiction of Palestinian Magistrates extends to cases where the subject matter of the action does not exceed £P. 150 and that of British Magistrates extends to £P. 250. Jurisdiction in regard to counterclaims arising out of the same subject matter as the original action is not limited. The Magistrates' Courts have also jurisdiction to entertain actions for recovery of possession or partition of immovable property.

There are four District Courts, each composed of a British Resident and two Palestinian Judges. Civil Actions in which the subject matter does not exceed £P. 500 are triable by two Judges, unless the parties agree to the action being tried by one Judge. Civil actions in which the subject matter exceeds £P. 500 are triable by the President and one Judge. Criminal cases upon information are tried by three Judges, the Presiding Judge being a British Judge. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance over all crimes except those punishable with death, and in all civil cases outside the jurisdiction of a Magistrate. With the exception of actions for recovery of possession of immovable property, the District Courts may entertain appeals decisions of Magistrates in civil and criminal cases. The District Courts may try persons charged with offences for which the maximum penalty does not exceed three years imprisonment and a fine of £P. 300, in a summary manner. For such trials the District Court is constituted of two judges, the Presiding Judge being a British Judge. An accused person whether triable upon information or summarily may apply to be tried by a British Judge sitting alone.

When any person is charged with an offence other than a petty offence, he may claim to be tried by a British Magistrate or by the District Court.

Crimes punishable with death are tried by a Court of Criminal Assize composed of the Chief Justice or a British Puisne Judge and two other Judges, of whom one must be a British Judge. The Accused may however elect for trial by a British Judge of the Supreme Court sitting alone.

In each District there is a Land Court composed of two judges, the Presiding Judge being a British Judge, which hears cases relating to ownership of land, and appeals from Magistrates' Courts in actions for recovery of land and from decisions of Land Settlement Officers.

The Highest Court in Palestine is the Supreme Court which is composed of a British Chief Justice, one British Judge and four Palestinian Judges. The Court sits in two capacities:

(1) As a Court of Appeal, in which capacity it has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided in first instance by the District Courts, the Land Courts and the Court of Criminal Assize. As a Court of Civil Appeal it is constituted of two Judges.

As a Court of Criminal Appeal, the Court is ordinarily constituted of three Judges, two of whom are British Judges.

(2) As a High Court of Justice, in which capacity it hears applications of the nature of habeas corpus and mandamus proceedings. For this purpose the Court is constituted of two Judges. In every case a British Judge presides. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court in civil matters to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council where the value of the suit exceeds £P. 500.

The Chief Justice of Palestine is ex officio a member of the Full Court of Appeal of Egypt.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba sub-district, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Kadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moslem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Jews, and jurisdiction by consent in other matters. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish religious Courts lies to the Rabbinical Council.

The different Christian communities (such as the Latin and Orthodox) have similar jurisdiction to that of the Jewish Courts.

Security.

The Police and Prisons establishment in December, 1934, was 160 Officers (including 59 British Officers) and 2,587 other ranks (including 675 British N.C.O.'s and Constables). 1,120 serious offences against persons property were reported in 1934 and eleven death sentences were carried out.

There are Central Prisons in Jerusalem and Acre for long-term prisoners, and a Female Prison in Bethlehem. There are also two Jail Labour Companies of approximately 350 each, the prisoners of which are employed on public works.

The garrison in Palestine and Trans-Jordan in 1934 consisted of the following units:

Air Headquarters Palestine and Trans-Jordan (Jerusalem), which administers the following Army, Royal Air Force and Trans-Jordan Frontier Force units:

Army:
Two Battalions of Infantry, one stationed at Jerusalem and one at Haifa.
One W/T Company, Royal Corps of Signals.
One Company, R.A.S.C.
Detachment R.A.M.C.

Royal Air Force:
Two Squadron (Day Bomber) Aircraft.

(Note.—The H.Q. and two Flights of one squadron are stationed in Egypt.)

One Armoured Car Company.
Meteorological Station, Amman and Ramleh.
R.A.F. Supply Depot, Sarafand.
R.A.F. General Hospital, Sarafand.
Combined Supply Depot, Sarafand (R.A.S.C. and R.A.F.)

Trans-Jordan Frontier Force.
Regimental Headquarters.
Mechanical Transport Troop, Attached to Regimental Headquarters.
Workshops,
Depot Training Cadre.
Three Squadrons Cavalry.
Two mechanised companies.
Six Troops Reserve (Dismounted).
Industry and Trade.

The principal industries of export importance are those of the cultivation of citrus fruits in the Southern District and the district round Haifa, soap-boiling in Nablus, Jaffa and Haifa; wine and brandy making, especially in the Jewish settlements, Zikhron-Ya'acov, Rishon-le-Zion and Petah-Tikvah; olive oil in Nablus, Acre, Haifa and the district round Jaffa. Hosiery, fancy leather goods, and a variety of other articles are exported to Syria and other neighbouring countries. Durrah, lentils, sesamese, barley and olive oils are also exported, but this largely depends on favourable climatic conditions.

Oranges, and grape fruit, are exported to the United Kingdom and Europe, exports during 1934 amounting to 5,648,211 cases valued at £P2,650,242. The area under citrus cultivation continues to increase.

Melons are exported mainly to Egypt and Syria.

The principal imports are rice, flour, sugar, petroleum products, textiles, building materials, automobiles, industrial machinery, dairy products, chemical fertilizers and animals for slaughtering.

There is a considerable number of small factories and workshops, including flour mills; factories for soap, brick and tile, knitted goods, textile, artificial teeth, iron and wood furniture, matches; oil mills cigarettes, fruit juice, edible oils. Of the larger industries, a cement factory produces over 200,000 tons annually, 14 tobacco and cigarette factories produce some 20,000 kilos of cut tobacco, 640,000 kilos of cigarettes, 75,000 kilos of tomback and 7,000 kilos of snuff, and 1,000 kilos of cigars, 14 wine presses and 17 distilleries produce some 2,379,000 litres of wine, 203,000 litres of cognac, 246,000 litres of arak and 647,000 litres of other spirits, and an oil factory produces several thousand tons of edible oil.

The Hydro-electric Power Station of the Palestine Electric Corporation at Jiar Mejamie now supplies current for light and power to Haifa, Tiberias, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nazareth and many rural centres. The Palestine Electric Corporation has in addition constructed a 1,800 k.w. steam driven station in the Haifa-Acre Bay near Haifa. The Jerusalem Electric and Public Service Corporation serves Jerusalem and its environs, including Ramallah and Bethlehem.

Agricultural and Forestry.

Modern methods are making headway and hold out hopes of development and progress. The country is generally fertile, and cereals, wine, oranges, grape fruit and lemons, olives and various fruits are produced, while sheep and goats thrive in the lowlands and in the mountains.

For the most part the crops are raised without irrigation, except where springs exist and in the eastern portion of the Plain of Esdraelon.

There are generally two crops harvested each year—the cereal and leguminous crop in May to June and a summer crop in August and September.

The yields of the main crops in 1932 to 1934 were:

| Year | Metric tons |
|------|-------------|
| 1932 | 51,073      |

(Export)

No Livestock Enumeration was taken in 1933.

In 1934 there were in Palestine:

- Horses: 16,355
- Mules: 7,481
- Donkeys: 75,784
- Camels: 32,033
- Cattle: 135,344
- Sheep: 188,267
- Goats: 380,517
- Poultry: 1,510,518

Eleven Government forests nurseries were maintained during 1934 and produced approximately 1,313,000 forest plants. Planting, begun in 1920, is being considerably extended. By the end of 1934 Government had planted 4,500 acres. Special attention is being given to the reclamation of sand dunes. Nearly 175,000 acres of state forests have been reserved.

Government Agricultural and Horticultural Experiment Stations have been organised at Acre, Beisan, Nablus, Jerusalem, Jericho, Sarafand, Farradieh (near Safad) and Majdal (near Gaza). The Acre Station also includes a Stud Farm.

Customs.

The Customs Tariff, which is non-differential, is fixed partly on a specific and partly on an ad valorem basis: 65% to 70% of imports pay specific charges, principally petrol, kerosene, sugar, rice, wheat, flour, leaf tobacco, cigarettes, wood and timber for building, and furniture, rubber tyres and tubes, boots and shoes, motor cars, silk tissues, cotton piece goods. Ad valorem duties are levied on woollen cloth (12%), toilet preparations (25%), stationery (12%).

The revenue from import duties in 1934 was £P2,429,526.

19-64% of imports came from the United Kingdom, 3-47% from other parts of the British Empire, 7-18% from Syria, 10-95% from Germany, 8-47% from U.S.A., 6-29% from Roumania, 4-08% from Belgium and 3-92% from Japan.

Exports to the United Kingdom constituted 55-48% of the total exports in 1934, to other parts of the British Empire 2-48%, to Germany 18-67%, to Syria 6-92%, to Egypt 2-19%, and to Holland 2-41%.

Shipping and Communications.

The chief ports of Palestine are Haifa and Jaffa. The new harbour at Haifa, started in 1929, was completed in 1933, and adequate facilities for ordinary passenger and cargo vessels, both at moorings and alongside the new quays, with transit sheds, road, railway and other services, have been provided.

Acre and Gaza are also ports of entry, but their trade is small and is carried mainly by sailing vessels.

The following are the principal shipping lines which call at Haifa and Jaffa:

- Khedivial Mail Line, Lloyd Triestino (Fiorelliunite Lloyd Triestino, Marittima Italiana e Sitmar), Messageries Maritimes, Royal Netherland S.S. Co., Prince Line Co. Ltd., Ellerman, Papayani Lines Ltd., Moss Line Co. Ltd., Elder Dempster & Co. Ltd., Anglo Saxon Petroleum Co., Deutsche Levant Linie, Svenska Orient Line, American Export Line, Moris Benin Fabre Line, Armenter L. Dens & Co., Sovtorg Flot, Bulgarian Steamship Co., United Levant Lines, Hellenic Coast Lines Co. Ltd., Service Maritime Rumanie, National Steam Navig. Co. Ltd. of Greece, Ellerman Wilson Line, Polish Palestine Line, Lauritzen Line, G. & T. Mabro, Orient Shipping Line Co.

In 1934, 1,084 steamers, totalling 4,284,571 tons, and 1,731 sailing vessels, totalling 62,313 tons, called at Palestine ports.
Two passenger steam vessels and one cargo motor vessel fly the Palestine flag.

Postal despatches are exchanged daily (in some cases thrice daily) between all principal towns. There is also a daily exchange of despatches with Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan. Direct mails for Great Britain are despatched four times weekly by ordinary mail and four times weekly by air mail. An air mail is despatched daily to Egypt.

There is a bi-weekly overland desert mail service with Iraq and Persia. On Monday via Jerusalem and Amman and on Tuesday via Haifa and Mafraq.

Imperial Airways have an aerodrome at Gaza which is used in connection with the air mail services to and from Great Britain, Iraq and India.

All the principal towns are connected by telegraph and telephone. There is direct telegraphic communication with Cyprus, Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan, and a trunk telephone service with Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Trans-Jordan. The trunk service with Egypt affords radio-telephonic facilities with Great Britain, and with all other countries connected thereto.

In 1934 there were conveyed 21,484,100 letters, 2,081,300 postcards, 12,691,900 printed communications and samples, 196,619 parcels, 399,000 telegrams were transmitted. Total length of main telegraph and telephone lines, 14,216 kilometres; local lines, 25,486 kilometres. Number of telephone subscribers 4,773; telephone instruments in use, 8,243.

The total length of the Palestine Railways, including branch lines and sidings, is approximately 723 miles, as follows:

The Kantara-Rafa Section is operated by the Palestine Railways on behalf of His Majesty's Government.

There is through communication with Egypt, and trains connect at Kantara West daily with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez and other parts of Egypt. Goods vehicles are sent across the canal by means of a truck transporter.

Sentinel-Cammell Steam Rail Cars are in use on the Lydda-Khan Yunis, Haifa-Acre and Haifa-Samakh Sections.

East of Haifa the Palestine Railways Administration extends to Ma'an in Trans-Jordan, but with a break between Samakh and Nassib which is operated by the Chemins de fer du Hedjaz authorities.

There are 650 miles of roads in Palestine suitable for motor traffic in all weather and in addition over a thousand miles of seasonal track passable for wheel traffic of all kinds.

Banking, Co-operative and Currency.

The most important bank in Palestine is Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Nazareth, and agencies at Acre, Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road North (Tel-Aviv), Ramat Gan, Gaza and Hebron. The Anglo-Palestine Bank has its head office at Tel-Aviv with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad, Petah-Tikvah, Hodera and Behovoth. In addition there are branches in Jerusalem of the Ottoman Bank (also in Haifa, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nablus and Amman), and the Banco di Roma (also in Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv, and an agency in Jerusalem). There is a Workers' Bank at Tel-Aviv and Banks have been established for granting building loans to Co-operative Societies.

The co-operative movement is extensively established among the Jewish population, both urban and rural. There is a Registrar of Co-operative Societies whose duties include the encouragement of the growth of a similar movement among the Arab farmers.

A Currency Board was appointed in London in 1926 in order to introduce and control a Palestine currency based on the pound sterling; and the new currency was issued on the 1st November, 1927, under the authority of an Order of His Majesty in Council dated the 7th of February, 1927.

The standard of currency is the Palestine pound, divided into 1,000 mils. The Palestine Currency Order provides for a gold coin of one Palestine pound containing 123·27447 grains of standard gold (the equivalent of the English sovereign). It is not intended at present to introduce gold coins. The Currency Board has issued silver coins of 100 and 50 mils, nickel bronze coins of 20, 10 and 5 mils, bronze coins of 2 and 1 mils, and currency notes of £P.100, £P.50, £P.10, £P.5, £P.1 and 500 mils. The currency notes are legal tender for the amounts expressed therein. Silver coins are legal tender for the payment of £P.2, nickel bronze coins of 20 and 10 mils are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 200 mils, and coins of lower denomination are legal tender for an amount not exceeding 100 mils. The amount of Palestine currency in circulation at the 30th September, 1935, was:—Coins, £P.595,320; notes, £P.6,924,814, 500 mils.

The metric system is followed by the Government and local authorities, but the use of local weights and measures is still permitted for the general public.

Antiquities.

The administration of the Antiquities Service in Palestine is controlled by the Department of Antiquities, working under the Antiquities Ordinance (1929) and Regulations (1930-32). During 1934, twenty licences to excavate or make soundings were issued. The results of the Department's research work, together with summaries of the results of licensed excavations conducted by non-Government bodies, are published in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. (Published by Mr. Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, London, E.C.4.)

The Department of Antiquities is housed in a building known as the Palestine Archaeological Museum, the construction and equipment of which were made possible by funds contributed by Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Junior.

For further information on all the above subjects see the "Handbook of Palestine" (Luke, H. C., and Keith-Roach, E.), published in 1930 by Macmillan and Co., and issued under the authority of the Government of Palestine, the Annual Blue Books of the Palestine Government, obtainable from the Superintendent of Printing and Stationery, Jerusalem, and the Annual Reports on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, published by His Majesty's Stationery Office.
