FEDERATED MALAY STATES.

The Federated Malay States comprise four States: Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang.

Perak.

Perak is ruled by a dynasty that claims descent from the last Malay Sultan of Malacca. In the 17th century it was overrun by the Acheenes, and at some time after 1636 a Johore prince, the husband of a Perak princess, was sent by Acheh to rule it under the title of Sultan Mudzaffar Shah. From 1650 onwards the Dutch endeavoured to get a monopoly of the tin exported from Perak, establishing near the mouth of the Perak river several factories, which the Malays, from time to time, cut off and destroyed. In 1765 the Sultan made a treaty with the Dutch.

British influence began early in the 19th century. A treaty with Penang in 1818 secured to Britian subjects the right to free trade in Perak. In 1825 a British arbitrator settled the boundary between Perak and Selangor. By the Burney Treaty with Siam, in 1826, the independence of Perak and Selangor was recognised, though the Sultan of Perak was permitted to send tribute to Siam if he desired. In the same year the Sultan ceded to the British the Dindings and the island of Pangkor as posts for the suppression of piracy, and agreed to rely solely on the protection of Great Britain. From 1872 to 1874 there was almost continuous fighting of more or less severity between rival factions of Chinese in the Larut district where valuable tin deposits had been found.

Having regard to the anarchy which prevailed, Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874, induced the Perak chiefs to sign the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874), and to accept thereby a Resident whose advice should be "asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and customs." The murder of the first British Resident (Mr. J. W. Birch) in 1875 led to a military expedition and the banishment of the Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair. The country soon settled; and the Malay constitution was restored under a Sultan protected by the British Government. In 1935 the Dindings were retroceded to Perak.

Selangor.

In the 14th century, Klang, which is now a district of Selangor, is said to have been subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the next century it was given to a Penghulu of the family of the Bendaharas of old Malacca, and a son of Sultan Mansur Shah (1458–1477 A.D.) of Malacca was made ruler of Jeram, near Langat. During the period of Portuguese ascendancy, little is known of the Selangor...
who, when they removed to Lingga, left a Dato' Bendahara in charge of Pahang.

In 1887 Sir Frederick Weld negotiated a treaty with the Bendahara of Pahang, promising British help in the event of external attack, and arranging for a British agent to be stationed at his capital.

Since the reconstitution of the council in 1927, the number of members has been increased by the

coast. The Dutch opened factories for the purchase of tin at Kuala Selangor and at Kuala Linggi. In 1718 Daeng Chalak, a Bugis chief, who had married a Johore princess, settled at Kuala Selangor, and about 1780 their descendant was recognised as Sultan Salehuddin by the Sultan of Perak. The throne has remained in the same family ever since. In 1783, the Dutch blockaded Kuala Selangor and forced the Sultan to acknowledge the suzerainty of Holland.

In 1818 the Sultan of Selangor made a commercial treaty with the East India Company at Penang. In 1874 anarchy prevailed amongst the Malay chiefs of Selangor, and pirates ravaged the coastal trade. The Sultan's difficulties were such that he was glad to accept a British Resident and to come under the protection of Great Britain.

Negri Sembilan.

This confederation of "Nine States" consists of the four major States of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the five minor States of Ulu Muar, Jempul, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, and Inas. Sungai Ujong is mentioned in a Javanese poem in 1365 as being subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the 17th century it was ruled by Chiefs of the old kingdom of Malacca. Nearly all the Malay inhabitants of the "Nine States" are descended from immigrants from Minangkabau in Sumatra. Portuguese accounts prove that this immigration had begun in the 16th century. The original Malay federation consisted of Sungai Ujong, Klang (now a district of Selangor), Jelebu, Rembau, Naning (now part of Malacca), Segamat (now in Johore), Pasir Besar (also in Johore, its place having been taken by Johol), Jelai (now Inas), and Ulu Pahang, the region between the Ulu Seriting and Temerloh. After the wresting of Malacca from the Portuguese by the Dutch and the Johore Malays in 1641, Johore took a leading part in Negri Sembilan politics until 1773, when the chiefs of the four major States brought from Sumatra a Yam Tuan named Raja Melawar, ancestor of the present Yang di-pertuan Besar.

In 1874, the Dato' Klana, Chief of Sungai Ujong, the most important of the "Nine States," invited and obtained the assistance of the British Government to maintain his rule and the appointment of a British Resident. In 1883, Jelebu applied for a British Officer; and Rembau agreed to refer all its disputes to the British Government, and in 1887 accepted a British adviser. In 1889, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and the Rulers of Tampin and Rembau asked for a Resident, and agreed to a confederation known as "the Old Negri Sembilan." In 1895, the Resident of this confederation took charge of Sungai Ujong and of Jelebu, and the modern Negri Sembilan was constituted. Finally, in 1898, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti was elected titular Ruler of the whole State.

Pahang.

Chao Ju Kua, a Chinese, writing about 1225, mentions Pahang as being subject to the old Sumatran Buddhist Kingdom of Sri Vijaya. Later, Pahang and Tioman are claimed as conquests of Majapahit. In the 15th century, Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca captured the Ruler of Pahang, and married his daughter. Before the Malacca royal house died out, in 1699, its Pahang branch provided several Rulers for the senior throne of Johore, which directly represented the Malacca dynasty. Later, Pahang fell under the suzerainty of the new Sultans of Johore, who, when they removed to Lingga, left a Dato' Bendahara in charge of Pahang.

In 1887 Sir Frederick Weld negotiated a treaty with the Bendahara of Pahang, promising British help in the event of external attack, and arranging for a British agent to be stationed at his capital. At the same time, the title of Sultan was substituted for that of Dato' Bendahara. In 1888, the Sultan applied for and obtained British protection, and the appointment of a Resident.

Constitution of the States.

The supreme authority in each State is vested in the Sultan, or the Ruler, in State Council. His Highness the Sultan or Ruler presides over the State Council. In 1932, the State Councils were reconstituted on the wider basis. In each of the four States they now include besides the British Resident, Malay chiefs and officials of the State, a number of unofficial members representative of Malay, European, Chinese, and Indian interests.

In Perak and Negri Sembilan there are second chambers which are concerned principally with matters of Malay customs and religion.

The Federation.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries into a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government, while all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand. The States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States* as the agent and representative of the British Government under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. They agreed to follow the Resident-General's advice in all matters of administration other than those touching Islam. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. At this meeting many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

In 1909, a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." Under an Agreement concluded in 1927 the Federal Council was reconstituted with the High Commissioner as President, twelve official, and eleven unofficial members to be nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. At least four of the unofficial members are, if possible, to be Malays.

Since the reconstitution of the council in 1927, the number of members has been increased by the

addition of three officials and one unofficial. The Federal Council generally meets three times a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, but such legislation is enacted by the Rulers of the Federated Malay States by and with the advice and consent of the Federal Council. It still retains the supreme financial control within the Federation, but each State Council now appropriates in a State Supply Enactment the expenditure in respect of purely State services up to a definite sum allocated to the State beforehand by resolution of the Federal Council. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

Climate.

The temperature of the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula has but a small annual range. On the East Coast, however, the North-East Monsoon, lasting from November until March, causes a distinct contrast with the rest of the year with regard to temperature, wind and rainfall. At Jelebu, in Negri Sembilan, the driest station where records have been kept, the average rainfall for 1891-1933 was 65 inches, but in the mountains the average yearly rainfall is very high, being nearly 250 inches near Taiping. The heat is at times oppressive, but the nights generally are cool. On some of the higher mountains (5,000 feet) the night temperature has been known to fall to 42°F. In the daytime there is almost always a breeze to modify the heat. The Peninsula lies within the region of the South-West and North-East Monsoons, but the only really strong regular wind is the North-East Monsoon, which strikes the East Coast from the China Sea. Violent squalls, known as "Sumatras," are not infrequent on the West Coast of the Peninsula between April and October. Generally they are of short duration and occur during the night.

Population.

The result of the census, taken in 1931, shows that the population of the Federated Malay States has increased during the decade from 1,324,890 to 1,713,096 or by 29.3%.

The population as estimated at mid-year 1935, from the formula, census 1931 + births - deaths + migrational surplus, was as follows:

| Population Group | Census 1931 | Estimated Mid-year 1935 |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Malays of British Malaya | 443,618 | 643,003 |
| Other Peoples of Malay Archipelago | 150,113 | |
| Chinese | 711,640 | 717,614 |
| Indians | 379,996 | 387,917 |
| Europeans | 6,350 | 7,145 |
| Eurasians | 4,251 | 4,681 |
| Others | 17,238 | 17,161 |
| **Total** | **1,713,096** | **1,777,421** |

Railways.

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also in the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis, and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (121 miles), extending from Johore Bahru at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, and Province Wellesley to Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—488 miles from Singapore. From Bukit Mertajam near Prai, the line proceeds northwards through Province Wellesley and the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar, 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Royal State Railways of Siam was opened on July 1st, 1918, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,195 miles. Through services are in operation between Penang and Bangkok, the journey occupying 26 hours.

The East Coast Line proceeds northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan, Pahang and Kelantan to Tumpat on the North-East Coast of the Unfederated State of Kelantan, 328 miles from Gemas. At 141 miles the line passes through Kuala Lipis, the Capital of Pahang and at 187½ miles crosses the Pahang-Kelantan Border. Guillemand Bridge across the Kelantan River at 292 miles is the largest bridge in Malaya. It is 2,166 feet long and consists of 5 spans of 250 feet and 5 spans of 150 feet. The East Coast Line provides an alternative route to Siam.

An extension from Pasir Mas in Kelantan runs in a westerly direction for 11¾ miles to the Golok River at the Siamese Boundary, where it joins with the Siamese line running to Haad Yai Junction, where connection is made with the main Bangkok-Penang line.

Through working between the Federated Malay States and Kelantan via the Royal State Railways of Siam commenced in 1921, and via the East Coast Railway in 1931.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson Wharf and Port Weld.

A causeway designed to carry two railway tracks and a roadway has been built across the Johore Strait, connecting the Island of Singapore with the Peninsula.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States Railway Administration is 1,068 miles.

The line is of metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant or buffet cars, and on the East Coast Line sleeping saloons run from Tumpat to Singapore and vice versa on the Through Weekly Express, an observation coach being attached to the rear of the trains between Tumpat and Gemas.

The expenditure on the capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was $233,255,406 up to 31st December, 1934, which, with the exception of $49,735,103 contributed from Loan Funds, has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

In addition $2,032,801 has been expended on Capital Improvements from the Railway Renewals Fund.

Roads.

The mileage of metallised roads maintained by the Public Works Department is 2,845, of which approximately 1,908 miles or 67 per cent. have been bituminously treated, and is made up as follows:

- Perak: 986 miles
- Selangor: 915 miles
- Negri Sembilan: 514 miles
- Pahang, including Cameron Highlands: 450 miles

Total: 2,845 miles
These roads connect up every township of importance throughout the whole of the Federated Malay States.

The total expenditure on the maintenance of metalled roads in 1934 amounted to $1,609,661 and the average cost of up-keep per mile was $586 compared with $565 in 1933.

In addition to metalled roads 181 miles of unmetalled roads and 1,507 miles of bridle paths were maintained.

Posts, Savings Bank, Telegraphs and Telephones.

A well organised system of Posts extends throughout the Federated Malay States by rail, motor car, cycle, runner, sea, and river. All towns and villages of any size have their regular deliveries and collections of mail matter and these facilities are being extended as circumstances require. The external mail services are frequent to all other ports of the world through Port Swettenham and through the Straits Settlements ports of Singapore and Penang. The postal services include Parcel Post, Cash on Delivery (or Value Payable Post), Insurance, Money Orders, British Postal Orders; all these services extend to a great many different countries. They are operated at 99 Post Offices by officers of the Posts and Telegraphs Department and at 72 other places by station-masters and others. Savings Bank business is transacted at all Post Offices at all hours at which they are open, the Bank being controlled by the Department. The interest payable on deposits is 3 per cent. per annum.

The Public Telegraph and Telephone System of the Federated Malay States is provided and maintained by the P. & T. Department and consisted at 31st December, 1934, of 2,921 miles of overhead lines carrying 27,064 miles of wire. In addition, there were 180 miles of underground cables with 15,573 miles of single wire. This included 121 miles of overhead line through Johore, connecting the F.M.S. and Singapore.

The Postal Telegraph System extends throughout the Federated Malay States and is interconnected with the Railway Telegraph System; Railway Telegraph Offices being available for public telegrams where no Postal Telegraph Office exists. At the smaller offices telegrams are transmitted by telephone. Telegraph Lines connect the more important offices to one another, to Singapore, Penang and Malacca in the Straits Settlements, and to various offices in Johore, Kedah, Kelantan and Trengganu; the whole forming the Malayan Telegraph System. There are flat rates for telegrams throughout this system. International telegraphic communication is through Singapore and Penang.

The Telephone system extends throughout the Federated Malay States. There are at present 73 public exchanges, maintaining a continuous night and day service and 31 other places at which Call Offices are maintained, giving a service restricted to the hours during which the local Post Office is open for the transaction of public business. Of the Post Offices in the Federated Malay States, 104, therefore, are provided with public telephone facilities. Public Call Office facilities are also available at a number of Railway Stations. At most of the remaining places, calls including trunk calls, can in case of emergency be made from the local Police Stations.

All the exchanges are connected by means of trunk lines and trunk communication (which may also be obtained from Call Offices) is possible between all exchanges. In case of emergency, trunk calls may be made from the local Police Stations when the Call Offices are closed.

The Federated Malay States telephone system is connected with the telephone system in Singapore, Malacca, Johore, Penang, Province Wellesley, and Kedah.

Trade and Customs.

The trade of the Federated Malay States is principally an export trade in raw materials and produce—agricultural, forest, marine and mineral—in exchange for imports of food, tobacco, fuel oils, clothing and machinery. The export trade was principally with the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom, while the import trade was principally with the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the United Kingdom, British India and Burma, Netherlands India, and Siam.

In 1934 the aggregate value of trade was $287 million, an increase of 60 per cent. when compared with the previous year.

The four Federated Malay States form a single customs unit. The tariff list covers a wide range of dutiable articles and makes provision for a preferential rate of duty on certain goods produced or manufactured in the British Empire. The principal articles subject to duty are as follows:

Imports: Tobacco, liquors, petroleum, sugar, matches, edible oils and fats, cement, cosmetics and perfumery, textiles and wearing apparel, leather, cycles, tyres, milk, jam and preserved fruits, coffee, tea, linoleum, brassware, printing paper and electric batteries. Exports: Tin and tin-ore, tungsten and other metalliferous ores.

Rubber is subject to a cess of 0·7 cent per lb. upon export. The rate prevailing during period June 1st, 1934, to June 30th, 1935, was one cent per pound.

Details of the tariff can be obtained in London at the Malayan Information Agency, Malaya House, Charing Cross, S.W.1.

Perak.

His Highness Paduka Sri Sultan Iskandar Shah, G.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., ibni al-Marhum al-Sultan Idris.

Perak is the most northerly of the Federated States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south and having an area of 7,980 square miles. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress.

The State is well watered, the Perak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus, the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai), being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau, and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills and on Gunong Kledang, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 74,102 acres of land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation for rice. A similar scheme is in course of development in the Sungel Manik area in Lower Perak District.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang, and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is (a) 966 of metallised and (b) 69 of unmetalled cart roads, 950 miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Headquarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Perak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Perak, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory which was taken over in 1909 and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles of area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legah on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasek on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Selangor.

His Highness Ala’idin Suleiman Shah, G.C.M.G., ibni Al-Merhum Raja Muda Musa, Sultan.

Selangor, situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca, and has an area of 3,160 square miles.

Its coast line extends for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The state is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor; the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The natives are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts, viz., Kuala Lumpur and Ulu Langat, Klang, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor, each under a District Officer.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 120,500 (1934 mid-year). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 140 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence.

There were 417 Schools in the State in 1934, including 52 English Schools, 85 Malay Schools, 151 Tamil Schools and 129 Chinese Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River, and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, which called at the port in 1934 was 5,197,669.

The total revenue of the State in 1934 was $23,168,331, and the expenditure $17,349,116. There is no public debt except such as is included in the public debt of the Federation.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and Land Import duties are charged on spirituous liquors, wines, beers, petroleum, tobacco, matches and alum. In 1934 the gross total value of imports was $43,876,300 and the exports $76,298,600.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining, the amount of tin exported in 1934 was 244,374 pikuls valued at $20,619,113. The area alienated for mining is 50,221 acres. The area under coffee has increased from 6,020 acres in 1933 to 6,626 acres. Although coffee prices have been low, far more interest was taken in this crop during the year. In 1934 there were 111,366 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. The rubber industry which had made great progress has met with a set back owing to the recent severe fall in the price of rubber. At the end of 1934 the area under rubber cultivation was 520,350 acres. The value of cultivated rubber exported during 1934 was $48,673,671.

The length of roads upkept in 1934 was 916 miles as against 917 miles in 1933. The total number of miles remetalled during the year 1934 was 46.65 miles of road were treated with bituminous materials. The average cost of maintenance of metallised and gravelled roads was $635 per mile.
Negri Sembilan (The Nine States).

His Highness Tuanku Abdulrahman, K.C.M.G., ibni al-Marhum Tuanku Muhammad, Yang Di-pertuan Besar.

The confederation of States known as Negri Sembilan lies on the Western side of the Peninsula and is bounded on the North-west by Selangor, on the North-east by Pahang, on the East by Johore, on the South by Malacca, and on the South-west by the sea.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungai Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District Officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Ulu Muar in Kuala Pilah, at Tampin, and at Seremban.

The value of imports amounted to $7,366,419 in 1934 and that of exports to $24,433,405. The revenue of the State, which in 1934 amounted to $8,628,850, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1934, 8,800 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 534,584 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Knaia Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the Settlement of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coconuts. During 1934 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:

- Rubber: 364,383 acres
- Rice: 35,030 "
- Coconuts: 5,966 "

Other cultivation covered:
- Oil palm: 1,306 "
- Fruit trees: 5,091 "

Educational facilities comprise 89 Malay Vernacular Schools, 7 English Schools, and 60 Tamil Schools.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 514 miles of metalled roads, of which 372 miles were bituminously treated.

Estimated population, mid. 1935, Negri Sembilan, 240,156.

Pahang.

His Highness al-Sultan Abu Bakar Ri'ayatu'd-Din Mu'adzam Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni al-Marhum al-Mut'aman B'ttah al-Sultan Abdullah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor, and Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, with an area of 13,820 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bern, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming part of the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for houseboats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Bentong, Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Keohau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast Line of the Federated Malay States Railways runs through Pahang and is now open for traffic as far as Tumpat, Kelantan.

There is a motor car service both ways from Knaia Lumpur to Kuala Lipis, 119 miles; also from Jerantut Station on the Railway to Kuantan, a distance of 109 miles.

The total mileage of metalled roads in Pahang is 450 miles. A road from Batu Talam to Kuala Medang has been completed up to the 22nd mile post and it is hoped to link this road with Kuala Lipis, when funds are made available.

The total revenue of the State during 1934 amounted to $4,908,128 and the expenditure to $4,693,127.

There are 5 Government English Schools, 3 private English Schools, 81 Malay Boys' Schools, 5 Malay Girls' Schools, 11 Tamil Schools, and 27 Chinese Schools.
