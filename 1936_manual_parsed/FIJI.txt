FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,700 miles, and from Auckland 1,100 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.
The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, and reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,063 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,130 square miles, Taveuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,083 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a maximum height of 4,300 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and were probably mostly under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Gold is being mined at Yanawai, near the south coast of VanuaLevu Island, and at Tavua in the northern portion of Vitilevu Island, and active prospecting operations are in progress in both localities. At Yanawai the gold is associated with barytes, while at Tavua it occurs in altered andesites. 929 ounces of fine gold were extracted in Australia from gold bullion exported from the Colony during 1934. A very small percentage of silver is found to be associated with the gold in all bullion exported. Copper ore carrying low gold values occurs in the Sambeto valley in the western portion of Vitilevu, but such deposits have not so far been proved to be payable.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In VanuaLevu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Drekoti river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Culocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofuia and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1921 to number 2,402, of whom two-thirds are Methodists, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra.

The natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity. A European Resident Commissioner is the chief executive authority. He also presides over the Rotuma Court of Justice, styled "The Commissioner's Court." The Commissioner's judicial powers are similar to those of a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Fiji and a District Commissioner of the Colony, but special provision is made for the hearing of indictable cases in Rotuma. There are also two Native Stipendiary Magistrates.

The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which is a chief appointed by the Governor, and is administered by the Resident Commissioner with the assistance of a Council of Chiefs, held monthly. The Council, an advisory body, consists of the Resident Commissioner (Chairman), the seven District Chiefs, two Native Stipendiary Magistrates, the Native Medical Practitioner, and one representative from each district.

A Rotuma Regulation Board consisting of the Resident Commissioner, and between five and ten native Rotumans, makes regulations relating to the good government and well-being of the natives. All such regulations are subject to approval by the Legislative Council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the Colony, as estimated on the 31st December, 1934, was:

| Europeans | ... | ... | ... | 4,763 |
| Half-Castes | ... | ... | ... | 3,717 |
| Fijians | ... | ... | ... | 98,479 |
| Rotumans | ... | ... | ... | 1,866 |
| Indians | ... | ... | ... | 83,289 |
| Polynesians | ... | ... | ... | 2,498 |
| Chinese | ... | ... | ... | 1,486 |
| Others | ... | ... | ... | 1,351 |

Total | ... | ... | ... | 197,449

The births among the native population in 1934 totalled 3,696, and the deaths 1,948. The birth rate was 36·44, and the death rate 15·47 per mil.

The Methodist and Roman Catholic missions gave the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1934:

| Methodist | ... | ... | ... | 90,123 |
| Roman Catholic | ... | ... | ... | 16,026 |

Total | ... | ... | ... | 106,149
History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, in 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in 1874 to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the Chief of Bau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taveuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate Colony, and providing for their government.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva is estimated at 1,900.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Malarial fevers have never been met with.

The highest temperature at Suva in 1934 was 95 degrees on Jan. 20th, and the lowest 63 degrees on July 19th and 26th, and September 2nd. The total rainfall was 134.33 inches. The average annual rainfall is 118.61 inches. There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 9th February, 1929. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Secretary for Indian Affairs, and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and not more than thirteen nominated members, six European elected members, three native members, and three Indian elected members. The natives retain a large share of self-government. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by a triennial meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," which has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council.

Shipping.

Suva and Levuka are ports of Registry under the Merchant Shipping Act. On the 31st December, 1934, there were on the Register 4 steam vessels of a tonnage of 5,387 tons, and 11 motor vessels of a tonnage of 960 tons.

The number of local vessels trading within the Colony and holding Sea-going Certificates from the Marine Board during 1934 was:

| Owned by | No. | Tons |
|----------|-----|------|
| Europeans | 38  | 1,480|
| Natives   | 17  | 225  |
| Others    | 15  | 232  |
|           |     | 70   |
|           |     | 1,937|

The number of merchant vessels entered from overseas at the three ports of entry in the Colony during the year 1934 was 167, the total registered tonnage being 810,233; of these vessels 106 were British, tonnage 475,687; 34 American, 312,444 tons; 2 Danish, 3,605 tons; 4 Swedish, 13,762 tons; 2 Panamanian, 4,292 tons; 8 Tongan, 436 tons; 1 Italian, 7 tons.

Local Government.

On the 1st July, 1935, the municipality of Levuka, the old capital of Fiji, was abolished and a Town Board, the members of which are nominated by the Governor, assumed control.

It is anticipated that a similar change will be affected with regard to the municipality of Suva in 1936.

Education.

The Education Ordinance No. 1 of 1929 constituted the Department of Education and established the Board of Education. The Board consists of the Director of Education and eight other members nominated by the Governor. The Ordinance gives very wide powers to the Board to control all phases of education. The most important are the registering of schools and teachers, the allocating of grants-in-aid, the determining of the instruction to be given and to advise the Governor on establishing of education districts. Only two such districts, Suva and Levuka, have been established.
The Education Rating Ordinance No. 18 of 1934 authorises the levying of a special rate in these two districts to meet one-half the net cost incurred by the Government in maintaining Government schools within the limits of the districts.

There are two Grammar Schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, with hostels attached, and a public school in Levuka, all under Government control. The roll number during 1934 at the Boys Grammar School, Suva, was 152; at the Girls Grammar School, Suva (where boys under 8 are taken), 219. The roll in 1934 for the Levuka Public School was 122 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School at Nasinu, near Suva, is intended to provide for the higher education of natives, and is maintained from public revenue. The number of boys on the roll during 1934 was 88.

Schools for the primary education of Fijians may be conducted by the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist Missions, by the Provincial Councils, by any other properly constituted authority or by the Government. Six Provincial schools have been established by the Government at Lau, Taveuni, Lodoni, Kadavu, Nadi, and Sawani, in charge of European Headmasters.

At the end of 1934 there were 203 Government and assisted schools, 122 for Fijians, Rotumans, etc., 57 for Indians, 9 receiving both Fijians and Indians, 13 for Europeans and half-castes, one for Chinese and one for Melanesians.

They had 16,080 pupils, of whom there were 9,939 Fijians, Rotumans and Melanesians, 4,834 Indians, 1,218 Europeans and half-castes, and 89 Chinese.

In addition returns were received from 78 recognised schools with 3,757 pupils—3,417 Fijians, Rotumans, etc., 231 Indians, 109 Europeans and half-castes.

There were 463 registered and 711 recognised teachers in the Colony at the end of 1934.

The estimated Expenditure on Education for 1935 is £45,043.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is Fiji notes and coin. Under Ordinance I., of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908. At the end of 1934, there were 7,610 depositors and 167,823l. in deposits. Arrangements were made in 1914 for the issue of Government Currency Notes. At the end of 1934, the circulation of Government Currency Notes was 506,878l. 15s. Od. Fiji coinage was introduced in 1934.

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka, and Lautoka, and the Bank of New Zealand at Suva.

Industries, Trade, and Customs.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 34 tons were exported. The cotton industry is again receiving attention.

As a result of the Ottawa Conference, Australia now admits 40,000 centsals of bananas per year, with a preferential duty of 2/6 per cental. High costs in Australia still provide a barrier to trade and the shipments are much below the authorised quantity. Previously, owing to the imposition by the Commonwealth Government, in 1921, of a prohibitive duty on imported bananas, the export of this fruit was entirely confined to the New Zealand Market. A number of trial shipments of bananas to Canada have been made and there appear to be possibilities of developing that market.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of Bananas, Pineapples, and citrus fruits. Exports, the produce of the Colony, decreased in value from 1,532,181l. in 1933 to 1,341,678l. in 1934. In 1934, exports of Sugar, Copra, and fruit were:—Sugar, 103,863 tons, value 1,069,049l.; Copra, 23,520 tons, value 127,941l.; Bananas, 324,494 bunches, value 67,845l.; Fresh Pines, 2,171 cases, value 816l.

The other principal exports in 1934 consisted of:—Beche-de-mer, 272 cwt., value 1,408l.; Biscuits plain, 53,749 lbs., value 1,088l.; Butter, 1,307 cwt., value 4,016l.; Coconuts, 300,040 nuts, value 807l.; Canned Pines, 282,686 lbs., value 3,808l.; Gum, 3,936 cwt., value 4,364l.; Hides, 4,546 hides, value 1,917l.; Molasses, 16,828 tons, value 16,828l.; Shell Trocas, 319 tons, value 20,733l.; Soap plain, 2,633 cwt., value 3,244l.; Vegetables, fresh, 1,962 cwt., value 940l.; and Gold Bullion, 1,033 ozs., value 7,590l.

The rice crop continued almost to meet local demands, it being found necessary to import only 294 tons during 1934. The whole of the crop is now milled in small privately-owned mills.

Dairying is an established industry.

Many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted for cattle and sheep raising.

A soap factory has been established in Suva which supplies a considerable proportion of the local requirements for laundry soaps and exported 2,633 cwt. during 1934.

The Customs Tariff is, in general, on an ad valorem basis, duty being assessed on the value of goods at the Port of Shipment. Practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British Empire material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the value of the goods, and that the final processes of manufacture are performed within the Empire.

The total trade of the Colony in 1934 was 2,451,659l.

The total trade was divided as follows:

| Imports % | Exports % |
|-----------|-----------|
| United Kingdom | 36·45 | 46·33 |
| Other British Possessions | 43·00 | 46·58 |
| Foreign Countries | 18·16 | 6·90 |
| Parcels Post | 2·39 | — |
| Ships Stores | — | 1·19 |

The following figures show the trade of the Colony during the last five years:

| Year | Imports | Exports | Total Trade |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1930 | 1,219,184l. | 1,484,526l. | 2,703,710l. |
| 1931 | 929,514l. | 1,000,187l. | 1,929,701l. |
| 1932 | 837,346l. | 1,698,964l. | 2,536,310l. |
| 1933 | 1,069,266l. | 1,725,529l. | 2,794,795l. |
| 1934 | 995,204l. | 1,456,455l. | 2,451,659l. |
The value of imports from the principal countries during the last five years was as follows:

| Country          | 1930   | 1931   | 1932   | 1933   | 1934   |

Means of Communication.

There is a direct six-weekly cargo service with the United Kingdom.

There is regular steam communication with Australia and New Zealand, a monthly service with Canada, and a monthly service with U.S.A. Inter-island communication is maintained by regular steamer or cutter services.

Postage to the United Kingdom, India, the Australian States, New Zealand, and British Colonies is 2½d. for 1 oz., 1½d. for every additional oz. To other countries in the Postal Union 3½d. for 1 oz., every succeeding oz. 1½d.

Internal postal rates: letters, 2½d. for 1 oz., 1½d. for every additional oz.; newspapers, for every 4 ozs., 1½d. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is 3 lbs. 3s. 3½d., 7 lbs. 5s. 10½d., and 11 lbs. 8s. 6d. There is also a parcels post with the Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, India, Ceylon and the United States of America. The rates of postage are as follows:

Australia and Tonga—
1 lb., 8½d.; every additional lb. up to 11 lbs., 6½d.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

The Imperial Postal Order system has been adopted by this Colony.

Letters from England sent via San Francisco or Vancouver reach Fiji in about 28 days.

A wireless telegraphy service is operated in the Colony. There are stations at Suva and Lautoka in the island of Viti Levu, at Labasa and Savusavu in the island of Vanua Levu and at Waiyevo, Taveuni, and Rotuma. Telephone Exchanges have been established at Suva, Levuka, Nausori, Davulilevu, Navua, Taveuni and Savu Savu. Suva is connected by telephone line to Levuka, Navua, Nausori and Vunidawa. Suva is directly connected by submarine cable with New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. An external wireless service linking the Colony directly with Australia is operated by the Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Limited.

There is no railway in the Colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. owns various tram lines connecting its estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands, and more are in process of construction. An all-weather motor road, connecting Suva with Tailevu, Tavua, Ba, Lautoka, Nadi and Sigatoka, has been completed, and the final link between Sigatoka and Suva, a distance of approximately 75 miles, is at present in course of construction.
