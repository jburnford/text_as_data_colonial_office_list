STRAITS SETTLEMENTS

Malaya comprises the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, and the Unfederated States of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Perlis. Malaya is also regarded as including the State of Brunei, in the island of Borneo, of which the Governor of the Straits Settlements is High Commissioner and which, like the Malay States in the Peninsula, is in treaty relationship with Great Britain.

The Straits Settlements comprise Singapore, Penang, Malacca, and Labuan. The first three were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c.115). Labuan, a separate Colony since 1848, was incorporated with the Straits Settlements as part of the Settlement of Singapore in 1907, and became a separate Settlement in 1912.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 26 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 220 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, to which it is joined by a causeway across the Straits of Johore, which are about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which are included in the Settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the city of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang comprises the island of Penang and Province Wellesley. Penang island is about 15 miles long and 11 broad, containing an area of 110 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait about 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the Settlement, about 11 miles in width, and extending 31 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian river (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 290 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long., on Penang island.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 miles from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 43 miles in length, and 27 miles in breadth, containing an area of 640 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated in the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long 98° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers (1931) 1,142.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated in the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 60 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 11 miles, and its greatest breadth about 11 miles. The inhabitants, who number (1931) 1,059, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employees of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance. An account of Labuan will be found below, page 373.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,357 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907, and in 1912 the island became a separate Settlement.
The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time. A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements. An account of Brunei will be found below, page 396.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17 March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became a place of reduced commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but as soon as Singapore was established Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. Although at first unimportant Penang's trade has now assumed large proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula. The trade of Malacca as an entrepôt port for central Malaya has recently revived.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of $6,000 (Straits) should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000 (Straits). This acquisition has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 290 square miles. This province is in an advanced state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded to the British by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole formed, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang. By an agreement dated, at Singapore, the 6th June, 1934, the Dindings were retroceded to Perak in February, 1935.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end about 1365, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819 by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council consists of 6 official members, excluding the Governor who presides, such other official members as the Governor may nominate, at present 2 in number, and 3 unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of 13 official members and 13 unofficial members, of whom 2 are elected by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local Ordinances and in such English Acts and Orders in Council as are applicable to the Colony. The Penal Code follows closely the Indian Penal Code. Criminal Procedure is regulated by the Criminal Procedure Code which is based on the Indian Code. Civil Procedure is regulated by Rules of Court made under powers conferred by the Courts Ordinance, 1934, and based on the English Rules of the Supreme Court.

There is a Supreme Court which is a Court of record and consists of (a) the High Court which exercises original criminal and civil jurisdiction and appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction in appeals from subordinate courts; (b) the Court of Appeal which exercises appellate civil jurisdiction. Assizes are held at Singapore and Penang every two months, and once a quarter at Malacca. The Supreme Court is composed of a Chief Justice and three or more Puisne Judges. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council.

There is also a Court of Criminal Appeal. The subordinate Courts are the District Courts, Police Courts, Marine Magistrates' Courts and Coroners' Courts.

Climate.

The characteristic features of the climate of the Straits Settlements are uniform temperature, high humidity and copious rainfall. The variation of temperature throughout the year is very small and the excessively high temperatures found in continental tropical areas are never experienced.

The mean temperature during 1934 was:

- Singapore (Mount Faber) ... 80-1°F.
- Penang (District Hospital) ... 81-5°F.
- Province Wellesley (Bagan Dalam) ... 80-1°F.
- Malacca (Bukit China) ... 79-0°F.
The Mean Monthly Maximum and Minimum Temperature varied as follows:

| Location | Mean Monthly Maximum | Highest °F | Lowest °F |
|----------|----------------------|------------|-----------|
| Singapore | 87-9 May              | 82-6 Jan   |           |
| Penang   | 90-4 April            | 88-3 Oct   |           |

| Location | Mean Monthly Minimum | Lowest °F | Highest °F |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|------------|
| Singapore | 70-8 Feb.             | 76-4 Aug. |           |
| Penang   | 73-0 Jan.             | 74-0 June |           |

The extremes of temperature (Highest Maximum and Lowest Minimum) recorded were:

| Location | Highest °F | Lowest °F |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Singapore | 90 on several days | 67 on 30th and 31st Jan. |
| Penang   | 93 on several days | 68 on 31st Jan. |

There are no well marked dry and wet seasons, rain falling throughout the year.

Records for 64 years at Singapore show that the average annual rainfall is 95 inches. December is the wettest month with a little over 10 inches, while February, May, June, July and September the dry months with between 6½ and 7 inches. Rain falls, on the average, on half the days in the year.

The wettest year recorded was 1913 with 135-92 inches and the driest 1888 with 63-21 inches.

Records of 50 years at Penang show an annual rainfall of 107½ inches, October being the wettest month with nearly 17 inches and February the driest with three inches. Rain falling on the average on about 165 days in the year.

The force of the monsoons is not much felt though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz.:

S.W. from May to October,
N.E. from November to April,

but at the coastal stations, the diurnal land and sea breezes are often stronger than the prevailing monsoons.

The Rainfall recorded was as follows:

| Year | No. of Rainfall days in |
|------|-------------------------|
|      | 1932 | 1933 | 1934 | 1934 |
| Singapore | 77-49 | 82-52 | 106-55 | 194 |
| Penang   | 109-11 | 97-37 | 137-31 | 205 |
| Malacca  | 71-60 | 95-91 | 91-43 | 187 |
| Province Wellesley | 108-77 | 88-33 | 111-13 | 191 |
| Dindings | 68-52 | 59-02 | 77-86 | 184 |
| Labuan   | 155-58 | 121-93 | 124-51 | 180 |

Although the days are hot, and, on account of the high humidity somewhat oppressive, the nights are almost always reasonably cool, and it rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not obtained. The effect of the heat and humidity, without seasonal change, is, however, cumulative; and after a few years a change to a bracing climate becomes imperative for Europeans if health is to be maintained.

Population.

The population of the Straits Settlements as estimated at mid-year 1935, from the formula, census 1931 + births - deaths + migrational surplus, was as follows:

| Island/Province | Population |
|-----------------|------------|
| Singapore Island | 572,310    |
| Penang Island   | 197,685    |
| Province Wellesley | 144,219    |
| Malacca         | 198,257    |
| Labuan          | 7,552      |
| Christmas Island | 1,021      |
| Cocos Island    | 1,142      |
| Total           | 1,119,186  |

Commerce.

The foreign trade of the Colony of the Straits Settlements is not separately distinguished, having since 1922 been merged in that of the Malayan Registration area which includes the Colony, the Federated Malay States, and the Unfederated Malay States of Johore, Kodah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu. This trade passes principally through the ports of Singapore and Penang in the Colony, and Port Swettenham in the F.M.S.

The principal agricultural products are rubber, coconuts, pineapples, palm oil, and rice. Tobacco is a crop of growing importance.

The principal imports comprise foodstuffs, petroleum products, tin ore, rubber, textiles and machinery. The chief domestic exports are rubber, smelted tin, copra, palm oil, tinned pineapples and areca-nuts with a few manufactured articles. There is an important transit trade in the ports of Singapore and Penang. The chief re-exports are mineral oils, rice, spices, textiles, and dried and salted fish.

The ports of the Straits Settlements are free ports and are subject to no import or export duties. There are excise duties on liquors, tobacco, and petroleum, and a tax on first registration of motor vehicles not manufactured in the British Empire.

The following shew the total imports and exports for the six years up to 1934 and the values of some of the principal articles in 1934.

**Shipping**

Singapore and George Town (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had on the 31st December, 1934, 815 steam, motor, and sailing vessels registered, of a total gross tonnage of 133,777 tons.

The ports of Singapore and Penang are administered under Ordinance No. 125 (Merchant Shipping) by the Marine Department, and by Harbour Boards under Ordinance No. 130 (Ports) in each Settlement (Singapore and Penang) for the management of the wharves. Malacca is also a port at which ocean-steamer call. The number of merchant steamers of over 75 tons net register with cargo and in ballast, and the aggregate tonnage arriving at the ports in 1934 were:

| Port       | Nos. | Tons.      |
|------------|------|------------|
| Singapore  | 6,829| 14,922,617 |
| Penang     | 2,372| 6,180,899  |
| Malacca    | 548  | 704,977    |

The following table shows the comparison between British tonnage and the total tonnage of merchant steamers of over 75 tons net register with cargo and in ballast, arrived and departed at the ports of the Straits Settlements, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Labuan, and Christmas Island, for each of the years from 1930 to 1934:

| Year | Tonnage | Tonnage |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1930 | 21,234,368 | 46,282,734 |
| 1931 | 19,387,071 | 43,640,442 |
| 1932 | 18,910,617 | 43,353,043 |
| 1933 | 18,275,789 | 43,011,782 |
| 1934 | 19,456,917 | 43,961,730 |

**Note:**—The definition of merchant steamers was altered, with effect from January, 1931, from vessels of 50 tons net register and over, to vessels of over 75 tons net register. The figures for the year 1930 have thus been altered on this basis, i.e., decreased by -770, so as to afford a more accurate comparison with those of 1931.

**Communications.**

(i) **Steamship Lines.**

Over 50 lines of sea-going steamers touch at Singapore. The following table shows the main lines of communication:

| Line | Service |

Air Mail Services.

The Imperial Airways and the Royal Netherlands Airways each provide a fast, regular and reliable twice-weekly air mail service, the former from Singapore to London and vice versa and the latter from Singapore-Amsterdam to London and vice versa. The aircraft of both companies call at Alor Star (Kedah) en route. The time taken in transit between Singapore and London varies from 8 to 9 days.

In addition to the above services, an air mail service is in operation between Singapore and Australia, leaving the former air port every Monday. The air mails are due to arrive at Darwin every Tuesday evening and at the various capitals of the Australian States within a further two or three days according to destination.

(iii) Telegraphs and Telephones.

Telegraph Offices are maintained by the Eastern Extension Australasia & China Telegraph Co. Ltd., at Singapore and Penang, and this company also owns and operates eleven submarine cables radiating from Singapore:—

5 to Penang, thence to Madras (2), Colombo (2), Deli Sumatra (1), 2 to Batavia of which one thence to Cocos, 1 to Banjoewangi (Java), thence to Port Darwin (1), 1 to Hong Kong, thence to Manila (1), North China (1), Macao (1), 1 to Cochinchina, thence to Hong Kong (1) and 1 to Labuan, thence to Hong Kong (1).

The Public Telegraph and Telephone Systems of the Straits Settlements are, apart from the telephone exchange systems on Singapore Island, provided, maintained and operated by the P. & T. Department. Excluding the Singapore Telephone System, these consisted on 31st December, 1934, of 537 miles of overhead lines, carrying 3,754 miles of wire, and 98 miles of underground and submarine cables with 9,405 miles of single wire. There were at that date 42 telegraph offices and 19 telephone exchanges with 1,603 telephones connected thereto.

The Postal Telegraph System connects the three Settlements of Singapore, Penang and Malacca and is also interconnected with the corresponding systems in the Federated and Unfederated Malay States of the Peninsula, forming with these the Malayan Telegraph System. Flat rates per word are charged throughout this system.

A Telephone Trunk network, provided and maintained by the P. & T. Department, interconnects Singapore, Penang and Malacca and all telephone exchanges in the Federated and Unfederated Malay States except a few of the more remote exchanges.

The Telephone Exchange System of Singapore is owned and operated by the Oriental Telephone and
Electric Company Ltd., under licence from the Straits Settlements Government.

(iv) Railways and Roads.

The Federated Malay States Railways system connects with the Royal State Railways of Siam, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,195 miles, the journey taking 50 hours. Sections connect the main line with ports on the West Coast. A line from Gemas in Negri Sembilan, through Pahang and Kelantan, connects with the Royal State Railways of Siam on the East Coast.

There are 864-57 miles of roads which were maintained in good order at a cost of $477,734-63 or $582-56 per mile. The figures for 1933 were 866 miles maintained at a cost of $439,318 or $507-3 per mile.

In addition to normal maintenance a sum of $213,004 was spent on improvements and reconstruction work. The corresponding figure for last year being $233,093.

The mileage of asphalted roads maintained is 574 miles 37 chains, which is made up as follows:

| Mileage Chains |
|----------------|
| Singapore      | 137 51 |
| Penang         | 73 09 |
| Province Wellesley | 145 04 |
| Dindings       | 32 53 |
| Malacca        | 185 82 |
| Labuan         | 19 78 |

Total 574 37

Education.

The control of all Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements, and Adviser on Education, Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. The Government assists certain Chinese vernacular schools by a system of grants-in-aid. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided in Government or grant-in-aid schools, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are secular. Raffles College was opened in Singapore in 1929 for a higher education in English. There is a Reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1934 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 23 | 9,431 | 9,078 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 34 | 15,640 | 14,898 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 219 | 23,497 | 22,155 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 69 | 8,238 | 7,578 |
| Total | 345 | 58,806 | 53,709 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar, and also the old Hong Kong dollar which was at that time legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed in England in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin was of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council, dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced.

Local silver and nickel coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and copper coins are legal tender up to $1. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of denominations 25 cents and ten cents were issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver, but their issues have been discontinued. These notes were legal tender to the extent of $2.

By the Currency Ordinance passed in 1923 the various funds controlled by the Currency Commissioners were amalgamated into one fund styled the Currency Guarantee Fund.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; the F. & O. Banking Corporation; Eastern Bank Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the National City Bank of New York; the Banque de l'Indo-Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, the Yokohama Specie Bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, the China and Southern Bank, Lee Wah Bank, Thomas Cook & Son (Bankers) Limited and Kwong Lee Banking Company.

The first two banks abovementioned were, at one time, allowed to issue notes in the Colony, the former under its Charter, and the latter by law, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1934 was $135,965 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the end of 1934 was $75,786,490. These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank at each Settlement.

THE SETTLEMENT OF LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is about 35 square miles. It is distant from the coast at the nearest point about six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 130 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British Ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1889 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and, as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1905, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore. On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was constituted a separate Settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded, great hopes of the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success. In 1893, the Central Borneo Company was reconstituted under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited. The mines have been closed since the beginning of 1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 14 feet can go alongside the East Wharf.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton.

Labuan is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, para rubber, jelutong and copra, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and over 10,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office Savings Bank in Labuan. Harrisons and Crosfield (Borneo) Ltd. are the local Sub-Agents of the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The currency is that of the Straits Settlements.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other natives from Brunei and the mainland of Borneo, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

There are four Government schools, viz.—The Government English School, the Vernacular School for boys, the Vernacular School for girls in Victoria, and the Vernacular School in Bukit Kallam. In addition there are five private schools, viz.—St. Anne's School (Roman Catholic Mission), Mrs. Fell's Private School, Chung Hwa School, Chi Win School, and Chung Hwa Girls' School.

A reservoir owned by the Government supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking water.

The Eastern Extension, Australasian and China Telegraph Company has a station on the island connected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong, and North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

The Brunei Government maintains a Wireless Station which communicates with the Stations erected in the neighbouring countries of Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo.

A weekly service of steamers plying between Singapore, North Borneo Ports, and the Philippines provides Labuan with regular communication with these places; there are, in addition, local coasting steamers.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. Ships exercising their crews.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues, land rents and licences.

The public revenue and expenditure for the last three years were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
