NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitang River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of about 29,347 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern frontier was delimited in 1912-1913 by an Anglo-Dutch boundary commission, whose report was confirmed by a treaty at London on the 28th September, 1915.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at present at Sandakan. Other stations are at Semporna, Lamag, Beluran, Langkon, Kotabelud, Tuaran, Penampang, Papar, Beaufort, Mempakul, Sipitang, Tenom, Keningau, Tambunan, Ranau, and Pensiangan.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The country is mountainous. The highest point is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who at the Census taken in 1931 numbered 270,223, are mainly Brunais, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade. Further back, the Dusuns, the most numerous native race in North Borneo, cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields, and in the uplands they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt. The Muruts, another interior tribe, are numerous; formerly they varied more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting, but are now peaceable. The Chinese population is steadily increasing and is now not far short of 48,000; they form the trading, gardening and artisan section of the community. There is a State-aided scheme of Chinese immigration. Europeans number about 400. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of about 17,600. There are several missions, including the Church of England, with stations at Sandakan, Kudat, and Jesselton, and the Roman Catholic with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast and twenty schools in various parts of the country. The Church of England, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and seven schools elsewhere. The Basel Mission has eighteen schools, the principal ones being at Jesselton, Sandakan, Kudat, and Papar. Government maintains eight vernacular schools at various places in the territory.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive concessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a Company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (afterwards Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further concessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of the British Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.
Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 150 inches, according to situation.

Annual Mean Temperature... 81 degrees
Recorded extremes maximum 96 "
minimum 60 "

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are four Residencies, viz., the Sandakan, West Coast, Tawau, and Interior Residencies.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based upon Indian law and the principal Indian Codes have been adopted in the State. Many enactments of the Straits Settlements also have been incorporated in local Ordinances. Courts of law are correlative to the Indian Courts under the Indian Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, while there are Imams' Courts for the administration of Moslem matrimonial law, and Native Courts to deal with matters of native custom.

Industry.

The principal products of the country are estate rubber, timber, copra, and cutch. The rapid expansion of the rubber industry is indicated by the increase in exports of the commodity from 24 tons in 1910 to 11,102 tons in 1934. The vast timber resources of the country form one of its principal assets; until 1920 only the fringe of the forests was worked, but in that year a company was formed for more adequate timber exploitation with modern lumbering apparatus. At Sandakan two large steam-driven sawmills have been working for some years; there are also a modern band sawmill and an electrically driven sawmill. Exports of timber in 1934 were valued at 263,279l.; the principal markets were Hong Kong, China, Japan and Great Britain. The number of coconut plantations has rapidly increased in the last two decades and exports of copra have risen considerably; in 1934 the value of copra shipped was 26,544l. Cutch, a tanning material obtained from the bark of certain mangrove trees, is manufactured at Sandakan; exports in 1934, 22,768l. Tobacco grows well; extensive areas were formerly cultivated by European companies with the special variety used for the wrappers of cigars, but this industry has waned. The natives also engage in the cultivation of tobacco, but the principal crop grown by them is rice, the production of which is however still insufficient to meet local demands. The fishing industry gives employment to a large number of natives; exports of dried and salt fish in 1934 were valued at 25,277l. Sago is manufactured and exported. Other articles of export are damar, livestock, edible birds' nests collected in certain limestone caves, firewood, rattans, charcoal, and seed pearls. Fruit growing is an important industry and increasing attention is being given to the cultivation of manila hemp, coffee, and pepper, all of which thrive.

The Chartered Company does not itself directly engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, excise, quit rents, licences, royalties, poll tax, and other usual sources of revenue.

Sandakan on the East and Jesselton on the West are the principal ports. Both towns have developed rapidly, and are now supplied with electric light and cold storage. Considerable sums have been spent by Government on reclamation, improvement of water supplies, etc., at both ports.

Large resources of coal exist in the country behind Cowie Harbour in the south east and seams occur elsewhere in the territory. Gold in alluvial form is found in certain of the rivers on the East Coast.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. Indications of the presence of petroleum occur in many parts of the State, but so far it has not been found to exist in commercial quantity; prospecting work is still proceeding.

Customs Tariff.

Customs duties are leviable in North Borneo both on an ad valorem and a specific basis. The prevailing ad valorem duty rates are 5 per cent. and 10 per cent.; chiefly the latter.

A preferential import tariff (varying from one-third to three-quarters of the general tariff import rates) came into force on 10th October, 1933, applicable to certain specified goods imported from any part of the British Empire. Following Colonial practice, as in the United Kingdom, a proportion of 25 per cent. of Empire material, labour, etc., is required in most cases, and of 50 per cent. in a selected few.

The rates of duty on the most important articles are as follows:

| Article | Preferential | General Tariff |

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent, and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes. There is also a silver coin of 25 cents. The State Bank of North Borneo has its head office at Sandakan. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Bank of Taiwan.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every week between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Hong Kong, Japan, and the Dutch East Indies, and a local company maintains a service along the coast and to the Philippine Islands. The State Railway on the West Coast, which is a metre gauge line, connects Jesselton with Beaufort, 57 miles distant. At Beaufort the line divides, one section proceeding to the port of Weston (20 miles), the other to Melalap in the interior (40 miles). In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 124 miles. At Jesselton there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. There is a first class metalled road 21 miles long, from Jesselton to Tuaran; another proceeds from Sandakan in a north-westerly direction, 15 miles of metalling have been completed and earthworks to mile 19. Road construction is being pushed forward in other localities of the State. There is a system of bridle-paths covering a total distance of 600 miles. Wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, and Lahad Datu. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about thirty days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 8 cents for the first oz., 4 cents each succeeding oz.; foreign countries, 12 cents for the first oz., 6 cents each succeeding oz.

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, and Lahad Datu. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan, and Kudat.
