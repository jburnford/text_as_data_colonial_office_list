KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coast line from Umba River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 14th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000£ per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1903, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into four Provinces, and three extra-provincial districts.

1. The Nyanza Province, comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu-Londiani.

2. The Rift Valley Province comprising the districts of Nakuru, Ravine, Baringo, Naivasha, Laikipia, Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo, and Trans-Uzoia.

3. The Central Province comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kyambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, North Nyeri, Embu, Meru, Machakos, and Kitui.

4. The Coast Province comprising the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and Lamu.
5. The Northern Frontier District comprising the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, and Talamugger.

6. The Turkana District, comprising the districts of Turkana and West Suk.

7. The Masai District, comprising the districts of Ngong and Kajiado.

The Capital of the Colony is Nairobi. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Europeans | Asiatics | Natives | Total |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1934 |           |          |         |       |
|      | 5,400     | 15,000   | 27,000  | 47,400|

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 50,800, of whom about 800 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours, Mombasa harbour on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A Municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928.

**Population.**

The total population is estimated at 31st December, 1934, as follows:

| Race            | Number |
|-----------------|--------|
| Europeans       | 17,501 |
| Indians         | 34,955 |
| Arabs           | 12,131 |
| Goans           | 3,316  |
| Other non-natives | 1,401 |
| Total non-natives | 69,304 |
| Africans        | 3,024,975 |
| Total           | 3,094,279 |

On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkana, the Massai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

**Constitution.**

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 29th March, 1934, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner, Commissioner for Local Government, Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex-officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex-officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and two nominated unofficial members to represent the interests of the African community. The ex-officio members are the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate forms one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

**East Africa Governors' Conference.**

In pursuance of a recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission which visited E. Africa in 1924, a first Conference of Governors of the British East African Dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1926, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was then decided that a permanent Secretariat for the Conference should be established at Nairobi and conferences held as and when necessary. Subsequently the Joint Select Committee on Closer Union in East Africa recommended that the machinery of the Governors' Conference should be increasingly utilised for the purpose of ensuring continuous and effective cooperation and co-ordination in all matters of common interest to East Africa. As a result of this, it was decided that the Conference should be deemed to be in permanent session with a view to its being convened at any time when necessary, and that there should in any case be an annual meeting of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika Territory and Uganda, attended, if desired, by the Governors of Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and the British Resident, Zanzibar. The cost of the Secretariat is contributed in varying proportions by the East African Governments and by the Kenya and Uganda Railway Administration. The Secretary of the Conference is Colonel C. W. G. Walker, C.M.G., D.S.O., who is also Secretary to the High Commissioner for Transport, Kenya and Uganda. Salary £1,500.
Climate.

For purposes of rainfall Kenya may be divided into three parts:

1. Northern Desert area where there is usually less than 20 inches a year.
2. The coastal strip and the Nyanza and Kirinyga Provinces where there may be from 40 to 80 inches a year, and
3. The remainder of Kenya where rainfall is from 20 to 40 inches a year. On the Coast there is usually a single rainy season from April to November, but up-country there are generally "long" rains from April to June, and "short" rains from October to December. The Coastal regions have a tropical climate though nights are cool except during the hottest months from December to April. In the Highlands the climate is invigorating with cool breezes; at Nairobi the mean maximum shade temperature in 1931 was 73.1°F, and the mean minimum 54.9°F. The rainfall at Nairobi was 45.59 inches.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at 1s. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw from circulation the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a rupee) have been withdrawn from circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26, Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret, and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London), have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kiambu, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Kitale, Kakamega, in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated The National Bank of South Africa Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale and Kakamega, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Land and Products.

As the pursuit of agriculture is possible from sea level to altitudes of over 9,000 feet, climatic conditions are extremely varied and tropical, sub-tropical and temperate crops are grown.

Considerable quantities of hides are exported from all parts of the Colony, but the principal producing areas developed at present are at elevations of 4,000 feet and over.

In the highlands coffee, maize, wattle, tea, wheat and potatoes are the principal crops and in the lower parts of the Colony, including the Coast, sisal, maize, coconuts, cotton, sugar cane and miscellaneous grains and oil seeds are grown.

Exports of agricultural commodities in 1934 were valued at £1,602,212.

Whereas considerable quantities of foodstuffs for the non-native population were imported in former years most of these have now been replaced by home-grown supplies.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock. Butter and cheese are prepared and supplies of the former are being exported.

Fishing industries are established on the Coast and Lake Victoria and provide valuable supplies for local consumption.

The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as Podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

The following minerals have been located:

Gold has been found throughout the Nyanza Province and in the southern part of the Masai Reserve. Traces of gold are widespread in rocks of the basement complex.

Silver is commonly associated with the gold discoveries, and also occurs with base metals in the Coastal Province.

Copper occurs in small quantities only.

Lead and Zinc are found in the Coastal Province.

Asbestos occurs in basement complex rocks at a certain horizon, the best known occurrences being in Machakos and West Suk.

Arsenic occurs in the form of arsenical pyrites in the Nyanza Province.

Barite is found in the Coastal Province.

Diatomite is found near Gilgil and in many other parts where lacustrine beds occur.

Gypsum has been discovered near Simba.

Iron Magnetite-quartzites occur in the basement complex and form a possible ore for the future.

Ilmenite (Titanium). The sand is abundantly concentrated in the rivers of the Nyanza Province.

Limestone. Abundant in Coastal Province. Recrystallized as marble it occurs in enormous quantities near Voi, Kajiado, in Loldaika Hills and in other places.

Manganese occurs in the Coastal Province.

Mica occurs in basement complex rocks. It has been worked in West Suk and in the Ukamba Reserve.

Olivine is concentrated in the rivers draining the Aberdares.

Potash and Soda. These salts are being exploited at Lake Magadi.

Tin. Cassiterite has been discovered in the Trans-Nzoia.

Zircon is an abundant constituent in the river beds of Nyanza but is particularly plentiful in the streams draining the Coastal ranges.

The total area of land alienated as at December, 31st, 1934, was 6,752,640 acres. In addition, there are 387,840 acres of Township and Government Reserves.

Trade, Customs and Excise.

Under the terms of the Congo Basin Treaties equality of treatment in respect of imported goods irrespective of origin is ensured, and the grant of
Imperial Preference is therefore inadmissible. Goods declared as in transit are allowed to be imported and forwarded under Customs control on payment of expenses of administration (8d. per package).

For purposes of Customs, Kenya and Uganda form a single unit and by agreement with the Tanganyika Territory Government a common Tariff has been accepted by the three territories, the free and unrestricted movement within the territories of both imported goods and local products being thus secured. The Common Tariff, however, includes a small number of "suspended duties" which are of a protective nature and may be imposed by Proclamation either in part or in full in any or all of the territories.

The general duty rating under the Common Tariff is 20 per cent. ad valorem based on the landed value at the port of entry, building materials, artisans' tools, and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on such articles as readily lend themselves to this form of assessment and in certain cases alternative specific or ad valorem charges are levied. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, packing materials, disinfectants, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, and many articles necessary for road construction, sanitation, irrigation and drainage purposes, and for the agricultural, industrial, and educational development of the territories.

The Customs Tariff (Amendment) Ordinance of the 24th October, 1934, introduced modifications of the specific duty ratings on piece goods and certain other textiles, boots and shoes, and bicycles and tricycles, the alternative ad valorem ratings of 20 per cent. being unchanged. The revised ratings are as follows:

| Article | Duty |
|---------|------|
| Apparel and blankets— |
| Blankets. | Each, 30 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Boots and shoes of which the soles are made of rubber and the uppers of canvas and/or leather. | Per pair, 40 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Cardigans, jerseys and pullovers. | Each, 35 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Shirts. | Each, 35 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Piece goods— |
| Cotton, grey and unbleached, not elsewhere specified. | 10 Cents per square yard or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Other (including scarves, shukas, chadders, khangas, bedspreads and the like), made of cotton or admixtures of cotton with other material not elsewhere specified. | 12 Cents per square yard or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Made of silk or artificial silk or of materials containing silk or artificial silk. | 20 Cents per square yard or 20 per cent ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Bicycles and tricycles, n.e.e. | Each, Shs.12, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |

Parts and accessories of bicycles and tricycles were removed from the general ad valorem rating of 20 per cent., certain specified parts being subjected to alternative specific ad valorem ratings as follows:

| Article | Duty |
|---------|------|
| Parts and accessories of bicycles and tricycles (not including rubber tyres or tubes when imported separately), viz.: |
| Frames, including front fork and back stay. | Each, Shs. 6, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Frames, excluding front fork and back stay. | Each, Shs. 4, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Front forks. | Each, Shs. 1/25, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Back stays. | Each, 75 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Handle bars (with fittings or otherwise). | Each, Shs. 1/50, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Saddles. | Each Sh. 1, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Rims. | Each, 40 Cents, or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Chains. | Each, 40 Cents or 20 per cent. ad valorem, whichever is higher. |
| Other parts | 20 per cent., ad valorem. |

Other minor modifications of the tariff were the transfer to the free list of batching oil and ingredients thereof, and of mineral mixtures for stock feeding containing 70 per cent. of one or more of the following ingredients: Calcium, phosphoric oxide, iron, iodine.

Under the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Ordinance of the 27th June, 1935, the specific duties on imported tobacco and cigarettes were increased by cents 25 per lb. to Shs. 1/65 per lb., the alternative ad valorem rating of 82½ per cent. remaining unchanged.

The Excise Duties (Amendment) Ordinance, 1935, enacted concurrently with the Customs Tariff (Amendment) Ordinance, 1935, imposed increases in the Excise duties on the locally manufactured tobacco and cigarettes as follows:

- Tobacco, increased from 50 cents per lb. to Shs. 1/25 per lb.
- Cigarettes, increased from 75 cents per lb. to Shs. 1/25 per lb.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of Trade Imports (excluding imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports, were as follows:

| Year | Trade Imports | Trade Exports | Customs Receipts | Tonnage |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------------|---------|
|      | £             | £             | £                | Tonnage |
| 1927 | 7,851,611     | 6,952,718     | 1,176,077        | 1,703,896 |
| 1928 | 8,747,777     | 8,764,671     | 1,345,170        | 1,814,731 |

| 1931 | 5,092,026     | 5,605,943     | 1,002,001        | 1,800,701 |
| 1932 | 4,662,859     | 5,870,708     | 880,520          | 1,684,696 |
| 1933 | 4,686,022     | 7,307,296     | 874,055          | 1,820,709 |
| 1934 | 5,424,420     | 7,505,142     | 979,022          | 1,902,356 |

Communications.

The Union Castle Line and the British India Steam Navigation Co. maintain a monthly service of passenger steamers from and to London. The Union Castle vessels run either via the Cape or Suez.

The Messageries Maritimes from Marseilles to Madagascar call fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The Tirrenia have two lines calling monthly; one steamer running as far as Zanzibar, and back to Genoa, and the other as far as Durban, and also back to Genoa, calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland.

The Navigazione Libera Triestina Line also maintains a north and south service with Italian ports.

The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintains a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool; also a service from the U.S.A. and Canada.

The Holland Afrika Line maintains a fortnightly service from London and continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this Port.

The Deutsche Ost Afrika Line maintains a three-weekly passenger and cargo service between Mombasa, Continental ports and Southampton.

The Osaka Shosen Kaisha Line connect monthly with Japan.

India-Africa Line (Andrew Weir & Co.) connect monthly with India and South Africa.

American South African Line (Inc.) connect U.S.A. monthly via S.A. ports.

Robin Line connect U.S.A. monthly via S.A. ports.

A fortnightly Mail Service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company's passenger and cargo steamers. The North bound ships connect at Bombay with the P. & O. mail steamers to England.

A monthly passenger service is maintained with Batavia via southern ports by the Royal Packet Company of Holland.

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by an Inter-Colonial Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Territory (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway. The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches open to traffic at the end of 1934 is 1,625 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings.

The Railway Marine consists of the Lake Victoria, Lake Kioga, Lake Albert, and River Nile flotillas. Their respective strengths are as follows:—

Lake Victoria, 4 Steamers, total displacement 4,246 tons.
5 Tugs and 1 Launch.
1 motor vessel (Kagera River Service).
32 Lighters, total capacity 3740 tons.

Lake Kioga, 3 Sternwheel Steamers.
1 Launch.
18 Lighters, total capacity 1900 tons.

Lake Albert and River Nile 4 Steamers, total displacement 1256 tons.
1 Launch.
4 Lighters, total capacity 270 tons.

The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda:—

Total Expenditure on Capital Account at the end of 1934 ... 22,321,569l.
Revenue for 1934—
Railways ... 2,227,285l.
Harbours ... 332,755l.
Ordinary Working Expenditure excluding Loan and Redemption Charges, for 1934—

Railways ........................................... 994,287l.
Harbours ............................................. 132,166l.

No. of Passengers carried ......................... 484,138.
Goods carried (Revenue earning) ............... 756,832.
Total Steamer Mileages (all three services) .... 146,498.

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the Port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now entirely used by dhows. Kilindini Harbour has been the scene of intensive development during recent years, and some 3½ million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lighterage quay, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 3,000 feet. This quay can accommodate six ships alongside of the normal type using the port. The quay is served by 25 electric level-luffing cranes and there are five transit sheds, three of which are double storey. The total number of quay, shed and stacking ground cranes are 82 up to date. A jetty at which bulk oil ships discharge to tanks ashore is now in use. A Harbour Advisory Board advises the High Commissioner for Transport on Port Matters.

Kilindini Harbour, at the Port of Mombasa is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by small shallow draft steamers. The bar at Kipini is an obstacle to navigation from the sea.

The Port of Kilifi consists of a land-locked Harbour, 30 miles North-East of Mombasa. It offers good anchorage for small vessels, and opens out into the Bandari Ya Wali, a bay about one-and-half miles wide, with shallow anchorage.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Kilifi.

The Port of Malindi is an open Harbour, 60 miles North East of Mombasa. Ships of any size can anchor off Malindi, but the anchorage is very exposed to the Monsoons. Cotton, Sim sim, and Copra are exported.

A District Officer resides at Malindi.

About three miles North of Malindi is the mouth of the Sabaki River. This river, which has recently been bridged about a mile from its mouth, passes through a country of great fertility, but is shallow and only navigable by canoes.

The Port of Lamu lies between Lamu and Manda Islands, 140 miles North-East of Mombasa. The town of Lamu, the most important Coast town North of Mombasa, is situated on Lamu Island. There is a good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, but the bar carries only 15 feet at low water. The exports are cocoanuts, copra, rope, mat bags, and some cattle.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Lamu.

Telegraph communication exists with Uganda and Tanganyika Territory. The Kenya telegraph system is also linked up via the Tanganyika Territory, Nyassaland and Rhodesian systems with the South African service. Communication with the Belgian Congo is maintained through Uganda, with which the Belgian Congo system is linked up.

Civil aviation continues to show rapid development in the Colony. Customs Aerodromes have been established and are maintained by Government at Mombasa, Nairobi and Kisumu. Approved landing grounds are also maintained by Government at Naivasha, Voi, Lamu, Nyeri and Kakamega. There are licensed landing grounds at Njoro, Eldoret, Kitale and Nakuru, the three latter controlled by their respective Municipal Councils. In addition there are fourteen Government controlled civil emergency landing grounds and nine privately-owned and unlicensed.
