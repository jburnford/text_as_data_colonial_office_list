THE GAMBIA.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst or St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, which latter is a sandbank about three and a-half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, and is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel, called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is covered by a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The settlement on the River Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary's, British Combo, Albreda, the Cedet Mile, and McCarthy's Island. McCarthy's Island is situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and is 187 miles distant from the latter. It forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river.

The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton, maize, and a corn called kous. Of these, however, only ground nuts, hides, and beeswax are exported. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths called pagns, there are no manufacturing industries worth the name in the country.

In the early part of the year 1881 an expedition (The Upper Gambia Expedition), under the command of Dr. Gouldsbury, Administrator of the Gambia, set out from the settlement for the purpose of examining the upper river, with a view of ascertaining its capabilities as a highway for trade between the coast and the interior, and also with the object of reaching Timbo, the capital of the extensive Futa Jallon country, and from thence returning to the coast at Sierra Leone.

The upper portion of the River Gambia was found to be extremely winding, and in many parts obstructed by rocks, sand banks, and shallows, and the country on either bank appeared to be totally destitute of inhabitants.

The expedition in its course crossed over the Gambia, the Grey River (a tributary of the Gambia), the Rio Grande, and the Senegal, and for several weeks travelled through a very hilly country, and along paths that were very rugged and steep. None of the countries traversed by the expedition were thickly, or even moderately populated, and the largest town met with (Toobah) numbered only about 800 huts. Timbo itself was found to be a rather insignificant town, having neither the extent, population, nor wealth ascribed to it by popular belief.

Taking into consideration the limited population, the great distances, the difficult roads, the frequency of native wars, the absence of industrial habits amongst the people, and the proverbial disregard of the native for the value of time, Dr. Gouldsbury came to the conclusion that but little increase of trade with the interior was to be anticipated, at least for a great number of years to come.

Treaties were made with several chiefs, and with the King of Futa Jallon, and the expedition was well received everywhere.

The expeditionary party arrived at Sierra Leone in the latter end of April, having taken exactly three months to accomplish the journey, and having travelled over a distance of about 1,000 miles.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants of Exeter to trade in the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the trade. It was not successful, and another established two years later experienced a like want of success.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, it appears that the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary's by British merchants from Senegal.

The Administrator of the Gambia exercises no jurisdiction over the population surrounding the British settlements.

The settlement was at first subject to the Government of Sierra Leone. In 1843 it was created an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. It became a portion of the government of West Africa Settlements by the charter of 19th February, 1866, and continues to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874.

The distances of the principal districts and British settlements are as follows:

WESTERN AUSTRALIA,

As defined by Her Majesty's Commission, includes all that portion of New Holland situated to the westward of 129° E. long.; its greatest length is 1,280 miles from north to south, and 800 miles from east to west.

The city of Perth is situated in lat. 32° S.

Western Australia was settled in 1829.

The Government is administered by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Senior Officer commanding the Troops, the Colonial Treasurer, the Surveyor-General, and the Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Railways.

There is a Legislative Council of twenty-one members. Seven are nominated, of whom three are official, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-
General, the Surveyor-General, and fourteen members are elected.

The electoral franchise is confined to householders of £10 in annual value, and the qualification for members is the possession, beyond all incumbrances, of landed property to the value of £1,000.

The colony is divided into ten electoral districts, the two principal towns, Perth and Fremantle, returning two members each.

The occupied portion of the colony is about 600 miles in length from north to south, by about 150 miles in average breadth.

The whole of the settled district, nearly the size of France, is usually level, often undulating, but never mountainous. The western seaboard is generally comparatively flat country, of a sandy character, composed chiefly of the detritus of old coral reefs, which has been again deposited by the action of water; further inland, a formation, which is here called ironstone, is met with; it appears to be chiefly a conglomerate of disintegrated granite, stained with iron; granite, slate, quartz, pipeclay, and, in places, trap, are all found in this country. The Darling Range, for instance, presents these characteristics; it runs from north to south in the central district inland of Perth, and appears once to have formed the coast-line.

The whole country, from north to south, excepting the spots cleared for cultivation, may be described as one vast forest; sometimes, but seldom, the traveller comes upon an open sand plain, covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and exquisite beauty, and often, especially in the northern and eastern districts, low scrubby trees and bushes fill the place of timber.

A very large proportion of this is heavy timber country. The jarrah, sometimes erroneously called mahogany, a tree of the Eucalyptus tribe, covers immense tracts of land; its timber is extraordinarily durable, and as it resists the white ant and the 'Teredo navalis,' it is admirably adapted for railway sleepers, and for piles for bridges and harbour works. It is hoped that, with increased facilities for transport, the trade in jarrah may be indefinitely increased.

The sandalwood already affords an article of export; the tuart and kari, Eucalypti of enormous size, are valuable timber trees; when standing they have been estimated to attain a height of nearly 300 feet from the ground to the topmost branch, thus emulating the great Californian 'Wellingtonia,' the kauri (Dammara Australis) of New Zealand, or the great Eucalyptus purpurea of Tasmania. Instances of trees attaining this height, however, are rare and exceptional.

The climate is one of the finest and most salubrious in the world, and the mortality of Western Australia, since its occupation, is said to have averaged not more than one per cent. From the northern to the southern extremity, the climate varies considerably; the southern temperature is somewhat similar to, but higher than that of England. The northern is hot but not unpleasant, the atmosphere being free from that moistness characteristic of tropical climates generally, and being tempered with cool breezes. The climate of the central portion of the colony is like that of southern Italy and parts of Spain. The seasons are divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in April and lasting till September; a greater part of this time of year, however, is bright and clear. The dry season is occasionally, but rarely, varied by showers or a thunderstorm. During three months of this period hot land winds occasionally prevail. The severe droughts and heavy floods experienced in the other Australian colonies are unknown in West Australia. The mean of the barometer is about 30 inches, and of the thermometer about 73 degrees. Exposure to all weathers produces no apparent ill effects on the constitution. Epidemic diseases are almost unknown, dysentery is a rare disease, and consumptive persons often derive great advantage from the climate. Snow is never seen; ice only early in the morning, and in the depth of winter.
