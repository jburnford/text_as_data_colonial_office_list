ST. HELENA.

St. Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. St. Helena is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad; its area 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres.

The capital is James Town, which is on the N.W. of the island. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°.

St. Helena was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1501. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden, of the English Navy, in 1673 took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 1833, when it was finally handed over to the British Government.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers returning from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, and the entire trade has, therefore, depended exclusively upon the large sums of money brought into circulation from the several sources above named. These have all been greatly diminished in recent years, in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal.

The number of ships calling at the port of James Town for supplies in 1878, including steamers and ships of war, was 669; in 1879, 602; and in 1880, 564; in 1881, 525.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council.
