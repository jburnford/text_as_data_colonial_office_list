QUEENSLAND.

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the colony of Queensland comprises 668,224 square miles, or 427,663,360 acres.

The native animals are of the same orders as those of the other Australian colonies, the marsupials being represented by the kangaroo, wallaby, pommelion, opossum, &c., &c.

The birds comprise a small species of eagle, kites, hawks, cranes, the great kingfisher, or "laughing jackass," emus, plain and scrub turkeys, parrots of brilliant plumage, cockatoos, &c., while wild duck, snipe, quail, doves, and swans afford sport for the gun.
Fisheries: the coast waters, bays, and rivers abound with excellent fish for the table, the flesh of some of the varieties, such as the gaud, whitling, sole, flathead, and silver bream being of great delicacy; while the deep-sea fish, viz., schnapper, king fish, Jew fish, albicore, and mullet resemble in firmness the cod and haddock of northern waters. The oyster banks not only supply the demands of the capital, but form an article of export to the southern colonies.

The dugong, a mammal inhabiting the bays, affords an oil which is much sought after, for its curative properties in lung disease; and its hide, when cured, makes excellent belting leather. The turtle also is to be found in numbers in the northern waters of the Colony.

Physical Features and Products,

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillers of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary, separating the rivers flowing eastward into the Pacific Ocean, and northward into the Gulf of Carpentaria, from those running westward and southward to the ocean, at the Great Australian Bight. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

There are several mountain ranges of greater or less altitude between the main range and the eastern coast, forming the watersheds of numerous rivers and creeks, and enclosing extensive valleys, where excellent pasturage is found for the flocks and herds of the settlers, although the grasses are deficient in the fattening properties which distinguish the herbage of the tablelands of the western interior.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Cotton cultivation promised for some years to prove remunerative to cottier-farmers, but since the discontinuance of the land bonuses given by the Government for its production, and the fall in prices consequent upon the renewed supply from the United States of America it has rapidly declined. The returns for 1881, however, show an increased acreage under cultivation.

The sugar cane has been successfully grown on the eastern seaboard, and the production of sugar has gradually increased, with some fluctuations, from the first year of its successful cultivation in 1867. The extent of land under sugar cane in 1881, was returned as 28,026 acres, and the quantity of sugar made during the year as 19,809 tons.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated most successfully in the neighbourhood of Warwick, on the Darling Downs. The statistical register shows the quantity of wheat returned as produced in the year 1881 as 89,612 bushels, yielding an average of 8·25 per acre, the crop having suffered severely from rust.

Agricultural and other Industry.

Agriculture in Queensland, though yet in its infancy, is gradually extending, and will no doubt continue to grow in importance with the steady increase of population.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and from the suitableness of soil and climate generally, and the great extent of the territory, this will no doubt continue to be the case.

There are 7,506 squatting "runs" or tracts of land containing 273,762,933 acres leased from the Government at a very low annual rental in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

In 1881 there were 475 new runs applied for, containing together 27,482 square miles, or 17,588,480 acres. Application was made in the same year for 280 "unwatered runs," as they are termed, containing 19,698 square miles.

There were 284 runs purchased at auction during the year from the Government, for 13,281l., at an average of 11s. 9d. per square mile. Together, the new runs acquired during the year were 787.

The average rate of rent per square mile on the available area of runs in what are called the unsettled districts of the country is 8·47 of a farthing per acre.

The importance of the pastoral interests will be seen by the value of the following exports connected with this industry for the year 1881:

| Item          | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Wool          | £1,381,869 |
| Hides and skins | 104,756 |
| Tallow        | 178,262 |
| Live stock    | 255,108 |
| Preserved meat| 54,248 |

Total, £1,919,243

Mining is likely to prove a great source of wealth to the Colony. During the year 1881 the exports of gold and other metals are given as follows:

| Metal | Value   |
|-------|---------|
| Gold  | £925,012 |
| Tin   | 193,699 |
| Copper| 19,637 |

Total, £1,138,348

The Gympie, Palmer, Hodgkinson, and Charters Towers gold fields still maintain large mining populations, and the yield from their reefs, although satisfactory, is not so favourable as would be the case if more scientific appliances were available for the extraction of the metal. There are lead mines in operation at Ravenswood, the ore from which yields a good percentage of silver. Cinnabar, anti-
mony, and manganese are also among the mineral products.

Near Gladstone, and on the adjacent islands, marble of fine grain is found, which at present finds no better use than being consigned to the lime kilns.

Considerable tracts of good pastoral country have also been found not far from the new route from Trinity Bay to the gold fields, in the same district, and in the western districts, on the Diamantina and Georgina Rivers.

Valuable timber of various descriptions grows in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hardwood, which is most in demand: blackbut, turpentine, iron bark, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, &c., &c. These woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The soft woods or timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: cypress pine, she pine, Kauri pine, Moreton Bay pine, silky oak, beech, satin wood, red cedar, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon.

Many of the indigenous plants produce excellent fibre for textile and cordage purposes; and no part of the globe is better supplied with fodders, there being about 200 varieties of native grasses, some of which are unequalled for their nutritious and fattening properties.

There are also a few of the native fruits which would be worth cultivation, such as the Herbert River cherry, the Davidson plum, &c., &c.

Excellent coal has been found in some localities; and there are other natural productions promising to add to the wealth of the Colony, but requiring labour and capital for their development.

Population and other Statistics.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; the estimated population on the 31st Dec., 1881, was 226,968.

There are 199 places now returned as proclaimed towns or township reserves, in the Colony, twenty-two of which are municipal towns, with an aggregate population of 84,856 persons, and containing rateable property valued at 7,019,134l.

Of the imports for 1881, the total value is given as 4,063,625l.

There are 6 banks with 91 branches. The value of the coin with bullion is given as 1,041,278l.; deposits 4,688,846l.; note circulation 405,756l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 20,168, the amount of deposits as 944,251l.

The railways in Queensland show 800 miles now in operation, the revenue being 318,128l. There are 233 miles of railway in course of construction.

The electric telegraph lines show number of stations, 170; miles of line, 6,280; revenue 43,940l.; number of messages (for the year 1881), 661,464.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, has a population of 33,068 resident within the municipal limits and suburbs. The mean external shade temperature there is given as 70°. The heat is great in summer, but the atmosphere is dry and healthy. In the winter the climate is agreeable. The mortality over a period of ten years from 1872 to 1882 was 17-22 per 1,000.

Immigration.

The European immigration for the year 1881 was 4,289. The arrivals from Hong Kong numbered 246, and from the South Sea Islands, 2,686; 1,639 immigrants from Europe were introduced entirely at the expense of the Queensland Government.

The land order system of immigration, by means of which as many as 36,000 persons were introduced from Great Britain in the years 1861-1866, a large number of them paying their own passages and bringing a great deal of capital into the colony has been discontinued. It is supposed that the present liberal system of disposing of the public lands of the Colony ought to be a sufficient attraction to the better class of immigrants from Europe likely to engage in pastoral and agricultural pursuits.

Land.

The vacant Crown lands in Queensland are dealt with under the provisions of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876. This measure is a consolidation of previous Acts, and differs in some respects from the Act of 1868, which was in force for eight years. For instance, classification of land into three classes, viz., agricultural, first class pastoral, and second class pastoral, is done away with, and a new system introduced of declaring the upset price when the land is proclaimed open to selection. Land cannot be sold for less than 5s. per acre, and in the case of conditional selections, ten years are allowed to pay the purchase-money.

A selector may obtain by conditional purchase not more than 5,120 acres, and not less than 40 acres, but the Act provides that in any district the Government may limit by proclamation the maximum area that one selector can secure, provided that the maximum shall not be less than 640 acres. Selectors of conditional purchases must expend a sum equal to the upset price up to 10s. per acre on the land, but not more than 10s. per acre is required under any circumstances. In addition to expenditure, the selector must reside personally or keep a bailiff on the land during the currency of the ten years' lease. After proof of three years' residence from date of selection and fulfillment of the conditions of expenditure, a certificate may be issued to the selector, which enables him to transfer his interest in the selection, if he desires to do so, or to pay up the balance of purchase-money and obtain a deed of grant.

The annual payments on homestead selections are 6d. per acre for five years. The area that can be selected under the homestead clauses of the Act is 80 acres in homestead areas, and 160 acres outside these areas. The land may be secured in fee simple by the homestead selector after a personal residence of five years, and proof of improvements of the value of 10s. per acre being effected on the land.

In homestead areas the area which can be selected under conditional purchase is limited to 1,280 acres, and under homestead selection to 80
acres. The homestead areas usually comprise land of the best class, and most suitable for settlement. All persons selecting in homestead areas must reside personally; the residence of bailiffs is not sufficient to entitle the selector to a deed of grant.

Pastoral runs in the unsettled districts of the Colony are leased for 21 years, in blocks of not less than 25 square miles, at a rental of 5s. per square mile for the first seven years, 10s. for the next seven, and 15s. for the third seven years, the conditions being the stocking of the land with sheep or cattle equal to one-fourth of its carrying capacity, which is defined by the Pastoral Leases Act of 1869 to be 100 sheep or 20 head of cattle per square mile.

The several Acts of Parliament under which land may be secured are "The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876," "The Settled Districts Pastoral Leases Act of 1876," "The Pastoral Leases Act of 1869," "The Mineral Lands Act of 1872," "The Gold Fields Act of 1874," and the "Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1876 Amendment Act (43 Vic., No. 12)."

"The Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868" was repealed on the 31st of March, 1876. Under its provisions, 4,658,251 acres were selected. There were 11,682 selections made under the Act; of these 3,036 were homesteads containing areas not exceeding 160 acres, 1,088 homesteads under the Homestead Areas Act of 1872 (now repealed), 7,228 conditional purchases, and 510 pre-emptions.

There are 34 land offices in the Colony, where conditional purchases and homesteads may be applied for.

The areas open to selection in the several settled districts of the Colony in April, 1877, were as follows:

| Lands open to selection at time of repeal of Act of 1868: | Acres |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Conditional selection                                    | 29,489,486 |
| Homestead areas                                          | 597,325 |
| Town reserves                                            | 398,160 |
| **Total**                                                | **30,484,941** |

Lands proclaimed open under the Act of 1876:

| Lands proclaimed open under the Act of 1876: | Acres |

| Conditional selection                       | 1,902,010 |
| Homestead areas                             | 833,850 |
| **Total**                                   | **2,735,866** |

Acres 33,220,801

The total area open to selection in the several land agents' districts on the 31st December, 1881, was 26,922,966 acres.

Under "The Western Railway Act of 1875," a reserve containing 18,440,000 acres was set apart in which blocks of land containing about 5,000 acres, or in cases where improvements had been effected on the land, in blocks of 10,000 acres, may be sold to defray the cost of the railway which is in course of construction at Roma. The first sale under this Act was held in March, 1877, when the proceeds realised 136,405l.

"The Railway Reserves Act of 1877" also establishes four railway reserves in addition to the Western Railway reserve; it embodies the same provisions* as "The Western Railway Act," viz., that the proceeds of the land in the several railway reserves are to be devoted to the construction of railways. There are four lines projected under this measure: 1st. An extension from Warwick to the northern border of New South Wales, through Stanthorpe, the principal town in the tin field; this line will be ultimately connected with the railway system of New South Wales. 2nd. The line from Maryborough to Gympie, one of the chief gold fields in the Colony. 3rd. The line from Bundaberg, a town at the mouth of the Burnett river to Tennyndering, or Mount Perry, near which there are several rich copper mines. 4th. The line from Townsville to Charters Towers, one of the northern gold fields.

Government.

The Government of Queensland is composed of the Governor, appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, and an Executive Council, composed of the responsible ministers of the Crown. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected by the suffrages of the people. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The franchise is on the most liberal footing, every man of 21 years, who has resided as much as six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 32 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act of 1878, the Colony is divided into 13 districts, each returning two members, and 29 districts each returning one member, or a total of 42 districts returning 55 members. The most northerly district in the Colony, Somerset, is as yet unrepresented. Queensland became a colony in 1859, the territory having been then separated from New South Wales.

*This provision was repealed by 43 Vic., No. 13, which directs that the proceeds shall be paid into the Consolidated Revenue.

**Public Debt**, on 31st December, 1881, 13,245,150L.

* For the years previous to 1875 the Treasury statements were made for the year ending on 31st December, but the revenue and expenditure for 1875 are only up to 30th June, the "Audit Act" of 1874 having altered the commencement of the financial year to 1st July. The subsequent returns of Revenue and Expenditure relate to the financial year ending on 30th June.

† These figures only show the value of the gold sent from the gold fields under escort, but a large quantity is sent by private hands, to save escort fees, the value of which it is impossible to form an estimate.
