VICTORIA.

Position.

Victoria, the most populous of the Australasian colonies, is situated at the south-east of the Continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

Victoria was separated from New South Wales in 1851. It is bounded on the west by the Colony of South Australia, the dividing line being the 141st meridian. On the north and north-east it is bounded by the Colony of New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass's Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and in the whole of Australia, is Wilson's Promontory, which lies in lat. 39° 8' S., long. 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is the place where the western boundary of the colony meets the Murray, lat. 34° 2' S., long. 141° E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated in lat. 37° 31' S., long. 149° 59' E.; the most westerly part is the whole western frontier, which lies upon the meridian 141° E. (as has been already stated), and extends from lat. 34° 2' S. to lat. 38° 4' S., or about 280 miles.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 570 miles, and by land 574 miles; from Adelaide by sea 482 miles, and by land 560 miles. Sydney and Melbourne are now connected by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained fortnightly by the subsidized steamers of the P. and O. Company.

Area.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres. The whole continent of Australia is estimated to contain 2,944,628 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about one thirty-third part of its surface. Great Britain, exclusive of the islands in the British seas, contains 89,644 square miles, and is therefore slightly larger than Victoria.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57°6'; the mean atmospheric pressure at 91-8 feet above the sea level was 29-93 inches; rain falls on the average upon 136 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25-65 inches.

Industry.

Wheat produced in Victoria, in 1881-82, was 8,714,377 bushels; oats, 3,612,111 bushels; potatoes, 184,290 tons; hay, 238,796 tons. The Victorian wool produced in 1881 amounted to about 45,970,600 lbs., valued at 2,702,780l.

The total quantity of gold raised from the date of the first discovery (1851) to the end of the year 1881, is estimated at 50,505,567 ozs., which at 4l. per oz. gives the value as 202,022,268l.

The number of acres under cultivation in 1881-82 was 1,821,719.

According to the census of the 3rd April, 1881, there are 275,516 horses in the colony; 1,286,267 horned cattle; 10,360,285 sheep; and 241,936 pigs.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The manufactories and works returned in 1881 num-
bered 2,469, the hands employed therein numbered 88,141; the value of raw materials used amounted to 8,012,745l.; and that of articles produced to 13,384,836l.; whilst the capital invested, so far as it is represented by the value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant, amounted to 7,465,328l.

There are 1,247 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation; also 159 miles in course of construction.

There are 8,360 miles of telegraph lines open, and 6,626 miles of wire.

Stage-coaches run to all parts of the Colony, except where railway communication is available.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city in Australasia, having, with its suburbs, according to the returns of the census of the 3rd April, 1881, a population of 282,947; though the first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, which, when the Legislative Council Act of 1881 comes into full operation, will consist of 42 members elected for fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 86 members returned by 55 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of 100l. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 25l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is under ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." The Members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipal bodies are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 82,181 square miles, or fourteen-fifteenths of the whole Colony. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the Members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the £, as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1881 there were 57 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 117 shires. The number of ratepayers was 199,104; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 7,175,289l., representing a value in fee simple of 87,642,459l.; the total income (including 368,363l. received from Government) was 1,014,960l., and the expenditure was 938,310l.
