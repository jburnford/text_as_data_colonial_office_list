THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

BARBADOS

Is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most windward of the Carribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 English miles long by 14 in breadth, and is said to contain a superficial area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found. In 1625 Sir William Courteuen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the leeward side of the island formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Carribbee Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour, and supported Sir W. Courteuen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river...
which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The leeward and windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. As in all new colonies, the inhabitants met with no inconsiderable difficulties. Local feuds were added to domestic privations, but the civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the power of the Commonwealth, he was banished. In 1662, after the restoration of Charles II, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim on Barbados, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners: it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, the principal of 11 parishes into which the island was divided at a very early date. This town contains, according to the census of 1881, 20,947 inhabitants, exclusive of the shipping, which amounted to 438. In 1861 a most important project for supplying the town with water was completed by a joint-stock company incorporated by an Act of the legislature. A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of Saint Andrew (23 miles as surveyed) has been commenced, and the first section was completed in October, 1881.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, which is much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. The works in connection with this harbour were formerly under the supervision of a legislative committee; but, by an enactment in 1870, its duties were transferred to commissioners, and in 1878 the Executive Council, and five Members of the House of Assembly, nominated and appointed by the Governor, were vested by Act with the care, management, and control of the Molehead and careenage. The control of these works was in 1881 vested in the Governor and Executive Committee.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as in the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 8 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation. A lighthouse was erected in 1852 on the south point of the island, partly at the expense of the British government. A harbour-light was also placed on Needham's Point in 1855. Another lighthouse was erected on the east coast (in St. Philip's), and lighted on 1st May, 1875, by a second order dioptric flash light, the latter given by the British Government.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. It is stated that, in 1868, there were 358 sugar-works in operation. At the present time they number over 500. The produce of 1871 amounted to 58,800 hogsheads of sugar and 33,500 puncheons of molasses; in 1876, 37,848 hogsheads of sugar, and 24,001 puncheons of molasses. In 1881 the produce amounted to 52,236 hogsheads of sugar and 33,521 puncheons of molasses.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 185,939; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 showed a total of 152,727 inhabitants. By the census of 1871 there were 162,042 inhabitants, of whom 16,560 were white and the remainder coloured and black; the natural increase having been checked by the migration to other West Indian Islands of large numbers of the labouring population. By the census of 1881 the population is returned at 171,889. Where so great a population exists, great industry is essential to enable the people to live. Thus, labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

From an early date, each of the 11 parishes of the island was presided over by a clergyman of the Church of England; but it was not till 1824 that the Bishopric of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, with British Guiana, was created. In 1842, upon the resignation of Dr. Coleridge (the first bishop), British Guiana and the Leeward Islands were separated from the Windward, and constituted distinct sees. There are at present in the island, besides the bishop, 43 clergymen of the Church of England.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S. P. G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30l. per annum from the College funds, and four Island Scholarships at 40l. per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives. Barbados possesses a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation endowed many years ago, which has been liberally supported by the legislature, and promises useful results. It has a staff of 6 university men as Masters, a Professor of Chemistry and Agricultural Science, and a Professor of German. The average number of pupils is about 140. There are four Barbados Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, each of the annual value of 175l., tenable at Oxford or Cambridge for four years. Besides these scholarships there are grants in aid to the successful competitors for the Gilchrist and Pembroke scholarships of 75l. each per annum for three and four years respectively. The Gilchrist scholarship has been gained eight times in nine years by natives of Barbados.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1855 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police, and a Corps of Writ Officers added to the Force.
An inland Post Office was first set on foot in 1852; it has since been amalgamated with the General Post Office, whence are delivered all letters, including those from beyond the seas. Through this office a letter may be sent to any part of the island, reaching its destination the same day, for 1d. the ½ oz. Money Orders are granted by the General Post Office upon all Money Order Offices in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands) and vice versa. The Postmaster is furnished with a list of these offices. Money Orders are also drawn on Demerara, Trinidad, and the Windward Islands.

Barbados is in the International Postal Union. A lunatic asylum and a lazaretto are kept up at the public expense: and there is a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the colony contributes £6,630 per annum.

The deposits in the Savings Bank amounted, on 31st December, 1881, to £29,400. The number of depositors was 3,469. Branch savings banks have been opened in the rural districts.

There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados.

The island forms the head-quarters of Her Majesty's forces in the West Indies command, under a major-general, who resides in Barbados. The troops stationed in the island are garrisoned at St. Ann's, situated at the southern extremity of the city.

Volunteer rifle, artillery, and yeomanry-cavalry corps were organized in 1859, but were disbanded in 1868.

The Local Government of Barbados consists of a Governor (who is also Governor-in-Chief of St. Vincent, Grenada, Tobago, and St. Lucia), an Executive Council, consisting of the Governor, the officer commanding the troops, Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, and such other persons as may be appointed by the Queen; a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly, composed of 24 members elected annually. The non-official members of the Legislative Council are appointed by warrant under Royal Sign Manual, and hold office during pleasure. The Legislative Council has a concurrent voice in making laws with the Governor and Assembly. In former years almost every judicial function in the island was executed either collectively or individually by Members of the Council, who composed the Court of Chancery, the Court of Error, and discharged in rotation the office of Judge of the Criminal Sessions, till the year 1841, when a Chief Justice was appointed. Exceptions to parish rates are heard and determined by the Chief Justice, but the assessments must be confirmed by the Governor in Council before they are levied. The Assembly consists of two members for Bridgetown, and two for each of the eleven parishes, and its duration is limited to twelve months. The qualifications of Members and Electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, passed in 1840, and are as follows for Electors:

1. Possession of estate for life, or, in right of marriage, of not less than the annual value of £21,16s. 6d., or interest in rents and profits of land of a similar amount.

2. Lessee or assignee of lands or tenements when the rent shall not be less than 64l. 2s. 0½d., and the term of lease was in its original creation of not less than five years.

3. Occupant in any town of any house or premises parochially rated at not less than 32l. 1s. 0½d. per annum.

4. Payment of parochial taxes for two years to the amount of 3l. 4s. 0½d.

The number of registered electors was 1,635 at the close of 1879.

In addition to their legislative functions, the Members of Council and Assembly used to be called upon to discharge various executive and administrative duties, which devolved on Committees either named by the senior Member of Council and the Speaker respectively, or, in a few instances, selected by the Governor.

By an Act passed early in 1881, provision was made for the establishment of an "Executive Committee" to supersede the administrative committees of the legislature, and to bring the public institutions under more effectual control. The Executive Committee consists of the members of the Executive Council, one member of the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly, appointed by the Governor. The Governor sits as Chairman. No money vote may be proposed to the Legislature unless sanctioned by the Governor in Executive Committee. The Governor in Executive Committee frames the annual and supplementary estimates, and controls all the public institutions, other than parochial, except the General Hospital.

ST. VINCENT.

The Island of St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land. Some of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from the mainland.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the bottom of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of 5,400 souls.

St. Vincent, though exhibiting some features in common with the other islands, is favourably distinguished from many of them by an undulating surface, and a succession of gentle slopes, of which portions are cultivated for sugar-cane. Its most striking peculiarity is its "Soufrière," or volcanic mountain, celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and is about 8,000 feet above the level of the sea.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island. In the meantime the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands. After that, the Caribs continued sole masters of St. Vincent until the year 1675, when a number of savages of a different race were discovered on the island. These received the appellation of "Black Caribs," to distinguish them from the aborigines, to whom the name of "Yellow Caribs" was given.

In 1722 George I made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of 63,625l.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the Island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Molville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. It took place on the 10th of October of that year, and extended its ravages chiefly to St. Vincent, Grenada, St. Lucia, and Martinique. The plantations were destroyed, the houses thrown down, and the loss of human life in the four islands has been computed at upwards of 20,000 souls. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but then the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overrun the country; burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the Zebra sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British head-quarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. The success which had attended the British arms in the reduction of St. Lucia inspired the inhabitants of St. Vincent with hopes of a speedy deliverance, and they were not disappointed. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the island of Rattan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

The planters who survived this protracted and desolating war found the Colony at its close in a sad state of destitution; and an application for relief to the Imperial Parliament by means of a loan, was favourably entertained. About this time Mr. Seaton resigned his post of Governor, and
was succeeded by Mr. William Bentinck, who arrived in June, 1802. The new Governor was authorized to grant occupancies of the Carib lands, during the King's pleasure, to all those who had been engaged in the late war; and this was followed in 1804 by an Act declaring that the Caribs had forfeited all claim to their lands under the treaty of 1773, and these were consequently re-vested in the Crown.

In 1809, Sir Charles Brisbane was appointed Governor of St. Vincent, in which post he continued till his death, in 1829. During his administration an impetus was given to agriculture and trade which soon raised the Colony to an unexampled degree of prosperity.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of Coolie labourers in 1861. There are about 1,800 of these immigrants at present located on different plantations in the island.

There are seventeen churches and chapels belonging to the Established Church, three Roman Catholic, eleven Wesleyan, and one Presbyterian churches.

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Council acted in the double capacity of a Privy Council and a Legislative Council. The Governor presided in the former, and the senior member, with the title of President, on whom also devolved the temporary administration of the Government on the death or absence of the Governor in the latter.

The Assembly was originally composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1842 the number of Representatives was increased to twenty-five, but by an Act of 1850 it was reduced to nineteen, as it originally stood.

In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor, and composed of three members, one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Committee held office during pleasure. Their duties were to advise and assist the Governor in the administration of the finances, and of the general affairs of the Colony; to act as a Board of Audit, and to have the charge of all Public Buildings; also to be the official organs of communication between the Governor and the Legislative Chambers. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years. On its expiring, in 1864, the Administrative Committee was not revived; but an Act was passed authorising the continuance of the Executive Council as a Council of Advice to the Governor. This Council was composed of members from both branches of the Legislature, appointed by and removable at the pleasure of the Crown. From this Council the Governor selected, at pleasure, any two members, being members of the House of Assembly, to act as the official organs of communication between himself and the Assembly. The initiation of all money votes rested with these members, under the direction of the Governor, without whose assent, signified through one of them, no money vote could be taken. A separate and distinct office of Auditor of Public Accounts was at the same time created.

This constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony; and by Acts which received her Majesty's assent, and were formally proclaimed in the Colony on October 17, 1867, the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex-officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. It was presided over by one of its members appointed by the Crown, who had, in addition to his vote as a member, a casting vote upon an equality of votes.

The franchise was regulated by an Act passed and published concurrently with the Constitution Act. The qualification for electors was a freehold of 10l., a leasehold or tenancy of 20l., or an income of 50l. per annum. The number of electors registered under this law, for the year 1874, was only 388. Of these 166 claim to vote on landed qualification, and 206 on income qualification.

But this Constitution, also, has been abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47), by which the future modelling of the Constitution was left to the Crown. By an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, Her Majesty has declared that the Legislature is to consist of the Governor for the time being, and such other persons, not fewer than three, as She may designate by instructions or warrant.

In 1868 the Executive Council Act was modified, and the Council may now be composed as the Crown may direct.

The Supreme Court for Civil Causes was formerly called the Court of King's Bench and Common Pleas, but is now styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. It is presided over by the Chief Justice, with whom are associated three Assistant-Judges, not professional men, receiving no salary, but entitled to certain fees.

The court for the trial of criminal offences is styled the Court of Grand Sessions of the Peace, and is held four times a year. The Chief Justice, the Assistant-Judges, and the members of the Executive Council are Judges of this Court.

In 1854 the benefit of the Encumbered Estates Act was extended to St. Vincent; and in 1859 the Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands was duly inaugurated. This Court is composed of the Chief Justices of the Islands of Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, St. Lucia, Tobago, comprising the Government of the Windward Islands. The registration of all real property is required to be made in the office of the Colonial Registrar, who is also Secretary of the Courts, Registrar in Chancery and in Ordinary, and Clerk of the Crown.

GRENADA.

Grenada is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 76,588 acres, with a population, by the Census of 1881, of 42,403 souls. It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and between it and the latter island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, partly attached to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 3,071 souls.

The country is mountainous and very picturesque, and abounds in streams and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, 7 miles from St. George, and Lake Antoine are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. The chief productions of Grenada are sugar and cocoas, and those of Carriacou are cotton, ground provisions and live-stock.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the Colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. Major-General Edward Mathew was appointed Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Grenada and of Carriacou, and from that date to this time the government of Grenada has been confined within these limits. In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation.

In 1854 an Act was passed regulating the election of members of Assembly. The House of Assembly was to consist of 26 members, of whom 4 were returned for the town of St. George, 7 by the united parishes of St. George and St. John, 6 by the united parishes of St. Patrick and St. Mark, 6 by the united parishes of St. Andrew and St. David, and 3 by Carriacou.

The Assembly was elected for seven years.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members selected by the Crown from the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. During the continuance of this Act the executive functions of the Legislative Council ceased, and were exercised by the new Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members receive each a salary of 100l. a-year, and are charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vic., c. 47) which has been mentioned in the previous article (St. Vincent), empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council has been established by the Queen, consisting of the Governor for the time being, and such persons, not fewer than three, as Her Majesty may designate by instructions or warrant.

TOBAGO.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1626 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1645, James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1648 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1659 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole Island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce, but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillie, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In March, 1793, it was captured by a British Force under Admiral Laforey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803, by Commander Hood and General Greenfield; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9', W. long. 60° 12'; distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 20 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Trinidad by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N. in 1865, is 181 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 32 miles long and from 6 to 12 broad, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,280 acres.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 20 miles in length.

Sugar, rum, and molasses form the principal articles of export. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 10 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town has a population of about 1,200. The mails and passengers from the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's vessels are landed at Scarborough. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, has good anchorage, and the only danger is from a rock called the Beef Barrel, and frequent heavy surfs. There is a lighthouse at Bacolot Point Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

The Government is administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Barbados. There were formerly two Legislative Houses,—the Legislative Council and the Elective Legislative Assembly. The Council was composed of seven members, appointed by the Queen.

The Assembly consisted of 16 members, elected by the registered voters of the seven parishes into which the island is divided, each parish returning two representatives, and the towns of Scarborough and Plymouth one each.

The first constitution was given to the Colony in 1769, and the seat of the Legislature transferred from Georgetown, Barbados Bay, to Scarborough. The constitution was remodelled in 1865 by a local Act, Vict. 18, cap. 7, entitled "An Act for the better Government of this Island," which, in addition to the Legislative Council and Elective Legislative Assembly, established a Privy Council and an Executive Committee.
The Executive Committee consisted of one Member of the Legislative Council and two Members of the Elective Legislative Assembly, selected by the Lieutenant-Governor, and holding office during pleasure. Their duties were to advise and assist the Governor in the general administration of the affairs of the island, and to prepare and perfect all estimates and ways and means. They were the official organs of communication between the Governor and the respective Legislative Chambers. They formed a Board of Audit of Public Accounts, and were also Commissioners under the Hurricane Loan Act. They received a salary of 100l. per annum each, and had a Secretary receiving also 100l. per annum. The Members of the Executive Committee sat as Privy Councillors in virtue of their office, but ceased to be Members of the Privy Council on their retirement from the Executive Committee.

The constitution was further remodelled by an Act No. IX of 1874, which abolished the two Legislative Houses, and established in lieu thereof one Legislative Assembly, consisting of six Members nominated by the Government and eight elected,—one by the town of Scarborough and one by each of the seven parishes, the qualification of electors remaining the same as before. The Privy Council was continued and the Executive Committee, which however was reduced to two Members, one a nominee Member of the Assembly, and the other an elected Member. And their emoluments were reduced to 50l. a-year each. The Legislative Assembly thus created, has since abolished itself and empowered Her Majesty to constitute a Legislature for the Island. This Act has been ratified by the Imperial Act 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47 (alluded to under previous articles, St. Vincent and Grenada). A Legislative Council has been established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

Riots occurred in the Windward District in May, 1876. Forty-two persons concerned in these riots were indicted for murder, of whom sixteen were sentenced to death. They were all subsequently reprieved and sentenced to various terms of penal servitude. In consequence of these riots, the Police Force was reorganized and increased in numbers, and made a semi-military force.

The moneys in circulation are British gold, silver, and bronze coins, doubloons, and American eagles and their fractions, with Colonial bank notes. The weights and measures are the British imperial.

ST. LUCIA.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 42 miles in length, and 21 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is one hundred and fifty miles, and its area 158,620 acres. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 900 houses, and a population of about 4,555 souls. Next in importance is the town of Soufriere, containing a population of 2,286 souls.

At the period of its discovery, St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to M.M. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to M.M. Homel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent d'Orléans made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-le-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Ilet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms, on the 4th of April, 1794, on which day H.R.H. the Duke of Kent, father of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, placed the British colours on the principal fortress.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

Sir John Moore, the future hero of Corunna, who greatly distinguished himself in this campaign, was appointed Governor of the island, which post he held till the beginning of 1797.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. However, each census shows an improvement in this respect, and the population now amounts to 38,551. The registration (instituted in 1869) exhibits an annual excess of births over deaths of about 600, or nearly 2 per cent. of the population.
— a fact which shows that the reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is completely undeserved. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation. Among the 900 or thereabout of white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are unknown. Probably no climate in the world is more suitable as a winter resort for invalids suffering from chest complaints. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera.

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Sénéchausée," and a higher Court called the "Conseil Supérieur" or Court of appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council of two members. The Legislature consists of the Administrator and a Council, in which he presides, consisting of five official and five unofficial members. Law is administered by a judge, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Windward Islands, and by three magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve as in England.

Immigration from the East was resumed in April, 1878, and there is at present in the Colony an indentured Indian population of 1,213 souls.

A code of civil law, the authors of which are Mr. G. W. Des Vœux, C.M.G., the late Administrator of the Government, and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., the Chief Justice, was passed in November, 1878, and having received Her Majesty's gracious approval, became law in October, 1879. This code has been framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are conformable to the conditions of modern society, or are required by existing circumstances.
