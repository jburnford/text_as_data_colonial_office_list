TRINIDAD.

The island of Trinidad lies to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° of W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 21st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the kings of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.

Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the great preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The fleet was under the command of Rear-Admiral Harvey, and consisted of 18 vessels, carrying 760 guns. The military force, numbering in all 6,750 rank and file, was led by Sir Ralph Abercrombie.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Abercrombie, Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.
Trinidad was held for a few years as a military conquest, during which period it was governed by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton, Aide-de-Camp to Sir Ralph Abercrombie.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

**General Description.**

The soil is varied, and extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. Coffee has of late been largely cultivated, and with great success, bidding fair to become a very considerable factor in the future exporting power of the colony. Tobacco of a superior quality is also largely grown.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the past nineteen years has been 66-39 inches. The mean temperature during the same period was lowest at 76°.1 Fahr. in January, and highest at 79° Fahr. in September and October respectively.

The chief town and principal port of Trinidad is Port of Spain (population 31,858), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population 6,835), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

The harbour is the finest in the West Indies.

A pitch lake, 90 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value, and yields a slight revenue to the island.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,125,000 acres, the alienated acreage is given below, according to the last assessment:

| Cultivated in Sugar Cane | 52,150 |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Cacao and Coffee         | 21,279|
| Ground Provisions        | 16,986|
| Cocoanuts                | 2,885 |
| **Total in crop**        | **93,300** |

| Pasture                  | 6,108 |
| Uncultivated             | 154,108|

**Total alienated** 253,511

The population of the island was ascertained by the Census of 1881 to be 153,128.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers which ply daily, calling at intermediate points, and by the newly opened railway. The Gulf steamers proceed on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

**Railways.**

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Clayton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, and the further extension to San Fernando (7 miles), was opened on the 17th April, 1882. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways, between San Fernando and Savana Grande, and short lines at Chaguanas and in the Guaracara valley, used chiefly for the conveyance of sugar. These lines will no doubt become of greater importance when united with the main line.

The conversion of the Guaracara line into a railway is now in progress.

**Municipalities.**

The towns of Port of Spain and San Fernando are under the jurisdiction of borough councils, the former consisting of fifteen elective members, the latter of seven.

One of the members is annually chosen mayor.

**Postal Communications.**

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and 27 out offices throughout the island.

The money order system has been established between the United Kingdom and the island and the neighbouring colonies, and orders are issued at the General Post Office and at the San Fernando office.

Trinidad has joined the Postal Union.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad has within the last few years increased considerably, the number per month being now 17, viz., 2 royal mail steamers, 2 royal mail cargo steamers, 2 of the Transatlantic Company's steamers from St. Nazaire, 1 French cargo steamer from Bordeaux, 2 of the West India and Pacific Line, and one of the Harrison Line from Liverpool; 1 Clyde steamer, 2 of the Quebec and Gulf Line from America, and 4 steamers running between the island and Venezuela. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers.

**Coolie Immigration.**

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £6,472l. was expended in 1881, besides the fixed establishment of the department, the cost of which is about £4,000l. The number of Indian immigrants during each of the last three years was as follows:

| Year | Number |
|------|--------|
| 1879 | 2,619  |
| 1880 | 3,132  |
| 1881 | 2,655  |

**Defence.**

A volunteer corps was established in 1879, having 170 members in Port of Spain, and nearly half that number in San Fernando. There is also a Rifle Association.

The Police Force of the island consists of an inspector-commandant, two inspectors, one clerk, two sergeant-majors, 30 sergeants, 25 corporals, 25 lance corporals, and 270 constables. There is also a water police, with 2 coxswains and 8 policemen. The cost of the establishment is £25,791l. annually.

**Education.**

Education has made considerable progress in Trinidad for some years past. The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, aided only by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, the College of the Immaculate Conception. Attached to these institutions are exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £150l., each tenable for three years at some university in Great Britain or Ireland. Four of these exhibitions may be gained annually by such students of either College as pass the required examination. There were at the end of
1881 fifty students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and one hundred and thirty-seven on those of the College of the Immaculate Conception.

From the Government primary schools to the Queen's Royal College there are annually open to competition three free admissions, each tenable for three years.

The primary schools are now ninety-eight in number, fifty of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and forty-eight denominational and assisted. The Government schools are generally well supplied with school requisites; their furniture is constructed on good models, and some of them are held in creditable buildings. Fees are exacted and paid with great regularity, the usual rates being three pence per head per week; at some schools the charge is two shillings per month, and at the Model Schools five shillings per month. There is a reduction when the fees are paid quarterly in advance, and reduced rates are charged for the second and third children in a family. In connexion with the Boys' Model School there is a Training College for male teachers, which admits twelve resident and seven non-resident students. In connexion with the Girls' Model School there is a kindergarten department for infants. The staff of the Government schools includes 45 masters, 4 mistresses, 5 assistant masters, 48 assistant and work mistresses, and 85 pupil teachers, paid monitors, and normal students. There is an examination of teachers annually, the conditions of which are similar to those in force in England.

The number of pupils attending the primary schools was as follows:

| Year | Government Schools | Assisted Schools | Total |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1879 | 3,967             | 3,274           | 7,281 |
| 1880 | 4,446             | 3,808           | 8,254 |
| 1881 | 4,171             | 4,828           | 8,999 |

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private adventure schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. Under the Presbyterian Coolie Mission there are twenty estate schools, having about 620 pupils; so that it may be roughly estimated that the number of children attending school in Trinidad is about 9,000.

Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an executive council of three members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 6 official, and 8 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.
