CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.
The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is washed by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, on the northeast by the Orange Free State and Natal, and on the east by certain districts of Native Kaffraria still independent. The Cape Colony with adjacent territories (Basutoland and British Transkei) contains an area of 240,108 square miles, that of the Colony being 199,950, of Basutoland 10,293, of the Transkeian territories 12,065 square miles, and of Griqualand West, 17,800.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was separated from the Cape and constituted a separate Colony.
By an Act of the Colonial Legislature, No. 12 of 1871, the country known as Basutoland—which on the 13th March, 1868, had been proclaimed British territory—was annexed to the Cape, the Act being confirmed by an order of Her Majesty in Council. In consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the Basuto community, the Act of incorporation expressly declared—that Basutoland was not to be subject to the general law of the Colony, that the Government should have power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein. Affairs are administered by an agent representing the Governor.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879. As in Basutoland, the Governor is authorised to legislate for them by proclamation.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walwich Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn was proclaimed British territory.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, of which by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. A similar warrant had been passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory.

History and Conquest.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeek, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burgers, who were thereby continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795 Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince as conveyed to him by the British Commander, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid and considerable progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £50,000 to promote emigration to the Cape, by means of which 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole southeastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory. Subsequently Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, who thought the Kaffirs had had much excuse for their invasion, reversed this Act. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1856 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population, who had become so estranged from the British Government that they preferred the perils of the wilderness to remaining under our rule. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:—1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. 2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. 3. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the then Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive pur-
poses. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. The most important event in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which has undoubtedly been one of the main causes of the increase in recent years of the prosperity of the Colony. The measure of that prosperity may be judged from the fact that while the shipping inwards in 1870 amounted to 335,509 tons, in 1881, it amounted to 2,540,910 tons, and in the same period the imports, excluding specie, rose from 2,352,043l. in value to 9,227,171l.

The value of the exports in 1881 was 4,220,706l., excluding specie (208,402l.), diamonds estimated at 5,000,000l., and ships stores 100,000l. The gross weight (avoidedupois) of diamonds contained in packages which passed through the post office at Kimberley during the six years ended 31st December, 1881, is stated to be as follows:

| Year | Weight (lbs.) | Estimated Value |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1876 | 773          | £1,807,532      |
| 1877 | 908          | 2,112,427       |
| 1878 | 1,150        | 2,672,744       |
| 1879 | 1,174        | 2,846,681       |
| 1880 | 1,440        | 3,867,897       |
| 1881 | 1,498        | 5,000,000       |

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat never oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the most elevated localities and on the tops of the higher mountains.

In the Eastern province the chief rainfall is during the summer months, in the Western provinces during the winter months. The summer months may be reckoned from November to April.

Consumption, in its early stages, has been entirely eradicated by residence at the Cape, and patients suffering from the disease even in a considerably advanced stage, have lived many years in the climate of the Cape, after European doctors had given up all hope of their lives.

Diseases of the lungs are rare, and there is a remarkable exemption from cholera, fevers, &c.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Railways.

With the exception of a length of some ninety miles in Namaqualand, which is devoted exclusively to copper mining purposes, the railways of the Colony are the property of the Government. They are divided into three groups, starting from the coast at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London, and converging, generally speaking, towards Kimberley and Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State.

The mileage open for traffic on the 31st of Dec., 1881, was as follows:

| System         | Miles |
|----------------|-------|
| Western System | 401   |
| Midland System | 392   |
| Eastern System | 166   |
| **Total**      | 959   |

The rails are on the 3ft. 6in. gauge. The lines from Cape Town to Wynberg (8½ miles), and from Port Elizabeth to Uitenhage (8 miles), are double.

The appropriations for these lines amount to 9,208,844l., and the amount expended up to the 31st Dec., 1881, to 8,880,941l.

In 1873, when the first line constructed in the Colony, viz., that between Cape Town and Wellington, became the property of the Government, the revenue derived from railways amounted to 65,696l.; and the cost of maintaining and working the line was 42,768l. In 1881 the gross earnings on Cape government railways were 878,859l., as compared with 641,173l. for 1880, and the working expenditure 654,902l. as compared with 464,649l. for 1880, showing an increase for 1881, in the earnings, of 287,686l., and in working expenses 190,252l.

The profit on the workings for 1881 was 228,957l.

The extensions sanctioned by parliament in 1881 are all well advanced, and surveys have been made for carrying the main western line on to Kimberley, which has established itself as the great trading centre of the heart of southern Africa.

In addition to the lines constructed solely by the government, there is the line from Grahamstown to its seaport, Port Alfred, in course of construction by a company supported by a government subsidy; and the development of the coal measures of the Stormberg has led to the formation of a company, also supported by a liberal subsidy, for laying down a branch line of some 50 miles in length from the eastern main line to the coal fields.

Encouragement, by way of subsidy, is also offered for the construction of lines from Burghersdorp to Bethulie, on the Orange River, and from Cookhills, on the Midland Railway, to Somerset East.

The active movement in the direction of railway construction in the Orange Free State has been met by parliament in sanctioning the importation of material for the works through this Colony, free of duty, provided the Free State line is connected with the Colonial system.

Public Works other than Railways.

Harbour works on an extensive scale are being carried on at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Port Alfred (Kowie), and East London.

At Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, the works are under the direction of local boards appointed for the purpose. At Port Alfred and East London they are under the direct control of the Government.

The breakwater and docks of Table Bay were formally opened by H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh on 11th July, 1869, but have been actually in use for shipping purposes of the port from the 17th May, 1869. The cost of these works to the 31st Dec., 1881, was, for the breakwater, dock, &c., 843,777l., and for the graving dock 131,441l., making a total expenditure of 975,218l.

The breakwater is now being carried out to its originally fixed length of some 1,200 yards, the portion already completed being about 2,000 feet. The end of the year 1882 will see the graving dock opened for use. Its length is 510 feet. It is constructed throughout of granite, and is pronounced to be a high-class engineering work, capable of taking in ironclads and vessels of the largest class.

The number of vessels docked during the year 1881 was 905, registering 866,346 tons, against 800, registering 694,736 tons, during the previous year.

Extensive additions to the harbour works of Table Bay have been authorized, comprising an outer harbour, formed in part by the existing breakwater, which will enclose an area of 44 acres.
of water. The cost is estimated at £580,530. Parliament during 1882 sanctioned the raising of a loan of £200,000l. toward this sum.

The expenditure upon the harbour works at Port Elizabeth during 1881 was £81,249l., at East London £36,209l., and at Port Alfred £16,127l.

Considerable sums have also been expended upon other useful works, and upon opening of the road communications of the country. For these purposes the following sums have been appropriated for expenditure for the financial year, 1882-83: works and other buildings, £120,821l.; roads and bridges, £99,654l.

The Orange River is now bridged at four different points, viz., Hope Town, Colesberg, Bethulie, and Aliwal North. The bridge at Hope Town was opened only in the early part of the year 1882. The revenue in tolls derived from the bridges at Colesberg, Bethulie, and Aliwal North, during the year 1881, was £21,905l.

A contract for the erection of the superstructure of the new Houses of Parliament in Cape Town has been let to Messrs. Joseph Bull and Sons for the sum of £183,789l. The works are in a fair way of progress.

Telegraphs.

The system of telegraphs in the Colony (all the property of the Government) was considerably extended during the year 1881. On the 31st Dec. there were, exclusive of those on the lines of railway (961 miles), 3,260 miles open for traffic, carrying 4,535 miles of wire. There were, besides, 41 miles of private wire. The total cost of construction was £289,906l. The number of messages transmitted was 541,549, as against 398,277 for the year 1880. The revenue for the year was £91,426l., and the expenditure £48,791l., showing a surplus revenue of £47,635l., being nearly 16½ per cent. on the total capital expended, and 31 per cent. on the borrowed capital.

During the session of 1882, Parliament sanctioned further extensions of present lines representing a mileage of about 450 miles, at a cost of £36,865l.

The charge for transmission of ordinary messages is 1s. for ten words, and 6d. for every additional five, or part of five, words. Press telegrams are transmitted at one-fourth of the ordinary rates.

Minerals, &c.

Considerable advance has been made during the last year or two in developing the coal deposits in the Stormberg, on the north-eastern frontier. The coal is shown to be of a superior quality, and is found to be fairly suitable for railway purposes. Experiments are being made by Government with the view of testing the practicability of using it on the colonial lines. This coal is used freely for household purposes at Queenstown, and in other places in the neighbourhood of the fields.

The promotion of a company to work the mines, and to lay a branch line from the Eastern Railway to the coal pits, will doubtless tend to the rapid advancement of this industry, to the material benefit of the Colony, fuel being one of the most expensive articles of necessary consumption. The locality of the various deposits has lately been determined with some accuracy, by explorations conducted with a diamond boring apparatus imported by the Government.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper fields exist. The O'okiep Mine, the property of the Cape Copper Mining Company (Limited), is believed to be one of the richest in the world. The yield of ore in 1881 was 13,194 tons, valued at £261,000l. The percentage of copper is 38-00. Between this mine and the seaport (Port Nolloth), a distance of 93 miles, a railway of 2ft. 6in. gauge has been laid by the enterprising Company named, at a cost of no less than £158,100l.

The average annual export of copper ore is 13,000 tons.

A rich mine of manganese ore, yielding from 70 to 90 per cent., exists in the mountains opposite the Pearl, a town distant about 35 miles by rail from Cape Town.

Guano is found in large quantities on the various islets along the coast; and the collection and exportation of it forms a very remunerative industry.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The history of these Diamond Fields is briefly as follows:—The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin, and the existence of rough diamonds in South Africa was so generally discredited that nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of Her Majesty's 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and one of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery had been made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the four mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The largest diamond known to have been found was 288 carats. The highest price given for a single rough stone is 8,000l., being about 100l. per carat. The question whether the title of the proprietors of the farms entitles them to the sub-soil diamonds has been violently debated in the Province, and involving as it did consequences of great pecuniary magnitude to the diggers, at one time led them to acts of lawlessness which rendered necessary the despatch of a body of Her Majesty's troops to the Province to ensure respect for authority. The trouble was averted by the acquisition of the principal farm, Vooruitzigt, for 100,000l. by the Government; and as regards the minor diggings, the matter has now been set at rest by a legislative compromise.

The method of diamond seeking at the Dry
Diggings was at first of the rudest description. The chief reason for this careless mode of working was the absence of water available for washing the soil. Water, which was at first unattainable, has now to be pumped from the mines to keep the claims clear, and is also supplied from wells, which have been sunk in every direction. The result of this abundant supply of water has been the introduction of carefully devised machines for washing the soil—a process which not only increases the yield by revealing many diamonds which before passed unnoticed, but economizes labour, and renders theft impossible in the sorting.

As the mines sunk deeper the cost of working increased so enormously that the individual claim-holder was no longer able to work his claim economically, and the miner who worked with pick and shovel has been gradually supplanted by capitalists and wealthy and powerful corporations operating on the most extensive scale, with elaborate and costly machinery. Besides the engines engaged in the processes of hauling, pumping, and washing, the neighbourhood of the mines at Kimberley is now covered with a network of tramways, over which the soil from the mines is conveyed to the "depositing floors." These ways are of a uniform gauge of 18 inches, and the tram is an iron truck, holding a ton of soil. The locomotion is by horsepower, many hundreds of horses being employed, and several thousand trucks.

Kimberley is the great trading centre of the four principal mines, known as the Kimberley, Old de Beer's, Du Toit's Pan, and Bultfontein mines. The two former are the property of the Government, the two latter of the London and South African Exploration Company. The surface area of Kimberley mine is 23 acres, its depth nearly 400 feet; the surface area of De Beer's 29 acres, but the depth only 180 feet.

The mines of Du Toit's Pan and Bultfontein are considerably larger.

The number of claims is:

- Kimberley Mine ... 420
- Old De Beer's Mine ... 610
- Du Toit's Pan Mine ... 1,453
- Bultfontein Mine ... 1,003

A general assessment of the four mines has been put down at nearly 12,000,000l., that of Kimberley being 5,000,000l., and Old De Beer's 3,000,000l.

The number of steam engines employed is over 300, and the amount annually expended in fuel, for mining and household purposes, is estimated at 600,000l., exclusive of a considerable quantity of coal, which finds a ready sale at from 10l. to 15l. a ton. The number of natives registered as having been employed in the mines during the year 1881 is 79,926. The population on the fields was estimated, in 1881, at:

- Europeans ... 17,000
- Natives ... 22,000

The net weight of diamonds sent through the post office at Kimberley alone, during 1881, was 1,501 lbs. avoirdupois.

In September, 1881, a Commission was appointed to inquire into and report upon the laws regulating the working and management of the diamond mines of Griqualand West, and an exhaustive report was presented to Parliament during the Session of 1882. Time did not admit of any amendment of the mining law generally, but an Act was passed to regulate the trade in diamonds, and to check the illicit traffic in stones, which has proved so severe a drain on the resources of the mining industry.

**Other Industries.**

The colonists at the Cape are chiefly employed in the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and in the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of this Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked.

Ostrich breeding is now carried on with marked success in all parts of the Colony. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1881 it amounted to 193,612 lbs.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 403,158 lbs., and 4,146,128 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 42,770,244 lbs. in 1881.

Education.

To promote elementary day-school instruction of all children, industrial training for native lads and girls, and superior instruction to those preparing for the University examinations, the Government gives grants of money in aid of salaries of lecturers and professors (under the Higher Education Act), and of other teachers under Act 13 of 1865; assistance in providing furniture, &c., allowances in aid of expenses of needy boarders at schools amongst the agricultural population, and to maintain native boarders at industrial institutions. In 1854, 91 schools, at which 10,266 children attended, cost the Colony £7,593; while during the year 1880-81 there were in the Colony, the Transkei and Basutoland, no less than 943 schools with 72,281 scholars. The Government expenditure on education in the financial year 1881-80 amounted to £82,952L; as late as 1872 it was only £25,267L. The local expenditure was £91,725L, in 1881-82.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873, was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D., has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

Chancellor, Right Hon. Sir H. B. E. Frere, Bart., P.C., G.C.B., G.C.S.I., &c.

Vice-Chancellor, the Ven. Archdeacon Badnall, D.D., M.A.

The Council consists of 20 members. The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowments, &c. The following table shows the number of persons who—

| Matriculated | Took direct | Were admitted | ad eundem |

Sea and Land Communications.

Contracts have been entered into for weekly communication between England and the Cape, and vice versa, with the Union Steamship Company and Messrs. Donald Currie & Co. The packets leave England on Fridays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Tuesdays, the passage to be effected in 26 days, and in 27 days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena or Ascension, but premiums are paid for quicker runs. The average passage is 22 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed.

Steamers leave Table Bay three or four times a month for Natal (distant about 1,000 miles), calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; they usually leave about 36 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A Union Company steamer leaves Table Bay once a month for Delagoa Bay, touching at Port Elizabeth and Natal.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily, with Natal once a week, via the Transkei, and once via the Orange Free State, and with the Transvaal once a week through the Diamond Fields.

The number of Colonial post offices is 598, and of money order offices, 130. The expenditure on the postal service in 1873 amounted to £63,297, and to £90,345L 15s. 6d., in 1881; the revenue from postage in 1873 was £41,478, and from money orders £909, the corresponding figures for 1881 were £101,317L 15s. 2d., and £2,875L 8s. 6d. The weight of registered packets, addressed to England, and supposed to contain diamonds, which passed the Post Office in the years 1874 to 1881, both inclusive, amounts to 7,916 lbs.

Chief Towns.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 33,229, and with suburbs, 45,240, is laid out at right angles, and contains numerous handsome shops, offices, and churches. The finest building is the edifice containing the Library and Museum, the former of which has upwards of 40,000 volumes on its shelves.

Kimberley has a population of 13,590; Port Elizabeth, 13,040; Graham's-town, 6,903; King William's Town, 5,169; Paarl, 5,760; Graaff Reinet, 4,562; Worcester, 3,788; Queenstown, 2,320; East London, 2,184.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive
Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872. There is a Legislative Council of 22 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 72* elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary, (who is Premier), the Treasurer-General, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000, or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified by possession of property, or receipt of salary or wages, of not less than £50 per annum, or not less than £25. with board and lodging. The number of registered electors in 1881 was 55,784.

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided for in the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act No. 40, of 1882, consists of one Chief Justice and eight puisne Judges; and the Court of Appeal consists of a Chief Justice, the Judge Presidents of the Eastern Districts and High Courts, and two other Judges of the Supreme Court. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall territories known as Transkei and Griqualand.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. Several Acts for the more effectual defence of the Colony were passed during the session of 1878, viz., Burgher Force and Levies Act, Cape Mounted Riflemen Act, Volunteer Act, Peace Preservation Act, two in the session of 1880, viz., Colonial Forces Discipline Act and Cape Field Artillery Act, one in 1881, viz., the Cape Infantry Act, and one in 1882, viz., the Volunteer Act.

Native Affairs.

The condition and progress of the native population within and without the Cape Colony engages much attention.

Generally an increase of tillage, trade, and personal property is reported, and a growing desire for European clothes and other commodities of civilized life. The great vice of the natives is a tendency to brandy drinking. In the Transkeian territory stringent prohibitory regulations have considerably checked the progress of this vice.

Basutoland, the largest dependent native district, is about 150 miles long and 50 wide, and contains 10,293 square miles.

This land of mountain and grass is well watered and enjoys a delicious climate. The scenery is grand and in many parts extremely beautiful.

Population, 1875.—European, 469
Native 127,707

Stock, etc.—55,257 horses, draught cattle 28,626, other 188,791, sheep, wooled, 240,270, other 49,587, goats, angora, 13,592, other 147,162, pigs 15,237, ploughs 2,770, harrows 269.

Revenue, 1877-78—18,712l.; 1878-79—15,551l.; 1879-80—19,782l. (excluding advances).

Expenditure, 1877-78—19,772l.; 1878-79—31,155l.; 1879-80—25,021l. (excluding advances).

Its productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kafir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal has been found and is used in some parts.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, as explained in Part I of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and even invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C.D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British, by a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere dated the 5th of October, 1877, and confirmed by Lord Carnarvon in a despatch dated the 14th of November, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did so.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also proposed to include in the same scheme of incorporation the conquered province of Gcalekaland, and a settlement of British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvana-land, and Gcalekaland, were proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and Sir Hercules Robinson appointed Governor thereof.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umquikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, has ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River has been vested in Her Majesty's Govern- ment. A Resident has also been appointed to represent the Government with Umquikela, who remains Chief of East Pondoland. The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881, by which also it has been declared a "free port," and Sir H. Robinson appointed Governor thereof.
West Pondoland is under the Chief Umuquiliso, now independent of his uncle Umuikela. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

These various Transkeian Territories have been recently re-grouped, under three Chief Magistrates, each with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:

Griqualand East comprising Nomansland (late Adam Kok's Country), the Gatberg, and St. John's Territory, all under one Chief Magistrate,

the Hon. Charles Brownlee (late Secretary for Native Affairs), and eight subordinate magistrates.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, and Emigrant Tembuland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Elliot, C.M.G., and ten subordinate magistrates, who have also charge of the relations of the Government with Pondoland West.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, and the country of the ex-chief Kreli (Gcalekalan), all under one Chief Magistrate, Captain Blyth, C.M.G., and six subordinate magistrates.

Each of the three Chief Magistrates above-mentioned receives a salary of £1,000 per annum.

The following Tables contain the best available statistics relating to these territories:
