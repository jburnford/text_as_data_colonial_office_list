MAURITIUS.

An island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 17' and 57° 46' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., situated at a distance of 115 miles from Réunion, 940 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 708 square miles, having an extreme length of 36 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west.

The formation of the island is volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude, with peaks rising to nearly 2,700 feet. Some of these, such as Pieter Both and the Pouce, have fantastic shapes, and have been described as "fingers pointing to Heaven." The highest peak is the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, which is 2,711 English feet, but Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable beyond a few hundred yards from the sea.

This famous and beautiful island, the fairer "Malta of the Indian Ocean" (as it is called by Thiers, History of the Consulate and Empire, book 54), was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507, but the first people that occupied it were the Dutch, in 1598, who named it Mauritius, in honour of their Prince Maurice. The Dutch, however, though they built a fort at Grand Port, do not appear to have made any permanent settlement, and they finally abandoned the island in 1710. It was, in 1715, taken possession of by the French, at first, on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. The most celebrated of the French Governors was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1785—1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and was the real founder of the prosperity of the island.

Mauritius was during the earlier part of the long war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels and Indiamen, from the facility with which sorties might be made from it upon our traders by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.
Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of nearly 70,000 souls. The harbour is one of the best in the East. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The annual trade of the island (including imports and exports), which passes almost entirely through Port Louis, is valued at about six millions sterling, i.e., it is equivalent to the entire trade of England in the reign of Queen Anne, while the annual public revenue exceeds £700,000, i.e., it is equivalent to the entire public revenue of England in the reign of Charles II.

Constitution.—Mauritius is a Crown colony; the government consisting of a Governor, who is aided in executive duties by an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council of Government, consisting of certain public officers and unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

Dependencies.—The Seychelles Islands, Rodrigues, Diego Garcia, and about seventy other islands, scattered over a vast extent of the Indian Ocean, and containing a total population of about 16,000 inhabitants, are dependencies of Mauritius.

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the total number of acres comprised in this group is 50,120; the distance from Mauritius 940 miles. These islands are under the superintendence of a Chief Civil Commissioner (assisted by a Board of Commissioners) who is appointed by the Secretary of State, but is subordinate to the Governor of Mauritius, from whom he receives his instructions.

Rodrigues, the most important dependency of Mauritius after the Seychelles, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a civil commissioner (who is also a police magistrate), who takes his instructions from the governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made by means of regulations framed by the governor of Mauritius in executive council. The population on 3rd April, 1881, was 1,436.

The island, which is mountainous and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is very healthy, and the air fresh and bracing. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent; and, as about three days is the length of the voyage to Mauritius, Rodrigues would possess an immense advantage over Natal and Madagascar as regards the bullock trade if regular communication existed and the trade was encouraged. The soil is very good, and eminently adapted for all agricultural pursuits; wheat, oats, sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla have all been tried with great success, while yams, potatoes, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and almost all vegetables grow with little care.

During the time of slavery several fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years this industry has been much neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. Attention is now however being paid to the natural advantages of the island in this respect by capitalists from Mauritius. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit of all sorts abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard-apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and waxo trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Rodrigues was very serviceable to the British troops when Bourbon and Mauritius were taken from the French. The English troops were for a long time at the island; and again, later on, after the attack on Bourbon, the wounded were sent back there for recovery.

The island is celebrated for two caverns, in which the most beautiful transparent stalactites are to be found. The principal one is situated in the southwest. Its entrance is by a mouth in the face of high perpendicular rocks covered with ferns and bushes, while in front is a magnificent grove of orange, citron, and lemon trees.

The second and smaller one is about two miles south of the larger cave. The entrance is by a small hole in the surface of the ground, down which a descent is made from eight to ten feet to the floor of the cavern.

There is a well of fresh good water in each cave.

Climate, &c.—From December to April is the hottest season of the year in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature in the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The governor, the officer commanding the troops, and most of the official and other principal inhabitants, now reside in the charming climate of the uplands. The mean temperature at Curepipe, 1,800 feet above the sea, a place much resorted to of late years, and rapidly becoming a large town, resembles that of the South of France. The hurricane season extends from December to the middle of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 80° S. latitude. The longest days are at the December solstice, and the shortest at the June solstice. The difference of time between Greenwich and Port Louis is three hours, forty-nine minutes, fifty-eight seconds, the latter in advance of the former.

Scenery, Field Sports, &c.—The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an Engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the last century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The Botanical Gardens contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

Railways.—There are two lines of railway, the North Line and the Midland. The former runs between Port Louis and Grand River, S.E., a distance of 38 miles; the second line runs between Port Louis and Mahebourg, a distance of 85½ miles,
with branches to Savanne and Moka. The total number of miles of railway now open is 87. At Curepipe the elevation of the railway is 1,822 feet above the sea.

Telegraphic communication is established throughout the island.

Education.—The department of public instruction comprises two branches, the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under the control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent, aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported by the State; the grant schools only partially so. The following table shows the numerical strength of each in 1881:

| Number. | Pupils. |
|---------|--------|
| Government schools | 41 | 5,889 |
| Grant schools | 52 | 4,706 |

Total | 93 | 10,595 |

The annual vote amounts to about Rs. 250,000. There are about 180 masters and mistresses employed.

Of the pupils 73 per cent. are professedly Roman Catholics, 8 per cent. belong to the Church of England, the Hindus number 14 per cent., and the Mahomedans 5 per cent.

Currency.—All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is also the currency of the island.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Military Contribution.—Mauritius pays 40l. per head per annum for each infantry soldier stationed in the colony, and 70l. for engineers, artillerymen, staff, &c. The annual military contribution amounts to about 21,000l. a year.

Police.—The total police force on 31st December, 1881, was 697.

Sea Communications—A monthly service is carried on by the mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes between Mauritius and Marseilles, via Suez, touching at Réunion and Seychelles. The same Company's steamers leave Marseilles every four weeks for Mauritius. The passage to and fro averages 26 days, but it is expected that it will be soon considerably shortened. There is frequent communication by sailing vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, &c.
