SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

Geographical Position.

That portion of the Continent of Australia bounded on the east by the 141st degree of east longitude, on the north by the 26th degree of south latitude, on the west by the 132nd degree of east longitude, and on the south by the Southern Ocean, was constituted a British Province by Act of Parliament, 4 and 5 William IV., c. 95, under the designation of SOUTH AUSTRALIA. The area contained within those limits is estimated to be 300,000 square miles. In 1861, the territory known as "No Man's Land," about 80,000 square miles, lying between the boundaries of South and Western Australia, was added by Act 24 and 25 Vic. c. 44, making the western boundary the 129th degree of east longitude.

All the country north of the 26th parallel of south latitude, between the 129th and 138th degree of east longitude, has also been annexed to South Australia, and is known as the Northern Territory. The present northern boundary is the Indian Ocean, latitude 11° S.; the southern boundary, the Southern Ocean, in latitude 38° S. The Province of South Australia covers twenty-seven degrees of latitude, and twelve degrees of longitude, forming, at present, the largest British Colony—the area extending over more than 900,000 square miles.

The southern coast-line is deeply indented by two large gulfs—the eastern, St. Vincent's Gulf, running inland to the northward for 85 miles, and the larger, Spencer's Gulf, running N.N.E. for 180 miles. These gulfs have a mean breadth of 30 and 50 miles respectively, and both taper towards their northern ends. St. Vincent's Gulf is sheltered by Kangaroo Island, 90 miles in length, which lies to the southward of it, leaving two fine entrances, one from the westward through Investigator's Straits 28 miles broad, and the other from the eastward through Backstairs Passage 8 miles in width.

The principal agricultural and mineral districts of the Colony, are contiguous to the two gulfs, the shores of which are 780 miles in length, the greater part being entirely protected from the ocean swell. Numerous outports and shipping places, of which there are over 50, enable settlers to ship their produce at a very small cost. These gulfs are divided by Yorke's Peninsula, some 120 miles long, and 20 miles broad, having large tracts of wheat-growing land, and the principal seat of mining industry.

Adelaide, the capital of the Province, is situated about five miles from the eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, in latitude 34° 57' S., and longitude 130° 38' E., and Port Adelaide, the principal port, is about seven miles north-west from the city, and connected therewith by rail.

General Government.

The Constitution granted to South Australia by Her Majesty, by virtue of Imperial Act 13 and 14 Vic., c. 59, was proclaimed on the 24th October, 1856, on which day the Queen's assent to the Constitution Act No. 2 of 1855-6 was received.
in the Colony. Under that Statute the Parliament consists of two Houses—the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly; the former being composed of 18 members, and the latter, at that time, of 36. In 1873 the electoral districts of the House of Assembly were increased from 18 to 22, and the number of members from 36 to 46.

The Legislative Council, which cannot be dissolved by the Governor, is elected by ballot, the whole Province forming one electoral district for that purpose. Each member is elected for twelve years; and every four years the six members who have been longest on the roll of the Council retire. The qualification for a member of the Legislative Council is that he shall have attained the age of 30 years, that he be a subject of the Queen, and that he has resided in the Province for three years. The qualification of a voter for this branch of the Legislature is that he shall be 21 years of age, a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and have been on the electoral roll for a period of six months. He must also be possessed of either a freehold of the value of £50l. or of a leasehold of the annual value of £20l., having three years to run, or with right of purchase, or be in occupation of a dwelling-house of the annual rent value of £25l.

The constitution of the Legislative Council is unaltered by the late amendment of the Electoral Act. The total number of voters for the Legislative Council is 30,196, or about 39 per cent. of the adult male population.

The House of Assembly, which is liable to dissolution by the Governor, is elected for three years; and of the 22 districts represented in it, three return three members each, eighteen two members each, and the other returns one member only. The Constitution Act prescribes no other qualification as necessary for a Member of the House of Assembly than that he shall be an elector. An elector's qualification to vote is that he shall be of full age, and have been six months on the electoral roll. The total number of electors on the roll for the Assembly is 57,627, or about 76 per cent. of the adult male population.

Responsible Government is carried on by six Ministers, members of the Legislature who form the Cabinet, and who are ex officio members of the Executive Council, namely, the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, Commissioner of Public Works, and Minister of Education.

Population.

The population of the Colony at the close of 1881 was estimated to be 286,324 persons; showing an increase during the twelve months of 6,457 persons.

The inhabitants of the City of Adelaide number about 38,479 persons, and of the suburbs 37,500, while about 75 per cent. of the whole population are resident in the country districts, and are employed directly or indirectly in the cultivation of the soil, or in the production of mineral and pastoral wealth.

The South Australian born preponderate; the next largest class being persons of English birth, Ireland, Germany, and Scotland coming next. The proportion of males and females in the settled districts is about equal.

About 85 per cent. of the whole population are members of Protestant Churches, and the remaining 15 per cent. are Roman Catholics. The Church of England is represented by 26 per cent.

Omitting children under five years of age, 81 per cent. of the population can read and write, 9 per cent. can only read, and 8 per cent. can neither read nor write. Of the rising youth, say from 15 to 21 years of age, 94 per cent. can read and write, 3 per cent. can read only, and only 3 in every 100 are totally uneducated.

The average birth-rate is 37·11 per 1,000 of the population. The number of marriages registered in 1881 was 2,308.

The average death-rate in South Australia is 13·90 per 1,000, as compared with 22 per 1,000 in England.

Immigration and Emigration.

In 1881, 19,552 persons arrived in South Australia, and 16,800 left it, yielding an increase of the population from this source of 2,752 persons. The sum proposed to be voted by Parliament for the introduction of immigrants during the coming year will be sufficient for the introduction of about 1,000 adults.

Education.

An Education Act, passed in 1875, provides that the management of public education should be committed to a Minister of Education—a member of the Cabinet. The education is secular, but not to the exclusion of the Bible; free to those who cannot afford to pay a small fee; and compulsory wherever practicable. Provision is also made for the establishment of model and training schools, of Boards of Advice, and for the systematic examination of teachers, their classification according to their attainments and proficiency, and for scholarships.

With a view of fostering and encouraging the growth of a comprehensive system of public instruction, the following grants of money and land have lately been made:—Towards the expenses of the Education Department, payment of teachers, &c., a yearly sum of 60,000l.; and a like amount for the erection of public school-buildings. 120,000 acres of the public estate were also granted to the Council, and provision made for setting apart 20,000 acres in future years. To the University of Adelaide, lately established, an annual grant of five per cent. on all sums contributed to the University from private sources (at present amounting to over 40,000l.), and also an endowment of 50,000 acres of land. For the maintenance of Institutes, and for the erection of buildings connected with them, the sum of 28,244l.

Public Worship.

The voluntary principle, or freedom of religion from State assistance and consequent control, was established in South Australia from the date of its foundation. The number of churches and other buildings used for public worship is 1,038; providing 178,239 sittings.

The number of Sunday Schools is 645, attended by 46,381 children, instructed by 5,639 teachers.

Administration of Justice.

The legal tribunals of the Province consist of a Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges; the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of which the Chief Justice is Judge; Circuit Courts at Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, Port Augusta and Gladstone, presided over by Judges of the Supreme Court; the Court of Insolvency, presided over by a Commissioner, who is a Stipendiary Magistrate; Local Courts of Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates; and Police Magistrates' Courts.
Local Courts of civil jurisdiction are established in all the principal towns throughout the Province, arranged in circuits, and presided over by Stipendiary Magistrates.

The annual number of convictions in the Supreme Court has averaged during the last three years 200, or less than one in every 1,000 of the population.

Land Transfer.

The Statute known as the Real Property Act of South Australia affords a process by which the transfer of landed property may be accomplished in as easy and cheap a manner as any ordinary commercial transaction. Where almost every man is a landowner, or is interested in land—either as vendor or vendee, lessor or lessee, mortgagor or mortgagee—dealings in real estate become a matter of almost every day occurrence. It may be said to be quite exceptional for an individual in South Australia not to be, more or less, personally interested in the establishment of a simple and inexpensive method of dealing with this description of property. There can be no question that the operation of the measure has been highly advantageous to the community. The total value of the lands brought under the operation of this law amounts to 12,830,750l. sterling.

Loans for Public Works.

Legislative sanction has been accorded from time to time for the raising of money, by way of loan, for the prosecution of reproductive public works—such as railways, tramways, waterworks, telegraphs, harbour improvements, and other public purposes. The amount of the Public Debt outstanding on 30th June, 1881, was 9,848,300l., and the total rate of indebtedness per head of the population was 37l. 13s. 9d. Against this liability, a sum of 4,616,219l. remains due to Government, for 3,306,880 acres of land sold under the credit system.

The earlier loans were issued bearing 6 per cent. interest, but those of late years bear 4 per cent. only. The present price of South Australian Four per Cents. is about par. Interest and redemption are payable half-yearly in London, on 1st January, 1st April, 1st July, and 1st October in each year. The currency of the bonds is generally 30 years.

Banking.

Nine banking institutions carry on business within the Province, all of which have establishments in the principal seaports and inland townships—numbering altogether 125 branches and agencies. The total average liabilities of the nine banks amount to 5,555,593l. 16s. 11½d., and the total average assets to 8,414,743l. 3s. 1d.

The Savings Bank is managed by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor, and has 50 branches. The total number of depositors 30th June, 1882, is 42,884; the average sum at the credit of each being 36l. 1s. 9d. The total deposits of the year amounted to 1,044,438l. 12s. 2½d., and the total funds of the institution to 1,568,712l. 1s. 2½d.—invested chiefly in Government securities and on mortgage of freehold property. In South Australia one in ten of the population is a depositor in savings banks.

Land and Occupation.

Excluding that portion of the Province known as the Northern Territory, the total area of South Australia is about 380,070 square miles, or 243,244,800 acres. It may be roughly estimated that not more than 250,000 square miles are at present put to profitable use. Agricultural settlement has not extended 150 miles from the coast; and pastoral occupation may be said to have reached no further than 500 miles—although squatters have lately taken up large areas of land discovered by recent explorations (lying chiefly on the route of the overland telegraph), and which are considered capable of carrying stock. Thirty-six counties have been proclaimed up to 31st December, 1881, embracing 58,946 square miles, or 37,725,440 acres. Of this large area only 8,866,707 acres have been alienated from the Crown—amounting, nevertheless, to about 34 acres for every man, woman, and child in the Colony, or upwards of 127 acres for each male adult. About one in every five acres of the alienated land is under tillage; the remainder is used for pastoral purposes only. All land is surveyed by the Government prior to sale, and is divided into farms of extent varying from 80 to 1,000 acres—the necessary reserves being made public for railways, highways, watering stock, &c. This land is thrown open for selection in large quantities—from 50,000 to 200,000 acres being put up at one time. At present there is as much as 2,280,000 acres of land surveyed and open for immediate selection.

Agriculture.

About two-thirds of the total area of land cultivated is cropped with wheat, of which cereal 1,768,781 acres were reaped last year. The area of wheat grown has increased more than 100 per cent. during the last 10 years.

Vine culture is an important and progressive industry. There are 4,202 acres of land devoted to this purpose. The produce of these vineyards for the year ended December, 1881, was 313,060 gallons of wine—about 130 gallons per acre. The suitability of the soil and climate of South Australia to the growth of wine was soon discovered by the earlier settlers, some of whom had brought from Europe a variety of high-class vine cuttings. The slopes of the hills produce wines of a full-bodied character similar to those of Spain and Portugal, whilst those made in the more elevated districts resemble the lighter wines to the Rhine. Whilst the local demand is fully supplied at very cheap rates, a considerable export trade in wines of a higher character is carried on. The wines of South Australia have always been awarded prizes at the several Great International Exhibitions.

The introduction of flax-growing into the ordinary routine of farm operations has been followed by considerable success, and the prices realized for this commodity in the European markets have been very encouraging.

Considerable attention has also been paid to the drying of raisins and currants. This branch of industry will probably soon develop into an export trade.

Almond trees are of rapid growth, and large quantities of a superior description of soft-shell almond are gathered yearly for home consumption and for shipment.

South Australia possesses all the conditions requisite for the successful and profitable culture of the olive. Olive oil of the most delicate character has been expressed, and gained awards at the various Exhibitions. Its purity and general superiority over the imported article of commerce has acquired for it a high position in the local market. The produce of the plantations is eagerly
purchased by persons who have entered upon the business of the manufacture of oil.

Pastoral Occupation.

In 1851 the total area of land leased from the Crown for pastoral purposes was 15,000 square miles. At the present time there are no less than 187,260 square miles in pastoral occupation. During the same period the number of horses has increased from 6,500 to 159,678; of horned cattle from 75,000 to 314,918; and of sheep from 1,000,000 to over 6,810,856, whilst the exports of wool have increased from 4,000 to 189,075 bales.

Manufactures.

A few years ago, flour mills and tanneries were almost the only representatives of local manufactures; whilst these have largely increased in number and efficiency, many important additions have been made to the list, viz., 82 steam flour mills with 1,750 horse-power, driving 299 pairs of stones; 1 boiling-down works; 23 tanneries and fellmongeries; several large wool-washing works; 8 soap and candle factories; 1 bone-dust mill; 1 glue and size works; 39 steam saw-mills; 21 foundries; 74 agricultural implement works (chiefly for reaping and winnowing machines); 44 coach and waggon-builders' shops; 1 woollen tweed factory; 83 clothing factories; 4 hat factories; 35 boot and shoe factories; 2 dye works; 1 flax mills; 1 rope walk; 5 brush manufactories; 25 breweries; 27 soda-water and cordial factories; 9 wine-making establishments; 7 biscuit bakeries; 7 jam and preserves; 7 confectionery manufactories; 5 dried fruits and 2 olive oil factories, and 2 ice-works. In addition to 5 patent slips, there are 7 ship and 7 boat-building yards. Several marble and 16 slate quarries of excellent quality, and over 100 building stone quarries have been opened.

The gasworks of the Colony are five in number, of which one is for the supply of the City of Adelaide and suburbs, one is at Port Adelaide, and the remaining three are in the principal country towns.

Import and Export Trade.

The combined import and export trade of 1881 amounted to 9,631,820L sterling, of which 5,224,068L were imports, and 4,407,757L exports.

Of the total imports, more than one-half, viz., 2,819,440L, came from the United Kingdom. Of the total exports, products representing 2,588,720L were exported to the mother country.

It appears that out of 3,643,402L worth of staple produce exported, the value of breadstuffs amounted to 1,336,761L; that wool represented 1,606,806L, and copper 418,296L.

South Australian wheat and flour command the highest price in the markets of the world, and secured the highest awards at the Paris Exhibition. The great bulk of the crop is shipped to the United Kingdom.

The total value of wool shipped in 1856 was 412,163L; 1866, 990,168L; and in 1881 it reached 1,606,806L sterling.

Roads.

There are 8,629 miles of road defined in the settled districts. The greater portion of the cost of which has been defrayed from the General Revenue—no special toll or rate having been levied. The aggregate number of miles macadamised is 1,606. In addition to the main lines, perhaps as many more miles of district or by-roads have been constructed and kept in repair by local municipalities out of rates and grants in aid.

Lighthouses.

The coast of South Australia is well lighted, first-class lighthouses having been erected on Capes Borda and Willoughby, Kangaroo Island, on Althorpe and Troubridge Islands, and at the entrance to Port Adelaide, in St. Vincent's Gulf; on Tipara Shoal, in Spencer Gulf; and on Capes Jervis, Jaffa, and Northumberland. There are also other smaller lighthouses. The total cost of maintenance of lighthouses in 1881 was 7,444L, and the amount of light dues received 8,411L.*

Railways.

The mileage of railways opened for traffic in the Colony is 832 and the mileage of new lines in course of construction is 161. Up to December 31st, 1881, the total receipts from railways reached 3,870,446L, and the expenditure to 3,119,239L, showing a balance of 751,207L. The amount defrayed in the construction of railways to that date was 5,810,110L.

Telegraphs.

The geographical position of South Australia being practically that of the most western of the group, the first port of arrival and the last of departure for mail communication with Great Britain and the East, necessitated early and earnest attention being devoted to the extension of the South Australian telegraphs, so as to afford instantaneous communication with Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Port Darwin, and Perth. In order to accomplish direct telegraphic communication with Europe, from which such great results have flowed, and so immense an area of territory has been opened up, South Australia, at her own risk, erected a line of telegraph some 2,200 miles in length, at a cost of over 400,000L, across a continent which had only been traversed by an exploring party.

At the close of the year 1881 there were 165 stations, and 4,946 miles of line open throughout the Colony, and there are several lines now in course of construction.

There is now through communication with all the sister Colonies—Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, New Zealand, and Western Australia, thereby completing the chain which unites the whole of the British possessions at the antipodes with the mother country and the rest of the civilized world.

Climate and Meteorology.

The climate of South Australia is remarkable for its dryness, and owing to this cause, the heat, except on hot-wind days, is seldom oppressive. When a fierce hot wind is blowing, and the thermometer stands perhaps at something over 100°, the wet bulb thermometer will show 65°, and it is this peculiarity which enables persons to bear the heat of the South Australian summer, and carry on their usual pursuits with less inconvenience and discomfort than is felt in tropical and damp climates, when the temperature is 15° or 20° lower than in South Australia.

The hottest months in the year are December, January, and February, when the temperature on the plains frequently exceeds 100° in the shade.

* Rates reduced August, 1877.
November and March are also hot, but the nights, especially in the former month, are cooler, and the heat is seldom of long duration, rarely reaching 100° in the shade, and coming in suddenly with a strong hot wind, is followed quickly by a change to cool or even cold weather. A few hot days occasionally occur in October, but even in the hottest months, especially in December, the weather is often broken by cloudy, cold intervals, with strong south-west winds, veering gradually to south and south-east. This state of things will continue for several days, during which the wind from the south-east will usually freshen towards sunset, a bank of cloud forming over the Mount Lofty Ranges with cold nights, the temperature falling rapidly after sunset.

After March, the temperature falls rapidly, very rarely reaching 90° in the shade in April (only six times in five years), the mean temperature for that month, deduced from ten years' observations, being 64·6, or 5·5 below that of the preceding month, whilst for May it is only 58·2. The coldest months are June, July, and August, the mean monthly temperature of which are 54·4, 51·5, and 58·7 respectively.

The climate, with few exceptions, is all that Europeans could desire; it is a climate of blue skies, bright sunshine, and mild genial weather, varied by sufficient rainfall and moisture in most years, and marked by an almost entire absence of those fierce commotions which elsewhere bring distraction and dismay. Hurricanes may be said to be unknown, fogs are rare, earthquakes, which have been occasionally noted, are confined to a few slight tremors and rumblings. Everything is favourable to health and peaceful industry.

**STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.**

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict. c. 115.

**Situation and Area.**

Singapore is an island about 27 miles long by 14 wide, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 16' north, and long. 108° 53' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of newly acquired territory to the south of the Kran (vide infra).

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 120 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 24 miles in breadth. The principal town, called Malacca, is 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

**History.**

Malacca is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally fell into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should not again meddle with affairs or have any settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined, and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of no commercial importance, but possessing great undeveloped agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not reduced to mercantile subjection by the Dutch; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn declined in importance, as the greater part of the extensive Eastern trade centred at Singapore, and Penang came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Kallang, Selangor, Junk Ceylon, the Settlement of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra, &c.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 10,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1793, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Provinco Wellesley. It extends from the Muda River to the Krian River, a distance of 35 miles, containing in all 284 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, when compared with the neighbouring territories, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and cocoa-nuts. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1832 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

Singapore was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Malayan princes. It was at first subordinate to Bencoolen in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlement.

The anarchy prevailing in some states of the
Malayan Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was for years a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders. In the beginning of 1874 steps were taken by Sir A. Clarke to remedy this state of things by stationing British residents in Perak and Selangor, and in the small state of Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration. With a view also of enabling the British Authorities to keep order in that part of the Peninsula, a strip of land south of Province Wellesley, about 10 miles broad, beyond the Krian river, has been acquired as British Territory, as well as a small portion of territory on the mainland, opposite the island of Palo Pangkor.

Towards the end of 1875 disturbances arose in the States in question, Mr. Birch, the British Resident at Perak, was murdered, a force sent to apprehend the murderers was resisted; and, at the same time the Residency in Sungei Ujong was menaced by bodies of Malays from some of the States near Malacca.

Under the prompt and energetic measures taken by the Governor, Sir W. Jervois, these outbreaks were suppressed in the course of about two months. Troops were obtained from India and China, a naval brigade was landed, and a native contingent organized. The forces in Perak under Major-General Colborne and Captain Buller, R.N., occupied that State; a military and naval force under the direction of Colonel Anson, Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, and commanded by Colonel Hill, of the 1st Ghoorkhas, and Captain Sterling, R.N., drove the enemy from a strong fortified position in Sungei Ujong, and dispersed the malcontents in that quarter. During these operations, Selangor remained tolerably quiet.

Since the military occupation of Perak, those concerned in the murder of Mr. Birch have been captured and punished, some of the chiefs being banished to the Seychelles. Peace and order now reign throughout the peninsula, and the government of the States has assumed a settled form. In Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, Residents have been appointed, who are assisted by a staff of European officers, and it is their duty to aid the native rulers by advice, and to carry out certain executive functions delegated to them. The supreme authority in Perak and Selangor is vested in the State Council, consisting in each State of the highest native authorities and the principal English officials. In Sungei Ujong, the chief executive authority is the Datoh Klana, who is not present assisted by a council. The Residents are directly under the Government of the Straits Settlements.

The duty on the export of tin forms the largest item of the revenue of these States. The country, however, is otherwise rich, and offers great advantages for the cultivation of coffee, cinchona, &c., on its high lands, and of paddy in the valleys. It is not possible to form any accurate estimate of the population; but it is known that since the war the increase among the Chinese has been very great.

The revenue and expenditure of the three States for the last three years are as follows:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1879 | £67,674 | £72,941     |
| 1880 | 116,499 | 104,399     |
| 1881 | 123,572 | 120,587     |

**Selangor**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1879 | £36,877 | £37,146     |
| 1880 | 43,123  | 40,561      |
| 1881 | 47,045  | 46,876      |

**Sungei Ujong**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1879 | £15,826 | £15,050     |
| 1880 | 18,759  | 15,428      |
| 1881 | 19,533  | 14,693      |

**Government**

The government of the Straits Settlements consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council; the latter body comprising 10 official members and 6 unofficial nominated members.

The Military Force consists of a battery of Royal Artillery and one Battalion of an Infantry Regiment, of which two Companies are stationed at Penang, and the remainder at Singapore.

**Population**

A census was taken in the Colony on the 3rd April, 1881. The following figures give the numbers in the several settlements:

- Singapore: 139,208
- Penang: 90,951
- Province Wellesley: 97,324
- Malacca: 93,579
- The Dindings: 2,823

Total: 423,884

The following are the chief statistics of the census:

| Year | Euro-peans | Malays | Natives of India |
|------|------------|-------|------------------|
| 1866 | 2,769      | 22,155| 86,786           |
| 1871 | 612        | 21,772| 45,135           |

The result of the census in previous years was as follows:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1866 | 278,000    |
| 1871 | 307,951    |

**Trade**

The Straits ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping entering the port is liable, consists of a very moderate one, of 3 cents* or ¼d. per ton register, in support of the Horsburgh and Raffles Lighthouses at the eastern and western entrances to the roads of Singapore, a light on the North Sands about the middle of the Straits of Malacca, one at Cape Rachado, and another at Pulo Undan, 10 miles from Malacca, besides a light ship on Formosa bank.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, India-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in our own territories are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); rice (in Prov. Wellesley and Malacca), and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). In the Province an attempt has recently been made with some success to cultivate the tea-plant.

* To be reduced to 2 cents per ton from 1st Jan., 1882.
The value of the united exports and imports of the three Settlements in 1859-60 was as follows:

| Settlement     | Value       |
|----------------|-------------|
| Singapore      | £10,371,800 |
| Penang         | 8,580,000   |
| Malacca        | 920,000     |

Total: £14,821,800

In 1881 it had increased to—

| Settlement     | Value       |
|----------------|-------------|
| Singapore      | £25,740,174 |
| Penang         | 7,800,315   |
| Malacca        | 1,516,742   |

Total: £34,557,121

Number and tonnage of vessels which have arrived at the Straits Settlements in the four last years were as follows:

| Year | No.   | Tonnage   |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 1878 | 12,478| 8,360,638 |
| 1879 | 11,879| 2,785,843 |
| 1880 | 11,661| 3,004,045 |
| 1881 | 11,077| 3,137,558 |

The number of larger vessels entering has considerably increased, and the falling off shown in these figures arises from the fact that fewer native craft enter.

Finance.

The sources from which the revenue is raised are alike in all the three stations. They consist chiefly of a stamp duty, the monopolies of preparing and retailing opium for smoking, and the sale of spirits and other excisable commodities, which are farmed out to private individuals. The land revenue comprises the proceeds of sales of public lands, quit rents, tenths, and fees on transfer. Judicial fines and fees, the post office, the light-dues and a few miscellaneous items, make up the remaining sources of revenue.

### TASMANIA

#### General Description

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass's Straits, 120 miles wide; the important gold-producing colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. The surface is diversified by ranges of hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains. Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

Taking the average of 35 years at Hobart, the mean heat of spring is 56°; summer, 62°; autumn, 55°; and winter, 47°; of the whole year, 55°, which—compared with that of London, 51°; Edinburgh, 47°; Quebec, 41°; New York, 51°—shows a superiority of climate over those places. Rain falls on an average 148 days in the year, and the rainfall is a little more than 24 inches.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 795 miles of telegraph (with 1,024 miles of wire) open in the colony.

There is an electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to New South Wales, Queensland, Adelaide, and South Australia, the starting point of a line across the Australian continent to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The colony is placed in telegraph communication with New Zealand, via Sydney (New South Wales), by means of submarine cable.

* The Dindings are placed temporarily under the Resident, Perak.
Steamers run between Melbourne and Hobart and Launceston twice and sometimes thrice a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every fortnight. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There is also a steamer trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. Sailing vessels are continually departing from Hobart or Launceston to all the Australian colonies and New Zealand. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Galle and London every two weeks, time 42 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 60 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Singapore, and Galle every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 70 days. Sailing vessels of 600 to 700 tons direct to London in summer months. Clipper ships of heavy tonnage, as well as steamers of large power and tonnage, run between London and Melbourne all the year round, affording great facilities for communication between England and Tasmania.

There are 212 places in Tasmania where post offices are established.

There is no postage on newspapers to the United Kingdom, the other Australian colonies, or any part of Tasmania, when posted in the island.

The post office money order system is in force for orders on the Australian colonies, New Zealand, Great Britain and Ireland, India, and Germany, up to 10l. for each order.

The island contains 15½ million acres of land, and the islands connected with it contain 13 million acres: 4,265,944 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown; leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of about 12,672,000 acres, of which 1,888,000 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The colony—which is 170 miles from N. to S., and 160 from E. to W.—is divided into 18 counties.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass's Straits.

Besides the corporations of the city of Hobart Town and town of Launceston, there are nineteen rural municipal councils in the colony, each with its warden and a sufficient police, and eleven police districts.

Benevolent societies, working men's clubs, homes for the poor, asylums for the insane, hospitals for the sick, three asylums for paupers, reformatories, boys' home, town mission, Bible societies, temperance societies, Odd Fellows' Societies, Free masons' lodges, gardeners' societies, and agricultural associations, have been established, and are in active operation.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government: all the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1881 the maintenance of main roads cost 12,444l., of cross and bye roads 33,843l.

A line of railway 133 miles in length to connect the two ports of Hobart and Launceston has been constructed by an English Company; the colony guaranteeing to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on a sum not exceeding 650,000l. for 30 years upon due fulfilment of the contract and maintenance of the line during that period.

There is also a railway from the port of Laun- ceston to Deloraine, 45 miles in length, passing through some of the best agricultural lands of the colony. It cost 510,000l., and it is about to be extended from Deloraine to Formby, on the north-west coast.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than 5s. an acre.

Any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at 1l. an acre, on the following terms, as exemplified to the extent of 100 acres:

| Acres | £  | s. | d. |
|-------|----|----|----|
| 100   |    |    |    |
| Add one-third for credit |    |    |    |

£183 6 8

| Cash at time of purchase |    |    |    |
| Ditto first year         |    |    |    |
| Ditto second year        |    |    |    |
| Ditto third and following years |    |    |    |

And so on in proportion for any greater or smaller area than 100 acres.

When 500 acres shall have been sold in not less than 10 lots adjoining or close to each other, the Governor in Council is empowered to raise a sum not exceeding half of such purchase money for the purpose of constructing a road or roads in the vicinity of the lots.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l.

The various islands belonging to Tasmania may be leased for 14 years by rent payable in advance for each year.

The Immigration Act also empowers the Immigration Board to permit any person, who has paid his family's passage-money as a "cabin" or intermediate passenger, to demand, within a year after his arrival in the colony, a certificate to select 30 acres of land for himself, 20 for his wife, and 10 for each child accompanying him or joining him, within twelve months.

And for these lands a grant will issue after five years' residence within the colony; but the order will not be forfeited by the death of the emigrant if his family remain.

The Emigration and Colonists' Aid Corporation, 25, Queen Anne's Gate, Westminster, London, is the agency now employed by the Tasmanian Board of Immigration, to whom all enquiries for information respecting the Colony should be addressed.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of tin and gold exported in 1881 was—tin, 875,775l.; gold, 211,253l.

The land in cultivation in 1881 was 874,874 acres. There were in the colony 180,826 horned cattle and 1,847,479 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1881 was 8,269,724 lb., valued at 498,400l.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, some of which are now being turned to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, and iron of the finest quality has been produced from them. Tin in
immense quantities has been discovered at Mount Bischoff, the whole mountain being said to be intersected with veins of that ore. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper, silver, and antimony have also been found, the copper yielding 30 per cent. of metal. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

In the elevated plateau which occupies the centre of the island, are numerous lakes, which by means of irrigation might be made to spread fertility over a large surface, and furnish rich pasture land for stock.

In these various ways profitable employment might be found for a large amount of capital and labour, and Tasmania might become one of the most prosperous and agreeable of the Australasian colonies.

The want of labour is seriously felt, in consequence of the drain upon it by the mines. Farm and other labourers, and female domestic servants, are in great request, as well as miners and artizans.

Census.

On 3rd April, 1881, the population of Tasmania was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females. The death-rate of 1881 was 14.77 to the 1,000 of the population, but for 1868-78 it was only 14 per 1,000. The number of inhabited houses is 21,853. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds, many of whom are descended from them.

Numerous churches and chapels are erected in various parts; and in addition to private schools, there are 175 Government schools, having 13,644 scholars on the rolls; and several scholarships are maintained by the colony, the best being the two annual Tasmanian scholarships, tenable at an English university for four years, of 200L a year each. There are also 14 yearly exhibitions from primary to superior schools, each tenable for four years, varying from 16L. to 20L. a year.

There were 31,080 persons in Tasmania who could not read, according to the census, on 3rd of April, 1881, of whom 15,889 were under 5 years old.

Hobart is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1881) 21,118 inhabitants, and 38 places of worship. The city has been much improved of late years by the addition of several handsome public buildings.

Launceston, the second town of the colony, contains a population of 12,752 persons, and is rapidly progressing.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17); by this Act a Legislative Council and House of Assembly are constituted, called "the Parliament of Tasmania."

The Legislative Council consists of sixteen members, elected for thirteen electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 50L. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-two members, elected for the same number of electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly is five years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is property of the value of 50L. in the district for which he votes, or household property of the annual value of 7L.; or being a barrister or solicitor on the roll of the Supreme Court, or legally qualified medical practitioner or minister of religion, &c., resident for twelve months before in the district. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict., No. 32.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.
