MALTA.

Malta is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valletta, its port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is about 95 square miles; that of Gozo 20 square miles.

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1400. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese islands fell alternately to the lot of the Carthaginians and Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of Paul took place (Acts xxviii). On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell to the Goths, and then to the Saracens, who were expelled by Count Roger the Norman. It was under the dominion of the House of Aragon from 1190 until early in the sixteenth century, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V. to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, Malta capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte. The Maltese rose, however, against their conquerors, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they closely blockaded them for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and Malta was taken possession of by Great Britain 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris 1814.

The climate of Malta is somewhat peculiar. In summer, during the daytime, the heat almost equals
that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is $61^\circ$ Fahr., and the minimum $53^\circ$; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is $82^\circ$ Fahr., and the minimum $73^\circ$.

The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton, potatoes, and corn; the vine is grown; oranges and figs are abundant; honey of a superior kind is also produced; and early crops of potatoes are exported to England.

During the year 1874, the great work begun by the late Sir Gaspard Le Marchant, namely, the extension of Malta Great Harbour, was finally completed, and the French Creek handed over to the Admiralty authorities, whilst the merchant shipping was moved into the newly-extended waters of Marsa. Another important work—the re-modelling of the drainage of the fortified towns—is now in progress, and it is hoped that on its completion, and by the carrying out of other hygienic measures, the reputation of Malta as a healthy sojourn and pleasant winter resort will be greatly enhanced.

Malta is connected with the undermentioned ports as follows:

- Gibraltar and England by the P. & O. steamers, once a week.
- Sicily and Italy by Florio's steamers, three times a week, and by the Transatlantique steamers once a week.
- Marseilles and Naples by the French steamers, three times a month (say 5th, 25th, and 29th of each month).
- Port Said by the P. & O. steamers, once a week.
- Alexandria by the French steamers, twice a month (say 5th and 25th of each month).
- Cyprus by the P. & O. steamers, once a week, via Alexandria.
- Tunis and Marseilles by Messrs. Rubattino's steamers, once a week.
- Tunis by Mr. Gollcher's steamer "Lancefield," once a week; Tunis by the Transatlantique steamers once a week.
- Tripoli by the Maltese steamer "Allegra," say once a week, by Messrs. Rubattino's steamers once a week, and by the Transatlantique steamers also once a week.

The Government is administered by a Governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, constituted by Letters Patent dated 24th May, 1881, consisting of three members, and by a Council of Government, constituted by Letters Patent of 11th May, 1849, consisting of 18 members, 10 official, and 8 elected, who have hitherto been returned by about 2,700 electors, an income of £1 from immovable property, or payment of a rent of 4l. per annum, and a knowledge of English or Italian, qualifying a person to vote. Letters patent are in preparation extending the franchise to all persons having an income from immovable property of £1, or paying a rent of £1 per annum. The Council, unless sooner dissolved, lasts five years. The Governor presides at meetings of Council.

The most important sources of revenue in Malta are the Customs duties, chiefly levied on grain. The tax on wheat is 10s. a quarter.
