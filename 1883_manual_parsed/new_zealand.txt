NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and the South or Stewart's Island. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Colony; the chief of these are the Chatham Isles and the Auckland Isles. The entire group lies between 38° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 178° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles; the average being about 140 miles.

The total area of New Zealand is about 104,000 or 66,560,000 acres.
Viz., North Island . . . 45,687 or 29,240,000
Middle Island . . . 57,313 or 36,680,000
Stewart's Island . . . 1,000 or 640,000

It will thus be seen that the total area of New Zealand is somewhat less than that of Great Britain and Ireland.

Climate.

From its healthy and salubrious climate, from its great extent of coast line, and from its position with regard to the neighbouring continent of Australia, New Zealand is often called "the Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere." The temperature is, however, much more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington, nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin, nearly the same as at London. The official reports of the Medical Department show that whereas the annual mortality from all diseases out of every 1,000 British soldiers quartered in the United Kingdom was 16, it was only 5 out of every 1,000 in the troops quartered for more than twenty-five years in New Zealand.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was first visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies. In 1840, the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, and the islands were erected into a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from
Hawalki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them have fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity appears to have been established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. It was estimated, on 1st March, 1878, that the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 42,819, all of whom dwell in the North Island, with the exception of 2,282 scattered over the other islands.

**Constitution.**

A constitutional form of Government was established in New Zealand by the Imperial Statute 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 72, passed in 1852. By that Act, the Colony was divided into six provinces, since increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounts to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vic., No. XXI., passed in 1875, the provincial system of Government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The Act provided that the abolition of the provinces should not have any operation until the day after the conclusion of the then next session of the Assembly, excepting that in the meantime Provincial Councils should not hold any meeting. Before the next Session there was a general election, and the first Session of the new Parliament ended on the 31st of October, 1876. Nothing was done during the Session to repeal the Abolition Act, and the provinces, therefore, ceased to exist the day after the Session concluded. The provincial system being abolished provision was made for the division of the country into counties, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, and consists of the Governor, of a Legislative Council, and of a House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and hold their seats for life. The Members of the House of Representatives are chosen by Electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector is qualified to become a Member. The House of Representatives now consists of 95, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native Government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1864, the seat of the general Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

**Statistics.**

The population of New Zealand on the 30th June, 1882, was estimated at 508,000, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 44,099 at the census taken in 1881.

The revenue, the trade, and the other elements of material prosperity have increased largely during recent years. Thus the revenue was in 1861, £691,646.; and in 1881-2, the total ordinary and territorial revenue was as follows:—Ordinary revenue, £3,488,170.; territorial, £17,063.; total £3,605,233.

The population of the chief towns on the 3rd of April, 1881, was as follows:—Wellington (the seat of the general Government), 20,563; Dunedin, 24,372; Auckland, 16,664; Christchurch, 15,218; Nelson, 6,764. All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold exported from the colony up to 31st December, 1880, was valued at £37,380,638.; and the annual production is now about 1½ millions sterling. The wool exported in 1880 amounted to 66,860,150 lbs., valued at £3,169,800. In 1885 it amounted to 1,772,844 lbs., valued at £93,1047. The live stock in New Zealand in 1882 was:—Horses, 162,000 for 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 700,000; sheep, 12,985,085 for 11,704,858 in 1874. The number of acres under cultivation in February, 1881, was 1,211,166 acres, exclusive of land laid down to grasses.

The system of Government Life Insurance has worked remarkably well. The last quinquennial examination was made in 1881, by eminent actuaries resident in England, and their report was highly satisfactory, showing that a large amount was available as a bonus to the insurers.

**Public Works Policy.**

In 1870, the Immigration and Public Works Act and cognate Acts were passed, and the policy contained in them may be shortly described as follows:—

The colony was to incur a liability, spread over a course of years, amounting to about ten millions, which were to be expended in specified proportions on the under-mentioned objects:—

1. Immigration.
2. Main railways throughout each island.
3. Roads through the interior of the North Island.
4. The purchase of native land in the North Island.
5. The supply of water on gold-fields.
6. The extension of telegraph works.
7. Miscellaneous public works.

The administration of these services was vested in the General Government, and the responsibility, subject to some exceptions in which its action depended on the previous concurrence of provincial authorities, devolved on the General Government. These exceptions have been abolished by subsequent legislation.

For the better working of these Acts, two departments have been organized, called the Immigration Department and the Public Works Department.

Since 1870, and up to the 31st of December, 1881, the Agent-General for New Zealand has despatched to the colony 101,984 souls.

Since its organization, the Public Works Department has constructed in the North and South Islands dray and horse roads to the extent of upwards of 2,000 miles, at a cost of £1,261,224l. 0s. 2d.
including several hundred bridges, opening up nearly all parts of the North Island for settlement.

It may here be remarked, that before the creation of the Public Works Department of the General Government, many thousands of miles of good and substantial roads had been constructed by the various Provincial Governments throughout the colony.

The construction of railways is still being proceeded with. On the 31st March, 1882, there were open for traffic throughout the Colony 1,393 miles. There was a balance of profit on their working during the twelve months ending the 31st March, 1882, of £369,000; while the total expenditure on construction of the railways open for traffic to the same date had been £944,300, thus showing a profit of £7,185, 2d. per cent. on the whole outlay. In addition to this, Parliament has sanctioned a further length of 1,191 miles, for which surveys and plans are being prepared, with a view to the execution of the works as funds will permit. The whole of the above railways are to cost, when completed, with their equipments, about £16,250,000.

The railway system of the colony is indicated in the accompanying map of the islands.
