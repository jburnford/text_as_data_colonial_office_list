BRITISH GUIANA.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 200 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice. It is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyn, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and northeast by the Atlantic Ocean.
This territory was first partially settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1580. It was from time to time held by Holland, France, and England. It was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, to whom it was finally ceded in 1814.

It is impossible to specify the exact area of the Colony, as its precise boundaries between Venezuela and Brazil respectively are undetermined, but it has been computed to be 76,000 square miles.

**Constitution.**

Under the Dutch, Demerara and Essequebo constituted one Government, and Berbice another, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1792; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six; any vacancy occurring being filled by the Governor's selection of one out of two nominations submitted by the remaining councillors. In the year 1817, however, an order was made by the Prince Regent in Council, requiring three nominations to be made in lieu of two for the Governor's selection, and also declaring that if no such nomination were made in fourteen days, the Governor should be entitled to appoint absolutely to the vacancy. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Demerara appears to have been established in 1773. In 1789 that for Essequebo was merged into it, and the seat of Government for the United provinces was established at Stabroek, the site of the present capital Georgetown. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government, and the West India Company, as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution), was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government, established a new one for the joined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation, notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and in 1802, and its cession in 1808; the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before. It is, therefore, advisable now to advert to the leading provisions of that document.

The Council or Court of Policy was to consist of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

The unofficial Members were to be chosen "from among the principal, most capable, and most religious inhabitants, above twenty-five years of age, professing the Protestant religion, and perfectly acquainted with the Dutch language, and who had resided at least three years within the Colony."

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each Colony,* each consisting of seven Members, elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned, or ceased to be an inhabitant. The Kiezers, before proceeding to a nomination, were to be sworn to the faithful discharge of their office before the Director-General, a ceremony which continued to be observed until the passing of Ordinance No. 16 of 1864.

A periodical change in the constitution of the Council or Court of Policy was secured by providing that the Senior Colonial Member should retire yearly.

The Director-General was allowed a double vote, and the Secretary of Demerara was the "Minister of the Court of Policy."

Such seems to have been the original Legislative Constitution of the Colony. We now come to the occasion on which what are termed "Financial Representatives" were added.

It appears that in 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds.* In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon thought fit to annul this arrangement, and to enact that to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation, in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proceeding remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when Sir Benjamin D'Urban became Governor of the United Colony, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.†

The right of the Financial Representatives to exercise this power has been, however, strongly maintained by the Colonial Members upon all occasions, and this has led to collisions between the Executive and Elective section of the Court.§ The position they assume is based upon the construction of certain passages in a decree of

† During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848–9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.

§ Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial Representative, 1832.
the States-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves;" and in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1798, "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists, for example the 'Kiezers of both rivers,' and also upon the nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806. On the other hand, it has been contended that these minutes do not bear out the claim of right which has been founded upon them, since the evidence throughout seems to proceed upon the assumption that due provision has been previously made for the Sovereign's Chest, which is represented by the modern Civil List.

The foregoing is a succinct sketch of the Legislative Constitution as it existed up to the year 1849, when Ordinance, No. 15, for regulating the elective franchise, and dividing the Colony into Electoral districts, was passed.

The principle of the whole system of Government is centralization. Until the year 1826, there existed not even local subdivisions of the Colony. Demerara and Essequebo were then divided into ten Parishes, and the same process was subsequently applied to Berbice. This arrangement, however, was simply ecclesiastical, involving no civil authority or jurisdiction.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated, but the principle has not been materially extended in its application, although some advance has been made.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty. Since that time no legislation has been attempted in the same direction except the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution may be summed up very briefly. It consists of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly are performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which are dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passes all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which is passed by the Combined Court.

The Court of Policy is composed of five official and five elective members. The official members are the Governor, the Attorney-General, the Government Secretary, the Auditor-General, and the Immigration Agent-General. The elective members are chosen as follows:-When a vacancy occurs the College of Electors meets and submits to the Court of Policy the names of two persons, from whom one is selected by the Court.

The Colony is divided into five Electoral Divisions, each of which has its representative in the College of Electors, who is chosen for life or during permanent residence in the Colony, and one or more Financial Representatives, elected for two years, and eligible for re-election.

| Electoral Division | Registered Representatives | Electors |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| County of Demerara | 2 College of Electors     | 1 Financial 98 |
| City of Georgetown | 1                           | 250       |
| County of Essequebo | 2                           | 254       |
| County of Berbice  | 1                           | 42        |
| Town of New Amsterdam | 1                         | 76        |

In the Colony of British Guiana the Roman Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now based on that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is no Grand Jury.

Industry and Productions.

The staple products of British Guiana were in former years sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and coffee, but the cultivation of the two last-named articles has for many years past been almost entirely abandoned. The soil of some parts of the Colony is however still capable of producing coffee of rare excellence. The Berbice River coffee was once much prized; but these two industries have now given place to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, which at present is the chief industry of the Colony, and furnishes nearly ninety-two per cent. in value of its exports.

The forests of British Guiana abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of articles of household furniture.

There were 109 sugar estates in active operation in British Guiana in the year 1882, having an aggregate of sugar cane cultivation of 79,268 acres, and of plantain cultivation of 2,396 acres. The sugar crop for 1882 will yield upwards of 140,000 hogsheads; out of this quantity about 12,000 hogsheads are Muscovado sugar; the bulk of the production is the high class sugar known as Demerara crystals.

Further attention is being given to the planting of coffee and cocoa on the vegetable soils to the rear of the cane grove; and several abandoned coffee estates are being reclaimed. The great extension of sugar cultivation is due to the enlarged labour supply; and labour alone is wanted to extend this cultivation almost without limit. The average amount of money thrown into circulation as weekly wages has been estimated at $100,000; but such has been the demand for labour to reap the increased sugar crop of 1882, that the aggregate weekly wages have reached $135,000.

Climate.

The climate of British Guiana is hot, but not unhealthy. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 82° Far. The heat is greatly tempered by the cooling breezes from the sea, which prevail during the greater portion of the year. The heat is felt more in August and September than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes.

Capital.

The capital city of British Guiana is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 24" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing a population of upwards of fifty thousand souls.
Mail Communications.

The regular periodical mail communication with the Colony is maintained by the vessels of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which leave Southampton on the 2nd and 17th of every month. There are other lines of steamers trading to the Colony which carry mails, but their periods of departure are uncertain.
