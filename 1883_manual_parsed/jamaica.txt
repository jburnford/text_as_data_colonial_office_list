JAMAICA.

An island situated in the Caribbean Sea, and to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 40' and 18° 30', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 30'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 140 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,200 square miles, of which 897 were returned in 1829 as being under cultivation, and 2,100 in wood and "ruinate."

Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. After the capture of the island, until the Restoration of Charles II, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction. In 1660 the first establishment of a regular civil government was made by Charles II, who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. In 1807 the Slave Trade was abolished, at which time there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1838, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners; being rather more than 19l. a head on a slave population of 309,838.

Climate.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is about 80°, rising to 90° in the day time, and falling to 70° at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, and as there is a lofty range of mountains which run down the middle of the whole island, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

In the country the difference of temperature between day and night is seldom more than 10°, and the difference of temperature in summer and winter is much less, say 5° or 6°.

During this century Jamaica was tolerably free from hurricanes and earthquakes, until the 18th of August, 1880, when the effects of a cyclone were felt in the north and north-eastern portions of the island.

The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers. The annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 80 inches to as much as 180 inches.

Constitution.

The Constitution, which, after existing for nearly 200 years in Jamaica, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The abolition of
this form of government, and the substitution for it of a new form, resulted from the serious disturbances amongst the black population which occurred in October, 1865.

After the suppression of disaffection in St. Thomas's-in-the-East, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created.

The Legislature unanimously responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

An Act of the Imperial Parliament and an Order in Council of the 9th April, 1866, were passed providing a new Constitution for Jamaica, which is now in force, and is as follows:

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881. The Governor may appoint one or more persons to act provisionally as unofficial Councillor or Councillors, when the number appointed by her Majesty shall be less than six; and all the Councillors are to hold office during the Royal will and pleasure. The Governor sits as President. The official members, by virtue of their offices, are the senior military officer, the Colonial Secretary and the Attorney-General.

There is also a Privy Council, consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor, the senior military officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of Her Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum. The Governor is to consult in all cases with the Councillors, excepting only when the matter to be decided would in his judgment sustain material prejudice by consultation, or be too unimportant to require their advice: and he is to propose all questions on which they are to advise and decide; but any member may apply in writing for permission to propose a question, and a written answer, granting or refusing the request, is to be returned. The Governor is authorized to act in opposition to the advice and decision of the Privy Council, "if in any case it shall appear right so to do," and to report to the Secretary of State for the Colonies "the grounds and reasons" of his opposition, and any member may record on the minutes the nature of the advice or opinion offered and rejected.

In the Legislative Council, any member may propose questions for debate, excepting only that no law shall be enacted, nor any vote or resolution passed, nor any question admitted to debate, when the object is to dispose of or charge any part of the revenue, unless the proposition be made by the Governor, or the proposal expressly allowed or directed by him. All laws passed are to be styled, "Laws enacted by the Governor and Legislative Council of the Island of Jamaica."

Jamaica under Crown Government.

For many years prior to the establishment of Crown Government, in 1866, the expenditure of the island exceeded the revenue by large amounts; but a better collection of the imposts, and the increase of the community in numbers and substance, has permitted a large increase of revenue, and a considerable reduction of debt. The total revenues of Jamaica amount to about 20s. a head of the population, but this calculation includes local rates, railway telegraph and postal receipts, and reimbursements. The customs tariff and the excise produce respectively 6s. 6d. and 2s. 4d. a head of the population. The taxes on land are almost nominal, yielding only about 12,000l.

The number of parishes (which are the units of local government) has been reduced from 22 to 14. Each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., hospitals, almshouses, &c., &c., managed by the Municipal Board of the parish, of which the custos is usually appointed the chairman. The members of the Board are nominated by the chairman, and with the chairman are annually appointed by the governor. There is also a Road Board in each parish, for the management of the parochial roads, appointed in the same way as the Municipal Board. The several taxes received on houses, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected. The revenue is collected by the officers of the Revenue Department, with a collector in each parish at the head of a branch office. The principal sums are derived from import duties, which yield about 255,000l.; excise duty on rum, at 5s. per gallon, yielding 92,000l.; stamps, 15,500l.; licensees, 17,000l.; and postal revenue, 14,500l. The new railway receipts of 26,000l. and reimbursements 28,500l., swell the total of revenue.

There is a regular postal service three times a-week to and from all parts of the island, and daily to some limited parts, by which letters are carried at 2d. per oz.

Government savings banks were established in 1871, in all the principal towns, and there is now deposited about 330,000l., on which the rate of interest has, from 1st April, 1881, been reduced from 4 to 3 per cent., with the result of a very inconsiderable withdrawal of deposits. The deposits, with the exception of a working balance, are invested in home and colonial securities, and the Institution is thus self-supporting.

District courts, somewhat on the model of County Courts in England, are held all over the island. The judges are barristers or advocates.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are 21 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 698 sub-officers and men, distributed throughout the island.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons. For attending East Indian immigrants, vaccination, &c., &c., they are paid extra. They are not restricted in private practice, and at the same time are allowed the privileges of pension after twenty years' service, and six months' leave of absence on half-pay after six years' service.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail
contract steamers leave Southampton on the 2nd and 17th of each month. The average passage is 17 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. A French steamer leaves St. Nazaire once a month. Steamers of the Atlas line leave New York under contract every alternate Friday, and Kingston every third Tuesday and Friday. An additional steamer leaves the north side once a month for New York. The contract passage is six and a half days, and there are railways in addition to the contract ones.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the cables from Cuba touch at, whence it branches away via St. Thomas, Barbados, &c., to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 34 stations, is now completed.

At present the only railway in Jamaica is that from Kingston via Spanish Town to Old Harbour, a distance of 26 miles; but, since the purchase of the line by the Government, extensions to Porus (24 miles) and Ewarton (17 miles) have been commenced.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.

The rate of interest on the colony's debentures, which had been 6 per cent., was for some years subsequently reduced to 5 per cent., until the Railway Purchase and Railway Extension Loans were recently raised at 4½ and 4 per cent. respectively.
