THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

The Leeward Islands, comprising the Colonies of Antigua, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The text of the Act, which is given below, will explain the constitution and powers of the Federal Government and the relations between that Government and the several Island Governments. Sir Benjamin Pine, to whose energy and ability the passage of the measure in the islands is largely due, was honoured by Her Majesty after the passing of the Imperial Act with the dignity of a Knight Commander of the order of St. Michael and St. George; Messrs. Wigley and Freeling, the administrators of St. Kitts and Dominica, being on the same occasion made Companions of the Order, and Sir Oliver Nugent, President of the Legislative Council of Antigua, receiving the honour of Knighthood.

It may be mentioned, as of historical interest, that the Leeward Islands possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several Islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 and 4, Will. IV, c. 74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed, a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1832 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871 is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands.

Subjoined is the text of the Act.

CHAP. 107.

An Act for the Federation and general Government of the Leeward Islands (amended by local Act No. 11 of 1878). [21st August, 1871.]

Whereas the several legislative bodies of Her Majesty's Leeward Islands have, by certain resolutions, signified their desire for the union of the said Islands under one Government in manner therein set forth, and have requested that the said resolutions may be embodied in an Act of the Imperial Parliament with all such provisions as may necessary to give them full force and effect, and it is expedient that the said union should be established:

Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same as follows:—

1. This Act may be cited for all purposes as "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871."

2. So soon as this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands, those islands shall form one colony, consisting of six presidencies, namely, the several islands of Antigua, Montserrat, Saint Christopher, Nevis, and Dominica, with their respective dependencies, and the Virgin Islands.

3. In this Act the following terms shall have the meanings hereby assigned to them, unless there be something in the subject or context repugnant thereto (that is to say):—

"Governor" shall mean the Governor or officer for the time being administering the general government of the Leeward Islands

"General Government" and "General Legislature" shall respectively mean the Government and Legislature of the Leeward Islands;

"Island Government," "Island Council," and "Island Legislature," shall mean respectively the Government, Legislative body, or Legis-
ature of one of the above-named Presidencies:

"Proclamation" shall mean a written or printed notice under the hand of the Governor, published by his order in each of the Presidencies which it may directly concern.

4. This Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands on a day to be declared by proclamation.

5. There shall be an Executive Council of the Leeward Islands, consisting of such persons or officers as the Queen may from time to time name or designate.

6. The Queen may from time to time appoint such officers of the general Government as Her Majesty may think fit, with such salaries as may be assigned to them by the General Legislature.

7. There shall be in the Leeward Islands a Legislative Body, to be styled "The General Legislative Council," composed of Nine elective and Nine non-elective members [thus re-enacted by Act 11 of 1878].

Provided that the proceedings of the Council shall not be invalid on account of any vacancies therein.

8. Of the elective members, Four shall be taken from the Island Council of Antigua, Two from the Legislative Assembly of Dominica, and three from among the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of St. Christopher. The members for Antigua and Dominica shall respectively be chosen by the elective members of the Island Council from which they are taken, and those for St. Christopher by the non-official members of the Executive Council of St. Christopher, in such manner as the said Island Council may, from time to time, by any standing rule determine, and within such period as may, from time to time, be prescribed by proclamation. [This section is printed as re-enacted by the Leeward Islands Act 11 of 1878.]

9. The non-elective members shall be appointed by the Queen in such manner and under such conditions as Her Majesty may think fit, and shall be as follows:—

A President, who at the time of his appointment shall be member of some Island Council:
The Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, and the Auditor-General.

Five unofficial members, of whom one shall be taken from the Island Councils of Dominica, St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, and the Virgin Islands respectively, and who shall ipso facto vacate their seats on ceasing to be members of such Councils.

18. Such other subjects in respect of each presidency as the Island Legislature thereof may declare to be within the competency of the General Legislature.

11. Subject to the provisions of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth sections of this Act, the Governor may, with the consent of the Legislative Body of any presidency, make laws for the peace, order, and good government thereof, but any island enactment relating to any of the subjects named in the preceding section may at any time be repealed or altered by the General Legislature, and shall, without any formal repeal, be void so far as it is repugnant to any law passed by the General Legislature.

12. The Council may from time to time be convoked, prorogued, and dissolved by any instrument under the hand and seal of the Governor.

13. The Council shall be so convoked within six months after this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands, and afterwards once (at least) in every year.

14. The place of meeting of the Council shall from time be fixed by proclamation.

15. The duration of the Council, unless sooner dissolved, shall be three years.

16. Every member of the Council shall, before taking his seat, take and subscribe before the Governor, or some person authorized by him, the following oath of allegiance:—

"I, A.B., do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria, her heirs and successors, according to law.

"So help me GOD."

But any person authorized by law to affirm or declare, instead of taking an oath may make such affirmation or declaration in lieu of the said oath.

17. The Council shall appoint one of the members of the Council to be vice-president thereof.

18. Every member of the Council, except the official members, may resign his seat therein by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor.

19. Every elective member who shall accept any office under the Crown shall vacate his seat in the said Council, but shall be eligible for re-election.

20. When any elective member vacates his seat in the Council otherwise than by the dissolution or other determination thereof, the elective members of the island council which he represented shall choose a successor within three months after notice of such vacancy shall have been proclaimed in the presidency; and if they fail to do so within that time the Governor shall appoint a person from that island council to fill such vacancy.

21. Until otherwise determined by the Council, the Council shall not be considered as constituted for the despatch of business unless at least nine members be present and assisting thereto.

22. Questions arising in the Council shall be decided by a majority of voices; the President shall, in all cases, have a vote, and when the voices are
equal the decision shall be deemed to be in the negative.

23. No vote or resolution shall be proposed in the Council having for its object to charge any part of the revenues arising within the said Leeward Islands, except by one of the official members, or with the express approval or direction of the Governor.

24. When a Bill passed by the Council is presented to the Governor for his assent, he shall declare according to his discretion either that he assents thereto, or that he refuses his assent to the same, or that he reserves the same for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure thereon.

25. When the Governor assents to a Bill, he shall by the first convenient opportunity send an authentic copy of the law to one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and it shall be lawful for Her Majesty at any time within eighteen months after such copy shall have been received by the said Secretary of State to notify to the Governor her disallowance of such law through one of her Principal Secretaries of State, and every such law shall become null and void from and after the day on which the said Governor shall signify such disallowance by message to the Council, or from and after a day to be named by proclamation.

26. A Bill reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure shall take effect so soon as Her Majesty shall have given her assent to the same by Order in Council, and the Governor shall have signified such assent by message to the Council or proclamation, provided that no such message or proclamation shall be issued after two years from the day on which the Bill was presented to the Governor for his assent.

27. The Council shall at its first meeting, and may from time to time afterwards, as occasion may require, adopt standing rules and orders for the orderly conduct of business, which rules and orders shall take effect when confirmed by the Governor.

28. The expenses of such establishments as are common to all the Leeward Islands, other than the remuneration and travelling expenses of the members of the Council, shall be fixed by the Council, and shall, until otherwise apportioned by the Council, be divided into sixteen parts, which shall be charged as follows:

- On Antigua . . . . . 5 parts.
- St. Christopher . . . 4 "
- Dominica . . . . . 3 "
- Nevis . . . . . 2 "
- Montserrat . . . . . 1 "
- Virgin Islands . . . . 1 "

Such charges, however, as may be incurred in respect of immigration shall be shared only by such islands as may elect to participate therein.

29. An estimate of such expenses shall be every year prepared by the General Government and laid before the Council, and when passed by the Council shall be published in the Leeward Islands; and after such publication the Governor may, from time to time, as the occasion may require, draw on the public treasury of each presidency for the whole or any part of the amount due from such presidency.

30. The Council may, by any law or laws, alter from time to time any of the provisions of this Act; Provided that every such law shall be reserved by the said Governor for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure.

31. The term Governor or officer administering the Government, when used in any island enactment heretofore passed, shall, after this Act shall come into operation, and until otherwise provided by the Island Legislature, be taken to mean the Governor of the Leeward Islands or any other person appointed in that behalf by writing under his hand and under the Public Seal of the Presidency.

32. The powers conferred on Her Majesty by the fifth, sixth, and ninth sections of this Act may be exercised by instructions or warrants under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet, or may be delegated to the Governor by letters patent under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom; and such instructions, warrants, or letters patent may be issued before this Act shall come into operation in the Leeward Islands.

33. It shall be lawful for Her Majesty, by Order in Council, from time to time, on address from the Legislative Body of any of the West Indian Islands not included in this Act and from the Council, to bring such island under the operation of this Act, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed, and as Her Majesty thinks fit to approve, and the provisions of any Order in Council in that behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Imperial Parliament.

ANTIGUA.

An island situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1632. In 1663, Charles II made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. Area of the island is 108 square miles. About £7,500 is annually spent in the support of Poor Houses, Hospitals, Board of Health, and for Medical Relief, Vaccination, &c. There are 14 places of worship belonging to the Church of England, 13 Moravian, 10 Wesleyan.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, and Treasurer, are ex-officio members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1852, and are as follows:

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of 111l., or one acre of land and building value 222l., or tenant paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 208 voters registered for the whole Island, 130 are registered for the City of St. John. The districts are as follows:

| District                        | Members |
|---------------------------------|---------|
| City of St. John                | 2       |

| Willoughby Bay                  | 1       |
| Division of Falmouth and Rendezvous Bay, and Towns Falmouth and English Harbour | 1 |

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council, who in the event of an equality of votes shall have a second or casting vote. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years. The elected members of the Legislative Council of Antigua send four elected members to the General Legislature.

This island, discovered by the celebrated Spanish navigator in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated in 16° 45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 12 miles in length, and 8 in the broadest part; its roads, however, are zigzag, uphill, and down ravine, so that a journey from the town of Plymouth (lying in the centre of the south-west coast) to north or south, exceeds the extreme length of the island.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants: it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782. M. Louis Joseph de Goullon, who was appointed Commandant, levied an impost of 1,800 Johannis, and demanded a furnished residence for himself, one for the Major, and others for the Treasurer, for the Commissary of Marine, for the Surgeon-Major, for warehouses of every kind, for a hospital, for a chapel for Divine service for the troops, and a residence near it for the chaplain, a residence for the keeper of the warehouses, and a chamber for his clerk. The House of Assembly provided the Governor with a furnished house, with horses, &c., &c., but offered a spirited resistance to the other demands.

The island was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668.

The island is justly considered the most healthy of the Antilles.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. Her Majesty may from time to time by any warrant under her sign manual and signet, or by any instructions through one of her principal Secretaries of State, designate such officers and appoint such persons, not exceeding six in all, as she may think fit, to be respectively official, or ex officio and unofficial members of the said Council, every councillor holding office during Her Majesty's pleasure.

The Governor, and in his absence any person appointed by him in writing, shall preside at every meeting of the Council, and shall have an original and casting vote.

The principal export of the island is sugar, which is shipped in tierces and barrels: 3 tierces equal 2 hogsheads. In a very good year the crop yields 2,500 hogsheads. Many sugar works are furnished with steam engines, but there are still some fine properties which rely on the windmill; there are a few cattle mills, and two or three mills are worked by water power. For some years past there has been established a valuable staple export, viz., lime juice, raw and concentrated. There are (principally in the northern part of the island) about 650 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is extending.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamized, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

ST. CHRISTOPHER.

(ST. Kitts.)

The following general description of St. Kitts is extracted from a Report on that Island, written by Lieutenant-Governor Sir Benjamin Pine, which was printed and laid before Parliament, March, 1862.

"The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

"The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The breadth of its main body is about five miles; that of the knob or peninsula is about two miles. The breadth of the neck varies from half a mile to a mile. The total area is 68 square miles.

"The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital.

"Immediately beyond these hills on the southeast is the narrowest part of the neck, which at this point is perfectly flat. But as it expands it rises into conical hills, which, covered with grass, prickly mimosa or aloes, traverse the knob or peninsula in almost every direction. In one spot, however, the hills recede from the sea, forming a basin, within which is a salt-pond about two miles in circumference.

"The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

"These tracts of land are covered with sugar plantations, and dotted over in every direction with homesteads, mills, and labourers' villages.

"The higher slopes of the mountains are clothed with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood."

The climate in St. Kitts, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. From observations made by Mr. Evelyn, the Receiver-General of the Colony, it appears that the average range of the thermometer was, in August in 1866, 8 a.m., 83½° and in February of the same year, 77½°, 87° at noon, 86° at 4 p.m.

The average range of the thermometer was, in February, 1873, 9 a.m., 78°, and at 2 p.m., 81°; and in August of the same year, 9 a.m., 84° and at 2 p.m., 86°.

The rainfall for the year 1872 was 45 ins.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly has now abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members are nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, has power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor is President, or, in his absence, such member as he may appoint in writing. Four besides the President are a quorum.

NEVIS.

This island is situate in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English in 1628. Its area is about 50 square miles. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form, its area about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea. The average height of the thermometer, 82°.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

Sugar is the chief product.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established, in which the Representative element was preserved, the majority of votes, however, resting with the nominees of the Crown. The Executive Council was reconstituted. The Elected Members of the Nevis Assembly sent one Member to the General Legislature of the Leeward Islands.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead, to consist of such officers and persons not exceeding six in number, as Her Majesty may by warrant or by any instruction through a Secretary of State designate or appoint to be official or ex-officio and unofficial members of the said Assembly. The Governor has power to appoint provisionally to vacancies amongst the unofficial members. Three is a quorum. The Governor is to preside, or, in his absence, such person as he may appoint in writing.

Leeward Islands Act 2 of 1882, entitled, "An Act for the Union of the Presidencies of Saint Christopher and Nevis," will come into operation on the 1st January, 1883, when the two Presidencies of Saint Christopher and Nevis, consisting of the Islands of Saint Christopher, Nevis, and Anguilla, with their respective dependencies, shall form one Presidency, to be called the Presidency of Saint Christopher and Nevis.

ANGUILLA.

The island of Anguilla is placed under the Presidency of St. Christopher, being governed locally by a stipendiary magistrate, paid from the Imperial Treasury. This officer is assisted by a Vestry, of which he is chairman. The Vestry is composed of the stipendiary magistrate, three elected members, and three nominated by the Crown.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at 556l., and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. But the island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,500, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock, which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, a duty on salt, a tax upon houses and lands, licences, &c.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of rocks; the largest island in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The Danes also possess some of them; the more important of which are St. Thomas, St. John, and Santa Croix; whilst the Spaniards lay claim to those near Porto Rico.

A civil government, and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

Constitution: In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government, who is to preside at the meetings of the Council, and to have a casting as well as a deliberation vote.

There is also an Executive Council.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and recently many of the landed proprietors have planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly, and appears likely to prove remunerative.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property. Sir Arthur Rumbold's account is as follows:

"The storm lasted from eleven a.m. to three p.m., but the greatest force was from twelve to two. In that brief space of time, two-thirds of the miserable tenements of the town were blown down. The gaol is destroyed, the church, the hospital, pier, school-house, Wesleyan Chapel, and Poor-house are also destroyed, and my own dwelling unroofed and rendered uninhabitable.

"The loss of life cannot as yet be correctly ascertained. I have, however, been officially informed of above twelve deaths in the town, two at Peter's Island, two at West End; while I hear that a quantity of people are killed in other parts of the country, and scarcely a hut or habitation is left standing.

"All was bright and verdant, the withering blast has passed over it, and not a fruit or other tree remains. The works of the few remaining estates are all totally destroyed."

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is an Island, situated in the centre of the Carribean Sea, between 15° 20' and 15° 45' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad; very mountainous and picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage.

This island was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Carribean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Cariba, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations. In 1756, Dominica became by conquest a dependency of England.

By the ninth article of the peace, signed at Paris between England and France in 1763, Dominica was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling the lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092l. 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising, besides Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart.

On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, fixing a qualification for candidates and electors for the House of Assembly, and regulating the proceedings at elections, which is still in force.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795, another invasion of the island was attempted under the direction of Victor Hughes, the French Republican Chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadaloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's making ready for battle, should they be attacked. Since this period the island has not known war.

The extent of the island is estimated at 186,436 acres. It abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish, and there is abundance of game in the island.

The Local Government is administered by a President, aided by an Executive Council of seven members. In 1865, during the temporary administration of Mr. (now Sir) W. C. F. Robinson, now Governor of South Australia, the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The president presides over the deliberations of this:

*Chiefly cattle.
body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committee.

The qualification for the representative of a parish is 50 acres of land, and for a representative of the town of Roseau or Portsmouth, 50 acres of land, or a messuage in the same town rented at 20l. per annum.

Electors for a parish must possess 10 acres in the parish, or house or building to be rented at 4l. per annum. For the towns of Roseau and Portsmouth, a house or building in the town worth 18l. per annum, or 8l. per annum for life out of and charged on lands or tenements.

The elected members of the Dominica Assembly send two members to the General Legislature of the Leeward Islands.
