THE DOMINION.

The constitution of the Dominion of Canada is regulated by the Imperial Act 30 Vic., c. 3, the leading provisions of which are set out under head III, of this article, together with an account of the Order in Council passed under it for the incorporation of the Province of British Columbia.

The Act was proclaimed on the 27th of May, 1867.

The Governor-General of Canada was by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act 33 Vic. cap. 3.

British Columbia was incorporated by Order in Council of the 16th of May, 1871, taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was incorporated by Order in Council bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieut.-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada, from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

Area.

The area of Canada is computed at 8,470,892 square miles. The greater part of this is comprised in the North West Territory. The seven settled Provinces of the Dominion comprise about 805,140 square miles.

Census.

The following are the latest returns relating to the population according to the census of 1881. The figures for 1871 are given for comparison.

The paid-up banking capital of Canada has doubled since 1870. In June of that year it was $29,801,013, and in September, 1881, it was $59,352,643-35. The banks had in September, 1881, a circulation of $81,753,589-69. They did $121,045,451-64 worth of discounting business, and they held $85,522,622-80 of deposits, of which $44,281,148-77 was payable after notice, and the balance at call; against which they held $16,189,249-8 in specie or Dominion notes.

Railways.

In 1881 the Dominion possessed of railways actually in operation, 7,260-51 miles; under construction, portions of which are completed, and track laid, 335 miles; under construction, 2,910 miles. Total 10,506 miles. This does not include 229 miles of railway in the United States, owned by two Canadian Companies. Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems.

Militia.

The Canadian Militia for some years past has been under the immediate command of a Lieut.-General of the English Army. The Dominion is divided, for military purposes, into twelve districts, with a Deputy Adjutant-General, and a Brigade Staff in charge of each. The reserve Militia numbers 658,000 men, and the active Militia 45,000 men, making up 700,000 in all.

There are included in this force 61 batteries of garrison artillery, and 16 of field artillery, and 40 troops of cavalry. There are two royal schools of gunnery, and the Dominion Government has lately established a school of scientific military instruction at Kingston, known as "The Royal Military College," presided over by Col. Hewett, R.E.

II. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

Canada is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497; but this is not certain. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.
In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days, and for a considerable time after, the French were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris.

From 1768 to 1774, Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were allowed the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic Clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same. The effect of this liberality was made manifest upon the occasion of the American Civil War, when the newly acquired, and then mainly Catholic province of Canada, remained loyal to England in spite of seductive overtures from the revolted Colonies.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), dividing Canada into two Provinces, upper Canada (now Ontario) and lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act of Parliament in question, the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1838. The most fruitful causes of dissension were the right of the Assembly to control public expenditure, and the question of the "Clergy Reserves," lands appropriated by the Imperial Act of 1791 for the exclusive benefit of the Anglican Clergy. The immediate exciting cause of the Rebellion was the establishing, by Governor Sir John Colborne, of 37 rectories in upper Canada. After the reduction of the insurgents, the constitution of lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by an Act, 3rd and 4th Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it has in fact exceeded double that number); the members were appointed for life. The new House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal proportion returned by either Province. In the same year (1840) also Municipal Institutions were established in Canada.

The Provincial Legislature was empowered by Act 17 & 18 Vic., cap. 118 (1854), to constitute the Legislative Council an elective body.

The constitution of Canada lately in operation was defined in its main features under title I. of the Consol. Stat. 1859. Under these Acts Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 members who were elected, and 22 members who were nominated under the old constitution.

Of the 48 elected members, 24 were for Upper Canada and 24 for Lower. They were arranged in four sets, and were chosen respectively in 1856, 1858, 1860, and 1862.

In 1855 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having almost come to a "dead lock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867," which forms part III of this article.

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. The cattle trade is also assuming considerable proportions, large numbers being exported annually to England. The same remark applies to dairy produce.

Free grants of land (from 100 to 200 acres) may be obtained, and improved farms (with buildings) can be bought at from 4l. to 12l. per acre.

The educational system is very perfect. It is compulsory, and there are no school fees.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Is now incorporated with Canada. It is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., and is connected with New Brunswick by a low sandy isthmus; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. It contains an area of 21,731 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea; deducting this one-fifth part and the land unsuited for agricultural purposes, there are rather more than 5,000,000 acres of land fit for tillage. Grants of 100 acres can be obtained for about 9l., and im-
proved farms are to be purchased at moderate prices. The forests of Nova Scotia abound in good timber—the ash, the beech, the birch, the maple, the oak, the pine, and the spruce being the most common trees.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander by James I. in 1627. In 1632 it was again restored to France, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears that name is the capital of the colony.

The harbour of Halifax has an area of about 10 square miles, is open at all seasons, and its navigation is scarcely ever interrupted by ice. This harbour is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for, it is said, 1,000 ships. The British Government has at Halifax an extensive dockyard, and its principal naval station in North America.

The climate is healthy, but the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is frequently visited by dense fogs, and the variations of temperature within 24 hours are remarkably great, sometimes exceeding 60°. The greatest heat observed at Halifax by Captain Moorsom was 95° Fahr., and the extreme cold 10°.

Coal and iron ore are plentiful in Nova Scotia. Gold also has recently been discovered, and is yielding fair returns; but the greater portion of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the growth of fruit, though the superior fisheries, together with the ship-building and timber trade, give occupation to many.

**MANITOBA.**

Manitoba was erected into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 38 Vic., c. 8, taking effect from the 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined. It is declared to be bounded on the south by the 49th degree of latitude, on the north by the 50° 30' latitude, on the west by the 99th parallel of W. longitude, and on the east by the 96th parallel of E. longitude.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, fearing that they would be subject to a possibly stricter form of Government, rose in insurrection, and established a provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada. In September, 1870, Mr. A. G. Archibald assumed the administration of the Government.

In October, 1871 the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid. Mr. Archibald, isolated, and without the aid of troops, took measures for its defence, and
with this view accepted the co-operation of Riel and Lepine. The attack never took place.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence for two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights, chiefly in view of the acceptance of his services by Lieut.-Governor Archibald, as above stated.

The agricultural capabilities of this province are very highly spoken of. It contains about 9,000,000 acres of land admirably adapted for the production of wheat and all other crops. The soil is a rich black loam. The growth of Winnipeg, the chief city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants; now (1881) it has a population of about 10,000, and is increasing rapidly.

For some years past the province could only be reached by railway through the United States territory, but this (1881) that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg is opened, the benefit of which it is difficult to calculate.

The free-grant lands are almost all taken up, but good farms can be purchased at from $2 to $10 per acre.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America. It comprises, as at present constituted, the territory lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, and Vancouver Island, and extends from the frontier line of the United States on the south, to the Simpson and Finlay rivers, which form its northern boundary. The average breadth of the territory is about 250 miles, the length of its coast line about 450 miles, and its area (including Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Island) is roughly calculated at 465,978 square miles.

Until the year 1858, British Columbia formed part of the territory over which the Hudson's Bay Company possessed by licence from the Crown the exclusive right of trading. But in that year large discoveries of gold were made in the rivers of the country, which attracted a vast immigration of gold-diggers from California, and rendered it necessary for Her Majesty's Government to take measures to maintain order, and protect life and property. The Hudson's Bay Company's trading licence was therefore revoked, and the country erected into a Colony by an Act of the Imperial Parliament (21 & 22 Vict., cap, 99).

The Colony had, when first created, no form of Representative Government, laws being made by the Governor in the shape of proclamations, which were submitted to the Queen, and laid before both Houses of Parliament: in 1863 however, a Legislative Council was established by order in Council, to consist of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Surveyor-General, and the Collector of Customs; of five Magistrates from different parts of the country, and of five unofficial members, who were selected by the votes of the inhabitants of the respective districts, all but Chinese and Indians being allowed to vote. In 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was united to that of British Columbia by Imperial Act passed in accordance with the vote of the Legislature of the former Colony, and became in every respect an integral portion of the Colony of British Columbia. The number of the Legislative Council was increased from 15 to 23, consisting of the five executive officers before named, nine magistrates, and nine unofficial members selected by the votes of the inhabitants of the several districts. This Constitution was altered by Order in Council, 1870; and the number of the Council up to the Union was 15: 9 members elected by the people, and 6 nominated by the Governor.

By the Constitution Act, 1871, however, passed by the Legislative Council after the adoption of the Address for Union with Canada, in preparation for that Union, and in accordance with the 14th Article of the terms, the Legislative body was still further enlarged. The number of members was increased to 25, all to be elective; and the Act contained provisions necessary for introducing the system of Executive Administration known as "Responsible Government," intended to come into operation on completion of the Union.

The population of the country is chiefly migratory, consisting of mining adventurers from California and other parts of the world, and including considerable numbers of Chinese. The settled white population of the United Colony may be stated as between 10,000 and 16,000.

The revenue is raised principally by means of customs duties: there is no direct taxation, except upon traders and miners.

The climate is temperate, and milder than that of the rest of the continent of North America, in the same latitude, east of the Rocky Mountains. Besides gold, the country produces magnificent timber and good coal. Gold quartz mining is now being prosecuted with considerable vigour, and reasonable hopes of success. Promising indications of silver have been discovered in several localities. Some of the ore having been assayed has yielded at the rate of 250l. to the ton. These leads are now being thoroughly tested. Seams of excellent anthracite coal have been discovered in Queen Charlotte Island, and works are now in progress there.

Agricultural operations have been greatly extended during the last five years, and have proved the character of the land throughout the colony to be admirably adapted for the culture of cereals. Land once thought valueless is now under heavy crops. The wheat, barley, oats, and other farm produce of the Colony may compare favourably with that raised even in California. Grist mills are gradually being erected. Tracts of good grazing land exist throughout the Colony, but the districts of Shemilkaineeen, Okanagan, and Nicola Lake, offer excellent pasture land. The spars manufactured from the Douglas pine bear the highest commercial value, for size, strength, and durability. The "lumber" trade is gradually on the increase; there being an unlimited supply of fine timber throughout the Colony.

The fur trade of this part of the world is also a noticeable feature. The skins exported chiefly consist of mink, marten, sable, silver fox, bear, beaver, sea and land otter, fur seal, deer, elk, raccoon, stifleur, and others of minor importance. This trade was originally a monopoly of the Hudson Bay Company, but is now open.

Large quantities of excellent cranberries yearly find a ready sale in California.

The Fraser River abounds in salmon, sturgeon, and a small fish called the "oulakon," of great
delicacy, resembling the sardine, which is found in enormous shoals. But fishing as an industry has not been hitherto extensively carried on. The sea fisheries consist of herring, cod, smelt, and halibut, all in great abundance.

There is a continuous line of telegraph from New Westminster to England, and a line passes through the Colony from south to north, thus placing even the remote district of Cariboo in direct communication with America and Europe.

The acquisition of land under pre-emptive right is simple and inexpensive: any British subject can take up a claim of 160 acres of land, and settle upon the same, with the certainty of not being called upon to pay for the land until it is included in the survey of the Colony, and then at a rate not exceeding £4. 2d. an acre. Any quantity of land immediately adjacent to a pre-emptive claim can be purchased by the pre-emptor of such claim upon payment down of half the purchase-money; the remainder when the land is surveyed—in no case exceeding £4. 2d. per acre in the whole. Town lots and suburban lands are put up for sale by public auction.

Vancouver Island lies off the north-west coast of North America, between N. lat. 48° 20' and 50° 55', and W. long. 128° 10' and 128° 20', and has an extreme length of 275 miles, and a breadth varying from 40 to 50 miles. It is separated from the mainland by a channel, called in various parts by the names of Queen Charlotte's Sound, Johnstone Strait, and Gulf of Georgia. On the south it is divided from the Washington territory by the Juan de Fuca Strait. Its area has been roughly estimated at 75,684 square miles, the greater proportion of which is mountain and rock.

The whole country is more or less densely wooded, excepting where the summit of the mountains (which rise to the height of nearly 16,000 feet) affords no hold for plants. The soil is fertile and capable of successful cultivation. Coal, good in quality, has been found at many points, and has been worked to a considerable extent at Nanaimo on the east coast. A large quantity of this coal is exported to San Francisco and South America. The climate is beautiful, more especially from early summer to late autumn.

The chief town of the island is Victoria, situated at its south-eastern extremity, a flourishing town of 5,925 inhabitants. The number of the aborigines on the island has been estimated at about 17,000.

The first British Settlement in Vancouver Island was made at Nootka Sound, on the N.W. coast, about the year 1778, by some London merchants, whose intention it was to dispose there of the produce raised in China.

Spain, however, at this time laid claim to the west coast of America, south of lat. 60°. Spanish cruisers seized the British trading vessels, and detained their crews as prisoners. To resent this outrage, a large fleet was assembled at Spithead, but war was avoided through the concessions of Spain; the English merchants were indemnified, and the Spanish claims were virtually, though not formally, abandoned.

Until 1849, Vancouver Island was only occasionally resorted to by the servants of the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Companies; but in that year a lease of the island was granted to the former Company for 10 years. The Imperial Government, however, reserved to itself the right of resuming it at the expiration of this period, on certain conditions. Accordingly, in 1859 it was made a British Colony, Mr. (afterwards Sir James) Douglas, who had acted as Governor under the Hudson's Bay Company, was continued in that employment. In 1866 it was, as already stated, united by Imperial Act to British Columbia, and became an integral portion of this Colony. British Columbia entered the Canadian Union 20th July, 1871; since which time she has been represented in the Canadian Senate by three, and in the House of Commons by six members. During the latter part of 1879, tenders were asked for and contracts awarded for the construction of four sections of the Canadian Pacific Railway, situated within the province, viz., from Emary's Bar on the Fraser River, to Savana's Ferry on the North Thompson River, a distance in all of 127 miles. Work was commenced on these sections during the year 1880, and is being energetically prosecuted.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long.; its area is about 1,380,000 acres; it is about 140 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to the Government of Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1770.

The climate is milder than in the surrounding British Colonies, and it is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded.

The inhabitants are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture.

Responsible Government was established at Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General of Canada, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) composed of 9 members, a Legislative Council of 13 members, and a House of Assembly of 30 members. Both these bodies are elected by the people.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of these elects ten representatives and four councillors to the Local Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament.

The land tenure has for many years been a source of agitation in this Colony. At the close of the last century the whole island was parcelled into 66 lots, and these lots were distributed amongst various persons, with certain conditions attached to the grants which have been regarded as impracticable. The lands thus acquired were on most estates leased for terms of 999 years, at an annual rent of about one shilling an acre, and thus a system of absentee proprietorship was established. For several years the Local Government bought out the interests of the proprietors in their lands whenever favourable opportunities occurred. The land question has been disposed of by a compulsory Land Purchase Act passed by the provincial Legislature in 1875. This Act compels the proprietors to sell to the tenants, at a price to be fixed by the award of a majority of three Commissioners appointed under the Act. The majority of the Commissioners have made their award, giving the proprietors on the average about 5s. 6d. an acre.
The soil of the island is good, and especially adapted for oats and the raising of sheep and cattle.

THE NORTH WEST TERRITORIES.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North Western Territory (with the exception of such portion thereof as forms the Province of Manitoba), were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The territories are governed by a Lieutenant-Governor assisted by a Council not exceeding five members, subject to instructions given by Order in Council at Ottawa, or by the Secretary of State of Canada. Representatives may be returned from time to time to a Council or Assembly according as districts containing an area of 1,000 square miles attain a population of not less than 1,000 inhabitants of adult age, exclusive of aliens or unenfranchised Indians.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to this district also. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that the province has about 150,000,000 acres of and suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlements.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

The following are the Provisions of Her Majesty's Order in Council respecting the incorporation of British Columbia, dated 16 May, 1871, issued under the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, as therein provided.

3. The following sums shall be paid by Canada to British Columbia for the support of its Government and Legislature, to wit, an Annual Subsidy of $35,000, and an Annual Grant equal to 80 cents per head of the said population of 60,000, both half-yearly in advance, such Grant of 80 cents per head to be augmented in proportion to the increase of population, as may be shown by each subsequent decennial census, until the population amounts to 400,000, at which rate such Grant shall thereafter remain, it being understood that the first census be taken in the year 1881.

4. The Dominion will provide an efficient Mail Service, fortnightly, by steam communication between Victoria and San Francisco, and twice a-week between Victoria and Olympia, the vessels to be adapted for the conveyance of freight and passengers.

6. Suitable Pensions, such as shall be approved by Her Majesty's Government, shall be provided by the Government of the Dominion for those of Her Majesty's servants in the Colony whose position and emoluments derived therefrom would be affected by political changes on the admission of British Columbia into the Dominion of Canada.

7. It is agreed that the existing Customs' Tariff and Excise Duties shall continue in force in British Columbia until the Railway from the Pacific Coast and the system of Railways in Canada are connected, unless the Legislature of British Columbia should sooner decide to accept the Tariff and Excise Laws of Canada. When Customs and Excise Duties are, at the time of the Union of British Columbia with Canada, leviable on any Goods, Wares, or Merchandises in British Columbia, or in the other Provinces of the Dominion, those Goods, Wares, and Merchandises may, from and after the Union, be imported into British Columbia from the Provinces now composing the Dominion, or from either of those Provinces into British Columbia, on proof of payment of the Customs or Excise Duties leviable thereon in the Province of Exportation, and on payment of such further amount (if any) of Customs or Excise Duties as are leviable thereon in the Province of Importation.

11. The Government of the Dominion undertake to secure the commencement simultaneously, within two years from the date of the Union, of the construction of a Railway from the Pacific towards the Rocky Mountains, and from such point as may be selected, east of the Rocky Mountains, towards the Pacific, to connect the seaboard of British Columbia with the Railway system of Canada; and further, to secure the completion of such Railway within ten years from the date of the Union.

And the Government of British Columbia agree to convey to the Dominion Government, in trust, to be appropriated in such manner as the Dominion Government may deem advisable in furtherance of the construction of the said Railway, a similar extent of Public Lands along the line of Railway throughout its entire length in British Columbia, not to exceed however twenty (20) miles on each side of said line, as may be appropriated for the same purpose by the Dominion Government from the Public Lands in the North-west Territories and the Province of Manitoba: Provided that the quantity of Land which may be held under Pre-emption right or by Crown Grant within the limits of the tract of land in British Columbia to be so conveyed to the Dominion Government, shall be made good to the Dominion from contiguous Public Lands; and provided further, that until the commencement, within two years as aforesaid from the date of the Union, of the construction of the said Railway, the Government of British Columbia shall not sell or alienate any further portions of the Public Lands of British Columbia in any other way than under right of Pre-emption, requiring actual residence of the Pre-emptor on the land claimed by him. In consideration of the land to be so conveyed in aid of the construction of the said Railway, the Dominion Government agree to pay to British Columbia, from the date of the Union, the sum of $100,000 per annum, in half-yearly payments in advance.

12. The Dominion Government shall guarantee the interest for ten years from the date of the completion of the works, at the rate of five per centum per annum, on such sum, not exceeding 100,000/. sterling, as may be required for the construction of a first-class Graving Dock at Esquimalt.

13. The charge of the Indians, and the trusteeship and management of the Lands reserved for their use and benefit, shall be assumed by the Dominion Government, and a policy as liberal as that hitherto pursued by the British Columbia Government shall be continued by the Dominion Government after the Union.

To carry out such Policy tracts of land of such extent as it has hitherto been the practice of the British Columbia Government to appropriate for that purpose, shall from time to time be conveyed by the Local Government to the Dominion Government in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians on application of the Dominion Government; and in case of disagreement between the two Governments respecting the quantity of such tracts of Land to be so granted, the matter shall be referred for the decision of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

14. The Constitution of the Executive Authority and of the Legislature of British Columbia shall, subject to the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867, continue as existing at the time of the Union until altered under the Authority of the said Act, it being at the same time understood that the Government of the Dominion will readily consent to the introduction of Responsible Government when desired by the inhabitants of British Columbia, and it being likewise understood that it is the intention of the Governor of British Columbia, under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to amend the existing Constitution of the Legislature by providing that a majority of its Members shall be elective.
