Geographical Features

The Island is mountainous and rises in the centre to 7,402 feet (Blue Mountain Peak). The area of land over 1,000 feet above sea level is 2,110 square miles. There are numerous rivers. Forest lands comprise about 400,000 acres, of which 232,000 constitute the Government Forest Reserves.

Climate

Generally speaking, the rainy months are May and October but in the extreme north-east winter rains fall between November and January. The heaviest annual rainfall, which exceeds 200 inches, occurs near the Blue Mountain Ridge in the north-east, the lowest in the extreme south. Hurricanes occur on the average once in seven years. The following table shows the temperatures and rainfall for selected places in 1955.

History

The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

Constitution

On the 5th May, 1953, the Constitution granted in 1944 was extended by the Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council, 1953, the principal features of which provided for:

(1) the appointment of a Chief Minister and seven Ministers charged with the responsibility of Government Departments by the Governor on the recommendation of the Chief Minister;

(2) the replacement of five elected members in Executive Council by eight Ministers thereby ensuring a majority of the elected element in that body.

In July, 1955, provision was made for a ninth Minister.

The present constitution provides for a Privy Council, an Executive Council, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary and two nominated unofficial members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy.

The Executive Council is presided over by the Governor and consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, two unofficial nominated members from the Legislative Council and nine Ministers.

The Legislature consists of two Houses, the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of three ex officio members, and not less than twelve unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The Council elects one of its unofficial members who is not a member of the Executive Council to be its President.

The House of Representatives consists of 32 members elected by adult suffrage from constituencies into which the Island is divided. At its first meeting the House elects one of its members to be Speaker. The Chief Minister and eight Ministers are appointed by the Governor from among its members. In the case of the Chief Minister, the name of the person whom it is proposed to appoint is submitted to the House for approval before appointment is made. The eight Ministers are appointed on the recommendation of the Chief Minister.

Land Policy

Appreciable areas of Government-owned lands, with the exception of Forest Reserves, have been disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure. However, in recent years, experiments have been carried out under a leasehold scheme. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. No land in the Island shall, however, be held by, or by any person in trust for or for the benefit of, the government of any foreign country, without a licence from the Governor in Council.

Taxation

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, death duties—namely, (a) estate, (b) legacy and (c) succession duties—and the licence duty on motor vehicles and on other personal properties. Taxes on real properties are collected on the basis of the improved value. This is defined as the actual present gross value of the property.
Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duty and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment.

**Public Finance**

| Year    | Revenue (£)   | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39 | 2,840,142    | 2,854,021       |
| 1951–52 | 13,798,426   | 14,346,654      |

| 1955–56*| 19,328,700   | 18,930,910      |

* Revised Estimates.

It was estimated that in 1955–56 £10,678,050 of revenue was derived from Customs and Excise and £4,543,900 from direct taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were estimated to be:

- Administration, Law and Justice: £2,939,771
- Communications and Public Works: £3,795,083
- Education: £2,457,975
- Public Health: £2,489,193
- Social Welfare: £2,503,833
- Agriculture: £1,033,602

Up to the end of March 1956 nearly £4,000,000 had been received from H.M.G. for rehabilitation assistance after the 1951 hurricane. This assistance is due to end in March, 1957. Receipts from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds totalled £414,482 in 1954–55 and £620,485 in 1955–56.

A Loan of £3,500,000 was successfully raised on the London money market in early 1953. A loan of £350,000 was raised on the local market in 1954; one of £600,000 in 1955 and one of £750,000 in the summer of 1956. The Public Debt now stands at £18,138,315 with Sinking Funds amounting to approximately £4,716,976.

**Development Plans**

In addition to approximately £1,250,000 carried over from the previous allocation, Jamaica has been given an allocation of £3,000,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act for the period 1955–60. A five-year development programme covering this period is being prepared.

**Currency**

British silver and cupro-nickel coins of all denominations circulate freely. Nickel and bronze alloy subsidiary coinage of 1d., ½d., and ¼d. denominations are in circulation. Jamaica Government currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1956, amounted to £6,286,143 17s. 6d. Since July, 1955, currency notes of the British Caribbean Currency Board have been legal tender in Jamaica.

**Education**

The University College of the West Indies, at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Arts, Science, Medicine and Education. In the 1955–56 session there were 444 students. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School which had 526 students in 1955. The Government awarded nine scholarships for higher education in 1955, tenable at the University College of the West Indies or in the United Kingdom or Canada. There were 101 Jamaicans with scholarships at Universities in the United Kingdom, four in Canada and two in the U.S.A. There were also 183 Jamaican students in Canada and 588 in the United States.

In 1955 there were 28 secondary schools with an enrolment of about 8,500 and 702 primary schools with an enrolment of 227,611.

Expenditure on education (including educational services by the Local Authorities, etc.) in 1955 was £2,590,000 of which about £112,887 was contributed by the United Kingdom. In 1935 the expenditure was £226,392.

**Libraries, Museums, etc.**

The Institute of Jamaica, a cultural centre of the Island, includes a general Lending Library, a West India Reference Library and a Museum. The Museum contains a comprehensive survey of exhibits dealing with geology and plant and animal life.

**Health**

During 1955–56 the Government spent £2,249,428 on its medical services, which are organized on an island-wide basis. This figure includes an expenditure of £44,047 from the Sweepstake Fund, but excludes the cost of maintenance and the construction of buildings. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United States of America and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: helminthiasis, yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis. The island has recently suffered outbreaks of poliomyelitis and typhoid fever, the first epidemics for many years.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of sanitary inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine, public health nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws and malaria. There are four mobile health units which carry on a generalized public health programme in different areas.

The following are the government hospitals in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,668 beds).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (110 beds and 110 cribs).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (228 beds).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (180 beds).
- Mental Hospital (2,985 beds).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (186 beds).

There are altogether 135 hospital outstations and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during 1954–55 was approximately 570,400.

The University College Hospital of the West Indies provides accommodation for 290 in-patients. Eventual accommodation for 500 beds is planned. There are large Casualty and Out-patient Clinics.
Communications

The international airports are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. Government-owned internal airstrips are provided at Boscobel and Braco and there are eighteen private airstrips in the Island.

The airport at Palisadoes is to be expanded so as to be capable of accommodating the largest aircraft in use.

Palisadoes Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Avianca Airlines, and numerous non-scheduled operators.

Montego Bay Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, Avianca Airlines, Delta Chicago and Southern Airlines, Avensa Airlines and Trans-Canada Air Lines.

Meteorological services are provided by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service, air traffic and associated services by the Civil Aviation Department and aeronautical telecommunications facilities and radio aids to navigation by International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The Jamaica Government Railway has 208½ miles of main railway line and 37 miles of sidings. The main routes are:

(a) Kingston—Montego Bay.
(b) Kingston—Port Antonio.
(c) Kingston—Frankfield.
(d) Kingston—Linestead.

During the financial year 1955–56, the railway carried 1,088,180 passengers who paid £141,858, and 773,087 tons of freight from which £517,912 was earned. Over four miles of track have been laid in connexion with the operations of the bauxite companies now operating in Jamaica.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring; the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges, culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,658 miles of main roads, of which 958 miles are asphalted, the remainder being of waterbound macadamized surface; and about 4,438 miles of parochial roads, of which approximately 2,137 miles are suitable for motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Messrs. Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers’ Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Harrison Lines, the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, and the Sitmar Line; with Canada by the Canadian National Steamship Company and Saguenay Terminals Limited; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company, the Alcoa Steamship Company and Three Bays Line; with the other British West Indian Islands by the S.S. West Indian (subsidized by the various British West Indian Governments) and Three Bays Line; with Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Bremen and Antwerp by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company and with South America and Europe by Fratelli Grimaldi Line and Sicular Oceanic Lines; with India, Ceylon, Cape Town, Durban and Mauritius by the Nourse Line; with Australia and New Zealand by the New Zealand Shipping Company, Port Line, Shaw Savill and Albion Company and Ellerman, Bucknall Company Limited; with the Far East (Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines) by the de-la-Rama Steamship Lines. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. During 1955 incoming cargo was estimated at 339,295 tons and outgoing at 1,587,956 tons.

Broadcasting

The Jamaica Broadcasting Company Limited operates a 17 hour a day commercial broadcasting service for the Island using short and medium wave and frequency modulation with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired broadcasting service in urban and suburban Kingston. There are approximately 15,000 subscribers. It is estimated that the radio and wired broadcasting audience is approximately 500,000. Ten per cent. of the Company’s time is used by the Government of Jamaica and the Company relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

Principal Occupations

The estimated gainfully occupied population in the principal industries and services, according to the 1953 sample survey of population, numbered:

| Industry                                      | Population |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Agriculture                                   | 299,482    |

| Unspecified                                   | 35,133     |
| **Total**                                     | **613,072** |

Aided by the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Law, the industrial development of the Island has continued. New laws to encourage industrial and commercial investment in the Island were passed in 1956. At the end of 1955 the number of registered factories was 732 employing 27,402 persons. At 31st March, 1955, the number of registered unions was 15, with a total membership of 103,648. The largest, the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union, had an approximate membership of 64,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar-cane, bananas, tobacco, coffee, cocoa, pimento, citrus, rice and maize. In 1955 3,566,025 tons sugar cane and about 14½ million 24-lb. bunches of bananas were produced.

Products and manufactures include sugar, cornmeal, condensed milk, margarine, butterine, lard, rum, beer, cigarettes, matches; 599,900,000 cigarettes were made in 1954.

Minerals won are bauxite, quantities of which are exported for processing, and gypsum. One of the three bauxite companies processes alumina in Jamaica.

Tourist Trade

The value of tourist trade in 1954 was estimated to be £5,774,228 and had increased in 1955 by 10·4% to £6,374,851.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The major export crops are handled by the following marketing organizations:

- The Marketing Department.
- The Coffee Industry Board.
- The Cocoa Marketing Board.
- The Sugar Manufacturers’ Association (of Jamaica) Limited;
- The Citrus Growers’ Association.
- The Banana Board.

Under the Coffee Industry Regulation Law (Law 43 of 1948) and the Cocoa Marketing Law (Law 40 of 1951), the Coffee Industry Board and the Cocoa Marketing Board were appointed on the 2nd June, 1950 and 1st March, 1952 respectively. These Boards are given wide statutory powers to regulate and develop these industries.

The Exports Division of the Marketing Department is the sole exporter of pimento and cocoa (the latter on behalf of the Cocoa Marketing Board).

The Sugar Manufacturers’ Association (comprising all the sugar manufacturers in Jamaica) provides the liaison between the sugar industry, the Government of Jamaica, and overseas interests. It deals with all aspects of the sugar industry, and sells co-operatively sugar for local consumption and all rum and other by-products.

As far as exports are concerned, during the war and up to 1952 when the British Ministry of Food purchased the entire exportable surplus, the Sugar Manufacturers’ Association acted for the entire industry. The position now is that under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21st December, 1951, Jamaica is entitled from that year onwards, to a Global Quota, divided into a Negotiated Price Quota and a Free Quota. The former is sold to the Ministry of Food at annually negotiated prices, and the latter is disposed of through commercial channels, as in the years before the war. There is also a small International Quota which is disposed of through commercial channels.

Through its subsidiaries, the Sugar Manufacturers’ Association maintains substantial interests in firms engaged in the manufacture of commodities ancillary to the sugar industry, e.g.:

- Wholly owned subsidiaries—Jamaica Carbonics, Ltd.; Anhydrous Alcohol, Ltd.
- Minority share-holders in—Jamaica Oxygen and Acetylene, Ltd.
The Citrus Growers' Association has full responsibility for the industry, and is the sole exporter of citrus, which is marketed co-operatively for its members. It operates a processing plant and packing house, which, together with independent processors and packers, obtain quotas of fresh fruits for packing and canning. These arrangements do not include limes, lemons and ugli.

The Banana Board was appointed on 1st October, 1953 under the Banana Board Law (Law 24 of 1953). The Board is the sole exporter of bananas and has wide powers over the industry.

On the 31st December, 1955, there were 155 Co-operative societies with 21,578 members, and total Share Capital of £275,893 registered under the Co-operative Societies Law.

CAYMAN ISLANDS

Area

The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population

At the 1943 census the population was 6,670: Grand Cayman 5,311, Cayman Brac 1,296, Little Cayman 63. Roughly classified according to racial origin 1,052 are of African, 3,518 of mixed and 2,100 of European descent. The estimated population at the end of 1955 was 8,266.

Principal Towns

Georgetown and West Bay have populations of 1,700 and 2,000 respectively.

Geographical Features

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is about 178 miles to the west of Jamaica. It is about 22 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to eight miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few
fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate

From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, and temperatures range from 60° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown averages 60 inches per annum. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, resulting in considerable depopulation of the latter. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system.

History

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 27) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica, and these, with 27 elected members known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly of Justices and Vestry under the presidency of the Commissioner. Enactments are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica. The Legislature of Jamaica may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Cayman Islands and may amend or repeal any laws locally passed. The present constitution dates from 1832.

Land Policy

All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

A poll tax of 8s. per adult male between the ages of 16 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 15% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938–39 | 13,253      | 11,859          |
| 1951–52 | 41,327      | 57,806          |
| 1952–53 | 53,613      | 51,738          |
| 1953–54 | 76,788      | 98,436          |
| 1954–55 | 87,286      | 71,327          |
| 1955–56 | 104,850     | 81,500          |

In 1955–56, £60,500 was estimated to be derived from Customs receipts and £17,000 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of estimated expenditure were Treasury, Customs and Post Office £11,177, Education £11,322, Medical £9,174 and Public Works Recurrent £8,933.

The Public Debt as at 31st March, 1955, was as follows:

- Hurricane Loan 1932: outstanding £471.
- Public Works Loan, 1932: outstanding £1,678.

Reserve Funds at that date totalled £41,896.

Development

The Islands have, under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, an allocation of £60,000. Plans are being worked out for a road improvement programme and for the construction of a new elementary school at Georgetown. In the last few years a number of hotels catering for tourists have been opened on Grand Cayman.

Education

There is compulsory free elementary education in 11 Government Schools; expenditure in 1955–56 amounted to £11,322 compared with £1,275 in 1938. There are two private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman. One of them receives financial support from Government.

Libraries

There is a well-equipped public library in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.

Health

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1955–56 was £9,174, compared with £1,091 in 1938. The hospital has accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded to the Dependency from Jamaica.

Communications

The airport at Crewe Road in Grand Cayman is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costaricenses, S.A. There are regular air services between Grand Cayman and Kingston, Belize, Miami, San José (Costa Rica) and Panama City. A 2,000ft airstrip has been constructed in Cayman Brac and a regular service by light aircraft is in operation.

A regular monthly steamship service is maintained between Kingston, Tampa (Florida) and all three islands. There is also more or less regular communication with Kingston, Florida and Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels.

Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, but no roads exist in Little Cayman.

Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. There are no broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment with overseas shipping companies. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of
living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, but no unions have been registered. There is no unemployment.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and thatch rope. The manufacture of thatch rope was at one time the mainstay of the poorer people, but the industry is now in decline.

| Year | Total Imports (£) | Domestic Exports (£) |

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

Area

The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 75 by 50 miles to the south-east of the Bahama Islands. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.

Population

The total population is estimated at 6,600.

Principal Towns

The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with estimated populations of 1,800, 600 and 1,400 respectively.

Geographical Features

The Turks Islands consist of two inhabited islands, Grand Turk and Salt Cay, six uninhabited cays, and a large number of rocks. The principal islands of the Caicos group are South Caicos, East Caicos, Middle (or Grand) Caicos, North Caicos, Providenciales and West Caicos. Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 20-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 25 inches. The temperature ranges throughout the year from 60° to 90°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1926, 1928 and 1945.

A United States weather bureau is maintained by Cable and Wireless Limited at Grand Turk.

History

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1834 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to the present time they have been one of its dependencies.

In 1953 the United States Government completed a Guided Missiles Observer Station at Grand Turk, under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement.

A United States Government Naval Facility for Oceanographic Measurement was established at Grand Turk in 1954.

Constitution

An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. This Board now consists of four official and eight unofficial members. Elections, based on adult suffrage, were held for the unofficial seats for the first time in 1953. The Commissioner is ex officio President of the Board, which has full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances require the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica do not apply to the Dependency unless they are made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent of those of Jamaica.

Land Policy

Much of the land on the salt islands is held on private freehold title. The law limiting the rights of aliens to own land was repealed in 1953.
Taxation

The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties, royalty on salt and stamp sales. There is no direct taxation.

Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938-39  |            |                 |
| 1951-52  | 121,767    | 143,213         |
| 1952-53  | 78,389     | 78,760          |
| 1953-54  | 73,103     | 64,047          |
| 1954-55  | 84,857     | 89,289          |
| 1955-56 (revised) | 88,726 | 98,078        |

The estimated main source of local revenue in 1955-56 was £31,800 from Customs dues. The estimated main heads of expenditure in the same year were: Medical Department £9,415; Commissioner's Department £10,800; Education £6,850; Relief Works £7,600. In 1956 provision was made for the first time for a grant-in-aid from Her Majesty's Government or the years 1955-56 and 1956-57.

Development Plans

The islands have an allocation of £60,000, under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Up to 31st March, 1956, the total assistance authorized under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945, for the Dependency amounted to £201,650, including interest-free loans of £50,000 towards the cost of taking over the salt industry from its previous owners and £5,000 to provide working capital. The main heads of actual expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds up to 31st March, 1956, are as follows:

| Head                  | Amount (£) |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Agriculture           | 4,346     |
| Communications        | 27,777    |
| Education             | 18,984    |
| Miscellaneous         | 8,015     |
| Public Health         | 44,275    |
| Salt Industry         | 74,740    |
| Social Welfare        | 423       |
| Water Supplies        | 8,262     |
| **Total**             | **186,822** |

Plans are being worked out for further capital investment in the salt industry; the reorganization of the statutory salt company, which is a necessary preliminary, is being negotiated. Colonial Development and Welfare assistance has been given to back a guarantee for the air service to the islands and for teachers' refresher courses. Schemes have also been approved for the construction of additional sea defences, and for the purchase and installation of a generator for a small X-ray unit.

Education

There are 12 Government Elementary Schools and one Senior School in the Dependency. In 1955 there were some 1,034 pupils on the rolls and the average attendance was 747. Expenditure on education during 1955-56 amounted to £6,500, compared with £840 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a public library at Grand Turk.

Health

There is a 16-bed cottage hospital of modern design at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. Medical officers, seconded from Jamaica, are stationed at Grand Turk and at Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos. There is a clinic at Cockburn Harbour and a maternity clinic at Bottle Creek on North Caicos. Expenditure on medical services in 1955-56 was £9,415, compared with £990 in 1935. Half the salaries of all trained staff is now contributed by the Jamaica Government.

Communications

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. The former is a military airstrip constructed by the United States Government in connexion with the Guided Missile Project. A weekly air service with Nassau was begun in 1956. There is a fortnightly mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from England and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio telephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are normally engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and shipping of salt, but the industry is now in a state of acute depression owing to lack of modern loading facilities. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen, and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

Main Crops and Products

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. Salt is the main product of the Dependency and the output over the past 25 years has averaged about 43,000 tons annually. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida, and conchs are sold dried in Haiti.
