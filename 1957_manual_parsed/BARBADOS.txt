BARBADOS

Area, etc.

Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands. Its total area is 166 square miles.

Population

At the end of 1955 the population was estimated at 229,113; the 1946 census gives the racial divisions as:

| Descent          | Percentage |
|------------------|------------|
| African descent  | 77.24%     |
| Mixed descent    | 17.55%     |
| European descent | 5.10%      |

Principal Town

Bridgetown, the capital, is the only town. Its population is about 85,000.

Geographical Features

The Island is comparatively flat, rising in a series of tablelands marked by well-defined terraces to the highest point (1,104 feet) at Mount Hillaby. The north-east corner of the Island, the Scotland area, is broken country, much eroded and rather barren. The formation of the rest of the Island is coral limestone. There are no rivers, but deep gullies which fill with water during heavy rain have cut their way through the coral terraces in many places. Indigenous forest covers about 46 acres.

Climate

The climate is extremely pleasant. North-easterly trade winds blow steadily from December to June but during the remainder of the year, the wet season, the wind moves to the south-east and is less strong, resulting in humid, hotter conditions. The average temperature is 79.8°. The rainfall is very varied; in the high central district the yearly average is 75 inches while in some of the low-lying coastal areas the average is 50 inches.

History

Uncertainty remains on some points in the early history of Barbados and differing versions have appeared from time to time. The brief account which follows is based on what is taken to be the most authentic version.

As far as is known the original inhabitants were the Arawak Indians who migrated from the mainland of South America. When they arrived is not known, but relics of their occupation down to the latter years of the sixteenth century have been discovered in various parts of the Island. By the time the English settlers came they had disappeared, partly through Carib raids from the neighbouring islands, and partly through the Spaniards who deported them to work in the mines of Hispaniola.
In spite of the belief to the contrary, there is no satisfactory evidence that the Olive Branch under Captain Catlin ever touched at Barbados when it was driven off its course from England to the River Wiapoco settlement in 1605 and fetched up at St. Lucia. The first Englishman to visit Barbados may have been Captain Simon Gordan, who claimed that he had landed some time before the settlement of 1627 and had found the Island uninhabited. He may, however, have been on a ship under the command of Sir Thomas Warner that visited sometime between 1620 and 1624 and found the Island suffering from such a severe drought that the latter preferred settlement of his colonists at St. Kitts. In 1624 or early 1625 a ship, belonging to Sir William Courteen and under the command of Captain John Powell, touched at Barbados, when en route from Pernambuco to England; some men were landed who erected a cross and on a tree nearby inscribed "James K. of E. and of this Island". On receiving Powell's information about Barbados Sir William Courteen fitted out an expedition to the Island under the command of his informant; but Powell, who carried letters of marque, captured a Spanish or Portuguese prize and returned with it to Cowes in 1626. Courteen then fitted out a second expedition and in February, 1627, the William and John under the command of Captain Henry Powell—Captain John Powell's younger brother—landed 80 settlers. During 1627 and 1628 the colony grew rapidly and by the end of 1628 it was claimed that Courteen had planted 1,850 settlers. The Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I for all the Caribbean islands and landed settlers in 1628. After his death his son leased the Island in 1647 for 21 years to Lord Willoughby of Parham who assumed the government of the Island and during the Civil War held it for the Royalists until his capitulation to the Cromwellian fleet in 1652. A Governor was appointed by the Commonwealth in place of Lord Willoughby and at the Restoration the claims of the Carlisle Patent were revived. An agreement was reached by which the Patent was surrendered to the Crown for compensation in the form of 4½% duty on exports. This duty was a continual source of complaint but was not abolished until 1838 by Act of Imperial Parliament. The importance of the agreement, however, is that it marked the end of proprietary rule. Since its settlement Barbados has been a possession of Great Britain.

**Constitution**

The Charter of Barbados was ratified by the Commonwealth Parliament in 1652. It provided, among other things, that the government of the Island should be vested in the Governor, Council and Assembly according to ancient and usual custom. The Island possesses a representative chamber of Legislature and a considerable measure of responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation. The Legislature consists of the Governor; the Legislative Council, consisting of 15 members appointed by Her Majesty; and a House of Assembly, consisting of 24 members, (two for each parish and two for the City of Bridgetown) elected by adult suffrage which was introduced in 1951. The life of a House of Assembly is limited to five years. The registered number of voters is 103,133.

The chief executive organ is the Executive Committee, which was formed in 1881 by Act of the Barbados Legislature and consists of the Governor-in-Executive Council (the original executive organ which now survives for a limited number of functions only and consists of the Chief Secretary and Attorney-General ex officio and such other persons as Her Majesty may appoint) associated with one member of the Legislative Council and four of the House of Assembly appointed by the Governor.

On 1st February, 1954, a Ministerial system was introduced under which five Ministers became responsible for most departments of Government. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly, and appoints four other Ministers on his recommendation. The Premier becomes a member of Executive Council, while he holds office, and the other Ministers become the four members of Executive Committee appointed from the House of Assembly. These changes have been introduced mostly by convention and have entailed only minor amendments of the Constitutional Instruments.

**Land Policy**

The systems of land tenure are similar to those of the United Kingdom.

**Taxation**

Income tax is the main form of direct taxation. The tax rates range from 3 cents on every complete $ of taxable income up to $500, to 75 cents on every complete $ of taxable income beyond $24,000. Tax is not paid on incomes below $720 per annum in the case of single individuals and $1,300 in the case of married persons. Deductions from taxable income of $270 are allowed for children and $240 for other dependants, in the latter case not exceeding two. Deductions are also permitted on life insurances. Medical expenses may be deducted in excess of $20 but not exceeding in the aggregate $100, in the case of a taxpayer of married status, or $50 in the case of any other person, plus $25 for each child, not exceeding two. Companies pay a flat rate of 40%. The rate for life assurance companies is the average paid by an individual with a taxable income of $4,800.

Estate duties range from 1% on estates not exceeding $4,800 to 30% on estates over $1,920,000. In addition, succession duty ranges from ½% between $96 and $2,400 to 2% at values exceeding $9,600 where the successor is a lineal descendant or ancestor and from 2% to 10% where the successor is a stranger.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariffs and excise duty on rum production.

Expenditure on Capital Account amounting to $4,732,224 was met from loan funds, surplus balances, Colonial Development and Welfare grants.

Included in this expenditure is an amount of $1,854,905 which represents capital expenditure resulting directly from damage caused by Hurricane "Janet".

The Public Debt at the 1st of April, 1956, was $4,905,728, approximately $21.4 per head of population. Towards this an amount of $1,951,426 was provided by sinking funds.

At 1st April, 1956, the amount of free surplus balances was $4,217,212.

Currency

The currency in circulation is a West Indian currency issued by the Board of the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern group) consisting of Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. Currency notes are of denominations $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100. British coin is legal tender but the chief medium of circulation is the new British Caribbean coin in denominations of 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents, 1 cent and a ½ cent. The West Indian $ is fixed at 4s. 2d., that is $4.80 to £1 sterling.

Development Plans

The Five-Year Development Plan for 1955-60 is at present under review. The major project is the construction of a Deep Water Harbour which will in the main be financed by an external loan. The remainder of the plan provides for the development of Housing, Water Supplies, Medical, Educational and Agricultural Services, Roads and Road Transport, the Airport, Rural Amenities and Natural Gas. It also provides funds to be placed at the disposal of a Development Board. The programme involves expenditure of some $50,000,000.

Education

Educational policy aims at the integration of the elementary and secondary systems of education and the eventual introduction of compulsory education for children between the ages of 5 and 14 years.

Education at the primary stage is provided in elementary schools, in the preparatory departments of Government-aided secondary schools and in independent schools. Secondary education is provided in the senior departments of the elementary schools, in secondary modern schools, Government-aided secondary grammar schools and some independent schools. No fees are charged in the elementary and secondary modern schools. Tuition fees in secondary grammar schools range from $12 to $72 per annum.

There are 118 elementary all-age schools, and 4 secondary modern schools, which are entirely maintained by Government funds. At the close of the school year 1955-56 the number of registered pupils was 36,014 (17,545 boys, 18,469 girls). There are 10 government-aided secondary grammar schools (3 first grade and 7 second grade) with an attendance of 3,316 pupils (2,201 boys, 1,115 girls). Eldiston Training College now provides a two-year residential course for approximately 100 students including 32 from the Windward and Leeward Islands. Under the Barbados Five-Year Training Scheme and the Caribbean Vocational Training Scheme scholarships are awarded annually to teachers in both Elementary and Government-aided Secondary Schools for study in the United Kingdom as well as Caribbean Institutions. Codrington College, affiliated to the University of Durham, is a Theological College. There were 24 students in residence during 1955-56.

During the academic year there were 32 Government Scholars and Exhibitioners attending Universities overseas: fourteen in the United Kingdom, three in Canada, and fifteen at the University College of the West Indies.

Adult Education is provided by the Barbados Evening Institute in Academic and Commercial courses and at the Housecraft Centre in Home Economics. Technical Education is now provided at the Technical Institute established in 1955. It offers courses at three levels, viz., for craftsmen, for technicians, and for those desirous of proceeding to advanced technological studies. The Board of Industrial Training awards 48 bursaries annually for training in various trades under apprenticeship schemes with master workmen, but its functions will soon be taken over by the newly established Apprenticeship Board.

Expenditure on education services in 1955-56 was over $2 million, compared with $269,342 in 1935-36, and $199,760 in 1925-26.

Libraries and Museums

A free Public Library (62,000 books) is maintained by Government. At British Council headquarters there are also a Music Library and a Reference Library. The Barbados Museum and Historical Society possesses collections of books, pictures, models, specimens of birds and fishes, and a collection of relics of the original Arawak inhabitants of the island.

Health

The Barbados General Hospital has accommodation for 44 paying patients and 372 non-paying patients. In-patient attendances number about 11,000, out-patient attendances about 115,000 per annum. The Government maintains a mental hospital with accommodation for 320 males and 471 females and a leper hospital at which there are 21 patients. For the training of midwives the Government Maternity Hospital has accommodation for 20 expectant mothers. Each of the 11 parishes has an almshouse for the care of the destitute sick and for the housing of the aged and poor. These almshouses are on the medical side in the nature of cottage hospitals.

Preventive medicine is based on the Health Centre System. At present two Centres are operating and a third one is proposed in the Five-Year Plan of Development.

Estimated expenditure on Health Services amounted to $1,810,626 in 1955-56 compared with $206,870 in 1935-36 and $195,375 in 1925-26.
Communications

The airfield is at Seawell, about 12 miles from Bridgetown. The main airlines operating are British West Indian Airways, linking with most of the other British West Indian Islands, B.O.A.C., providing a direct service to London, Trans-Canada Airlines providing a direct service to points in Canada, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana (LAV) and the St. Vincent Government Air Service.

There are 647 miles of bituminous surfaced road open to traffic.

Bridgetown is the only port of entry, although some loading of sugar takes place at Speightstown and oil is pumped ashore at Spring Gardens.

The main shipping companies visiting Barbados are Harrison Line, Elder and Fyffes Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamship Company and Saguenay Terminals. Occasionally ships of Furness Withy, Moore McCormack, Blue Star, Lamport and Holt and Booth Lines visit port.

Broadcasting

A wired system, which is now island-wide, is operated by a local company—Barbados Rediffusion Service Limited. It has 16,000 subscribers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in the cultivation of the sugar crop and auxiliary occupations connected with the sugar industry. The 1955 figures are:—23,000 persons engaged in agriculture, 14,000 in domestic service, 12,000 in the retail trade and 7,300 in construction work. About 2,500 persons are engaged in the fishing industry.

There are eight trade unions with some 18,000 members.

Main Crops and Products

Sugar cane is the principal export crop grown on all plantations and on nearly all small holdings. In 1956, sugar production was the equivalent of 151,171 tons.

Yams, sweet potatoes, eddoes, cassava, maize and pigeon peas comprise the main food crops which are grown in accordance with regulations issued annually. Green vegetables and other crops are cultivated on a minor scale and there is a limited production of tree crops and citrus fruit.

The estimated numbers of livestock are as follows:

- Cattle, 15,050; Pigs, 24,367; Sheep, 33,444; and Goats, 16,099.

A Central Livestock Station has been established to investigate the possibility of developing an economic system of animal husbandry, with special attention to dairying.

A Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture has been established in recent years for the investigation of more efficient methods of marine fishing and to encourage their use. The estimated catch of fish during 1955-56 was 10,500,000 lb. valued at $2,042,530.

Production of natural gas during the year ended March 31, 1956, was 131,383 M.c.f. During 1956, 6,852 tons of temper, building and manurial limestone were exported.

Manufactures include the production of sugar for local consumption, rum, bread and a variety of biscuits, edible oil, aerated waters, cigarettes, soap, ice and furniture.
