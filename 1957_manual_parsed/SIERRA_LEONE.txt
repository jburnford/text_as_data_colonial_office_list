**SIERRA LEONE**

**Area**

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925, South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

**Population**

The latest estimate of population was 2,260,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 2,130,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asiatics, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

Geographical Features

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

Climate

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground. Most of the rain falls in the three months July–September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10°, inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.

History

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

Constitution

That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

Royal Instructions of 1951 provided for an Executive Council of four ex officio members and not less than four unofficial members appointed from among the elected members of the Legislature. An amendment to the Royal Instructions made in April 1953 vested the six unofficial members of Executive Council with the title and responsibilities of Ministers. These provisions are now given effect in new Royal Instructions issued in 1956.

The Sierra Leone (House of Representatives) Order in Council, 1956, revokes an Order in Council made in 1951 which provided for a Legislative Council consisting of 32 members, and provides instead for a Legislature comprising 57 members, of whom four are ex officio members, 14 are elected from the Colony districts, 36 (including 12 Paramount Chiefs) are elected from Protectorate districts, one is elected from the Bo Urban Area, and two are nominated by the Governor (without voting rights) to represent special interests. The new House will meet for the first time early in 1957.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

Land Policy

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.
Taxation

There are three forms of direct taxation in force: income tax, poll tax, and local tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief; there are allowances for children (up to four) up to the age of 16 years or so long as they are receiving whole-time education; and for life assurance premiums up to certain limits. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. A double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government.

Poll tax is payable by non-natives at the rate of £4 a year and is offset against individual liability for income tax. A Local Tax Ordnance introduced in 1954 replaces the House Tax, formerly paid by all adult native males, by a Local Tax. This is subject to a maximum of 25s. per head, and within chiefdoms is paid at a fixed rate. In general terms payment applies to all adult male persons residing in each chiefdom and in certain cases to adult females also. Revenue from this tax is divided between District Councils and Native Administrations.

The two main forms of indirect taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duties.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 886,149    | 910,077        |

| 1955 | 7,545,788  | 7,397,335      |

In 1955, £4,262,591 of total revenue was derived from Customs and £1,518,684 from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

Development Schemes (excluding transfers of £382,045 to the Development and Education Funds from revenue) £907,736, Medical and Education Services £1,256,049, Public Works and Electricity recurrent £851,854, non-recurrent Public Works £391,463, Law and Order £490,670, Provincial Administration and the Secretariat £172,665.

The Public Debt at the end of December 1955 amounted to £4,410,582 (approximately £2 4s. 1d. per head of population) and comprised:

- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1958-63: £570,000
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968: £81,425
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968: £49,157
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968-70: £2,030,000
- 2nd Installment Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968-70: £1,680,000

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946 (and reviewed in 1949 when "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was published). The Plans provided for the development of Communications, Natural Resources and Social and Basic Services at a total cost of £5,000,000 in the ten-year period.

As a contribution towards this expenditure, an allocation of £2,600,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 was made.

The amount which it is expected to spend on development (largely on works construction) in the period 1st January 1956 to 31st December 1959 is £10,499,535 made up as follows:

- Lungi Airport: £94,483
- Inland Waterways: £13,500
- Freetown Electricity Supplies: £157,892
- Provincial Electricity Supplies: £181,404
- Provincial Water Supplies: £346,758
- Roads and Bridges: £2,091,629
- Railway and Port Development: £2,474,326
- Guma Valley Hydro-electric Scheme: £1,129,503
- Agriculture: £879,373
- Schools and Colleges: £1,650,821
- Hospitals and Clinics: £355,805
- Public Buildings and Housing Schemes: £1,050,000
- Fisheries Research: £74,041

£10,499,535

It is hoped to finance this programme from loan funds, the Development and Education Funds, and to the extent of £2,482,737 from the territory's allocations under the 1945 and 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. The allocation under the 1955 Act is £1,200,000.

Education

University courses in Divinity, Arts, Commerce and Education are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown. At the beginning of 1955-56 session, 245 students were in attendance at these courses and, apart from scholarships for secondary education and teacher training, 171 scholarships were awarded, 93 for higher education, including study overseas. About 26 students were known to be studying in the U.S.A.

There are five Teacher Training Colleges and one Teacher Training Department in the territory; 498 students, including 45 agricultural instructors, were in training in 1955.

There are two Government Secondary Grammar Schools, four Government Junior Secondary Schools and 14 assisted Secondary Schools and post-primary schools; 4,821 pupils were enrolled in 1955. There is also an unassisted Secondary School, which has 200 pupils. Four Government, 392 assisted and 25 unassisted Primary Schools had an enrolment of 48,934 pupils.

The Technical Institute, which opened in 1953, had over 400 students by the end of 1955, enrolled in engineering, carpentry, commercial and other technical and vocational courses.

Literacy campaigns were conducted in 1954 by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in 36 chiefdoms, and 1,463 reading certificates were issued. The Bureau reported that in ten years 34,000 people are estimated to have attained literacy in one
vernacular, while 301,000 books in five vernaculars (Mende, Temne, Limba, Kono, and Koranko), had been sold, 167,000 of them within the last five years of the period.

The Extramural Department of Fourah Bay College, the British Council and the Social Welfare Department organized adult education courses in various subjects.

Expenditure on education, other than under the Development Plan, was £767,372 in 1955. In 1935 total expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Libraries

Fourah Bay College has a library of some 12,000 volumes. The British Council maintains a subscription library of over 22,000 books and makes regular bulk loans of books and periodicals to the Protectorate. In Freetown there are also two small public libraries.

Health

Diseases contended with in Sierra Leone, in addition to such infections as typhoid and dysentery, which are common, include malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy, tuberculosis, goitre, rabies, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, smallpox, cerebro-spinal fever and yaws. The incidence of the last five is comparatively low. The Health Service includes an Endemic Diseases Control Unit, an Entomological Laboratory and the former Malaria Control Unit.

At the beginning of 1957 beds available in hospitals (including two Infirmarys and a maternity hospital) totalled 1,253 (Government 936, Missions 231, Mining 86). The latest treatment figures are for 1955, when in-patients at Government Hospitals numbered 12,188 and out-patients 177,131. At the 32 Government dispensaries (excluding 25 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) 116,179 new cases were treated.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1955 was £488,677. By comparison actual expenditure in 1935 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the only international airport in the territory and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Air Services are operated through Freetown Airport by Air France, Hunting-Clan/Airwork Services and West African Airways Corporation. They connect Sierra Leone to other parts of West Africa and provide a thrice-weekly service to and from the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.

Air and marine navigational aids, and aeradio and meteorological radio services, are also provided.

The railway carried 1,352,620 passengers and 95,403 tons of freight in 1955. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 339. This mileage included a branch line covering a distance of 83½ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 2,963 miles of road, 1,574 miles of trunk roads motorable throughout the year, and 1,389 miles of feeder roads.

Freetown is a port of British Shipping Registry, four miles up the Sierra Leone River and has one of the finest harbours in Africa. It is an oil-bunkering station for ocean-going vessels. Smaller ports are at Pepel, Bonthe and Sulima. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines; Bonthe and Sulima are loading ports for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and Palm Line, Limited, and to the Continent by Holland West Africa Line. A limited cargo service to the east coast ports of America is provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and the Barber Steamship Lines, and to South Africa by J. P. Holmen, Limited, and Elder Dempster Lines, Limited.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

Broadcasting

The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service, transmitting from Freetown, was inaugurated on the 19th October, 1955 and at present operates between the hours of 17·50 and 20·00 on a frequency of 3,316 kilocycles in the 90 metre band with a power of 5 kilowatts. The Service consists of approximately two hours' local programme and the remainder re-radiated B.B.C. Overseas Service. It is planned to extend the hours of direct broadcasting early in 1957. On the 1st October, 1956, the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 2,048.

Government also operates a wired system in Freetown which broadcasts local programmes and the B.B.C. Overseas Service. On the 1st October, 1956, the number of subscribers was 3,896.

The operation and maintenance of both systems are in charge of the Posts and Telegraphs Department, whilst programmes are arranged by the Public Relations Department.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population are engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups at the end of 1955 to be as follows : Building and construction 8,552 ; mining 5,572 ; transport (road, rail and air) 5,278 ; maritime and waterfront 2,084 ; commerce 5,211 ; and other principal industries and services (including public administration, health and agriculture) 14,922. These workers were employed by the following employers : Government 21,018 ; Native Administrations 2,613 ; Service Departments (civilian employees of War Department and Admiralty) 1,508 ; and major private and commercial undertakings 16,480.

In addition an estimated 32,500 workers were employed by smaller employers i.e. of less than six persons. During 1955 the average monthly figure of all workers in wage-earning employment was approximately 76,000.

There were, at the end of 1955, 12 registered trade unions with a total membership of 23,648, including one employers' union with 22 members.
Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, benniseed, kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: cattle 150,000, goats 25,000, sheep 10,000, pigs 5,000.

The main timber products are sawn timber, shingles, roundwood, firewood, charcoal and gum copal. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. Two Italian trawlers have recently begun operations from Freetown.

The Headquarters of the West African Fisheries Research Institute are situated at Kissy, near Freetown. The Institute's two research launches are undertaking the survey of the Sierra Leone River estuary. Two other estuaries north and south of Freetown are also being explored for possible fishing grounds.

The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite and molybdenite.

Nine pioneer oil mills for the expressing of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut oil and palm kernel oil is being operated by Government. Government also operates two small and two large rice mills and there are a number of privately-owned mills. Connected with the Government rice mills is the complementary enterprise of pig and poultry feed production.

Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise.

Village industries include fishing, fish curing and smoking, weaving, and hand methods of expressing palm oil and cracking palm kernels.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it. To this end the Board has erected nine pioneer mills for the extraction and processing of palm oil.

On 30th April, 1956, there were 233 Co-operative Societies, with 10,300 members and savings of £15,200. Their surplus and reserves totalled £18,500 and their turnover during the year ending on that date was £212,000.

Societies issued short term loans to members during the year amounting to £30,800. During the same period £28,900 was repaid by members. At the close of the period £15,000 was outstanding of which the greater part was not yet due.

In addition £3,000 of medium term loans were issued to societies to enable them to purchase agricultural machinery for mechanized rice cultivation; and £1,100 to one Society for purchasing means of transport.
