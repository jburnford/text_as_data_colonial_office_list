FEDERATION OF MALAYA

Area

The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,690 square miles. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang and the smallest is the State of Perlis.

Population

The total estimated population at 31st December, 1955, was 6,152,099.

| Group            | Population |
|------------------|------------|
| Malaysians        | 3,003,181  |
| Chinese          | 2,326,498  |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 729,013 |
| Europeans        | 16,878     |
| Eurasians        | 12,612     |
| Others           | 63,917     |
| **Total**        | **6,152,099** |

The Chinese predominate in the south-western States and in Penang, the commercial and industrial area, whereas there is a bigger percentage of Malaysians in the north and east and in Malacca.

Citizenship legislation which came into force on 15th September, 1952, confers citizenship by operation of law on all subjects of the rulers of the States and certain categories of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in the Federation. It is estimated that the number of persons who were citizens by operation of law at 31st December, 1955, was 4,427,845:

| Group            | Population |
|------------------|------------|
| Malaysians        | 2,915,597  |
| Chinese          | 1,231,226  |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 244,344 |
| Others           | 36,678     |
| **Total**        | **4,427,845** |

As a general rule for non-Malays who are not Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies the qualification necessary for automatic citizenship and State nationality is to have been born in the Federation and to have had one parent born there also. Non-Malays without this qualification may, under certain conditions, acquire citizenship by registration or naturalization. The policy behind the legislation is to make citizenship available (i) by operation of law to anyone who by birth can be assumed to be sufficiently assimilated to the life and loyalty of the country; and (ii) by registration or naturalization to others who have reasonable qualifications to be regarded as Malaysians.

Geographical Features

The Federation occupies the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the south-eastern corner of Asia between India and China. It is divided by mountain ranges, the main trend of which is north and south. The highest mountain is Gunong Tahan, 7,186 feet. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest
territory on the Asian mainland south of the Himalayas. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80% of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp. The coastline of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of bays. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand. The Settlement of Penang is on the Island of Penang about one mile off the west coast of the Peninsula and 70 miles south of the Federation's boundary with Siam. Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands (rising to over 2,000 feet) off the north Kedah coast, and off the east coast, Tioman and other scattered islands.

The two principal rivers are the Perak and the Pahang, both over 250 miles long.

That part of the country cleared of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas, as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other areas, particularly the Kinta Valley, Perak, have been mined for tin, and extensive areas have been planted with rubber.

Climate

The principal features of the climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of northern latitudes; but, apart from the east coast, the differences of climate normally associated with the word "monsoon" are barely discernible in Malaya. On the east coast, and for a few miles inland, the wettest period is from November to January. In most other places, maximum rainfall occurs in October and November with a less pronounced maximum in March and April. Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year though the annual fall varies considerably from place to place and year to year. Jelebu in Negri Sembilan is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches, and Maxwell's Hill in Perak the wettest, with an average of almost 200 inches a year.

The average maximum temperature in the plains is rather less than 90° F. and the average minimum about 72° F. At the hill stations temperatures are considerably lower; at Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 80° F. and 36° F. and at Fraser's Hill 82° F. and 53° F. The nights are reasonably cool everywhere and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not possible at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate is desirable for Europeans if health is to be maintained.

History

In 1786 Francis Light obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795 during the Napoleonic wars, but was handed back to the Dutch in 1814. The loss of Malacca caused Stamford Raffles to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. Raffles obtained a concession from the representative of the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. As a free port Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the entrepot trade. Malacca returned to British hands in 1824 when, by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London, Malaya was recognized as a British sphere of influence. The Straits Settlements of Penang, Malacca and Singapore which at first came under the India Office, passed to the control of the Colonial Office in 1867. The extension of British authority into the Peninsula was hastened by unsettled conditions in the Malay States which had deteriorated in some cases into civil war and disorder. In 1873 the new Governor of the Straits Settlements came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the Treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern States by the Treaty of Bangkok. In 1910 agreements were concluded with Kelantan and Trengganu (the latter amended in 1919) in 1923 with Kedah and in 1930 with Perlis. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were similar in their main features. The Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in turn guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each State a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the Rulers agreed to follow in all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The foundations of good government and friendly relations laid by such early Residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made Malaya one of the most prosperous territories in the Commonwealth. In the early years of the century Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a Federation (the Federated Malay States) with a Resident-General as chief executive officer, and a system of centralized government was inaugurated. This system lasted in varying forms until 1932, when there was a measure of decentralization by which legislative powers were to some extent restored to the States and the authority of the Rulers and Residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt stop during the Japanese occupation from December 1941 to August 1945. On the liberation of the country, the Government of the Malayan Union was established, but this administrative system met with strong objections by the Malays and on the 1st February, 1948, a new Constitution came into force. The new Constitution allowed each State and Settlement to retain its individuality under a strong central government. In 1955, the first national elections for filling the majority of seats in the central Legislature were held. Immediately following the elections the first Chief Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, was appointed and full Ministerial officers were appointed to the various portfolios held by Members of the Federal Executive Council.
Constitution

The Federation of Malaya, which comprises the nine Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu and the two British Settlements of Penang and Malacca, was constituted on 1st February, 1948, by:

(a) the Federation of Malaya Agreement, 1948, between His Majesty King George VI and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and Trengganu;

(b) the State Agreements between His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers; and

(c) the Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948.

The Federation of Malaya Agreement, as from time to time amended, provides for an Executive Council, presided over by the High Commissioner, consisting of not less than ten or more than 24 members, of whom two are ex officio, being the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General and the rest are appointed by the High Commissioner after consultation with the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Council. The Legislative Council itself consists of 98 members presided over by a Speaker; of these 52 are elected members, and 33 are appointed members representing commerce (6 members), rubber (6 members), tin (4 members), trade unions (4 members), agriculture and husbandry (2 members), racial minorities (3 members) and other interests (8 members); the majority of these members appointed to represent specific interests are by the Agreement required to be chosen by independent organizations and associations. The nine Mentri Mentri Besar (Chief Ministers) of the Malay States, two representatives of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca and the Chief Secretary and Attorney-General complete the Council.

The present Executive Council consists of twelve members of whom the Chief Minister, Minister of Finance and eight other Ministers are members of the Alliance Party; the Chief Secretary and Attorney-General are ex officio members of Executive Council.

Of the 52 elected members of the Legislative Council, 51 represent the Alliance Party formed by the combination of the United Malays National Organisation, the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress; one represents the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party. The first Federal elections, at which these seats were filled, were held on 27th July, 1955, and were based on the principle of universal adult franchise for all Federal citizens on a common electoral roll.

The Federation Agreement also established a Conference of Rulers, consisting of the nine Rulers of the Malay States, which consults with the High Commissioner at least three times a year.

The individual State Agreements made in 1948 between His Majesty King George VI and His Highness the Ruler of each State provide for State Executive Councils in each Malay State presided over by the Rulers, and Councils of State, which are legislative bodies, presided over by the Mentri Besar or Chief Minister of each State. The Federation of Malaya Order in Council, 1948, as subsequently amended, provides that in each of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca there shall be a Settlement Executive Council presided over by the High Commissioner, or in his absence by the Resident Commissioner, and a Settlement Council presided over by the Resident Commissioner; these Councils correspond respectively to the State Executive Councils and Councils of State of the Malay States. All the Councils of State and Settlement Councils have a proportion of elected members which, together with the unofficial members, are in a majority. In Penang, however, there is an elected majority in the Settlement Council. In all the States and Settlements an overwhelming majority, if not all, of the elected seats are held by members of the Alliance Party.

Certain changes in the constitution of the Federation were agreed at a Conference held in London in January/February 1956, which was attended by representatives of Her Majesty's Government, the Rulers of the Malay States and the elected Government of the Federation. As a result the Federation of Malaya has internal self-government but Her Majesty's Government continues to be responsible for external affairs and the external defence of the country. It was also agreed at the London Conference to appoint as soon as possible an independent Constitutional Commission to make recommendations for a new Constitution for the country with the object of making the Federation of Malaya a fully self-governing and independent member of the Commonwealth by 31st August, 1957, if possible. This Commission began work in Malaya in July, 1956. It comprises:

The Right Honourable Lord Reid, LL.D.,
F.R.S.E. (Chairman).
Mr. Justice Abdul Hamid.
Sir Ivor Jennings, K.B.E., Q.C.
Mr. B. Malik, M.A., LL.B.
The Right Honourable Sir William McKell,
G.C.M.G., Q.C.

The Commission expected to have completed their examination of the present constitutional arrangements by the end of October, 1956, after visiting all States and Settlements. Their report was published early in 1957 (Colonial No. 330).

Emergency

Since June 1948 a state of Emergency has existed in Malaya. Special powers were assumed by the Government in that month to preserve law and order in the face of outbreaks of violence perpetrated by the Malayan Communist Party. Communist terrorists have since then carried out guerrilla operations from jungle bases in an attempt, by ambush, murder and the destruction of property, to impose their will on the Malayan people. They have not succeeded in doing this, but they have caused a great deal of suffering to innocent people. The Government, with the assistance of its locally raised (and largely voluntary) Security Forces, as well as British and Commonwealth troops, and with the support of the large majority of the people of Malaya, has made great efforts to put down terrorism. After the murder in October 1951 of Sir Henry Gurney, the then High Commissioner and a devoted servant of the people of Malaya, General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed High Commissioner and Director of Operations and Mr. D. C. (now Sir Donald) MacGillivray, Deputy High Commissioner. These appointments were the first steps in a widespread reorganization of the Security Forces and other Government machinery.
By the time of General Templer's departure in May 1954, terrorist activity had steeply declined and the increasing flow of information about the terrorists given to the Security Forces reflected the renewal of public confidence. This progress continued under Sir Donald MacGillivray, who succeeded General Templer as High Commissioner, with Lieutenant-General Sir Geoffrey Bourne, and subsequently Lieutenant-General R. H. Bower, as Director of Operations.

On September 8th, 1955, an amnesty was declared by the Government which promised freedom from prosecution to any terrorists, or anyone who had consorted with the terrorists, if they surrendered. Every opportunity was given to terrorists to surrender; security forces called on terrorists to surrender when they were encountered and only fired if the terrorists refused to do so. Safe areas were demarcated so that terrorists could surrender in safety.

During the amnesty period in December, 1955, talks were held at Baling in North Malaya between the Chief Ministers of the Federation and Singapore, Tunku Abdul Rahman and Mr. Marshall, and Chin Peng, the Secretary General of the Malayan Communist Party. The talks failed because the terrorists demanded recognition of the Malayan Communist Party and no detention or investigation of those who surrendered. These demands were rejected by the Federation's Chief Minister.

At the end of September 1956 the number of Communist terrorists was fewer than 2,500 as compared with an estimated 8,000 in 1951.

In consequence of the agreement reached in London in February, 1956, at the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Conference, an Emergency Operations Council was established with Tunku Abdul Rahman, in his capacity as Minister for Internal Defence and Security, as Chairman. This Council replaced the former Director of Operations Committee which was responsible for advising the Director of Operations on various aspects of the conduct of operations against the Communist terrorists.

In terms of the London Agreement, the Forces required for the prosecution of the Emergency remain under the operational command of the Director of Operations and are used to aid the Government in giving effect to directions of the Emergency Operations Council made in pursuance of policy as laid down from time to time in Executive Council. The transfer to the Minister for Internal Defence and Security of the elected government of the responsibility for the general direction of Emergency Operations was the major reorganization of the direction of the campaign against the Communist terrorists in the first half of the year 1956.

Land Policy

The Torrens system of registration of title to land is in force in the Federation, except in the Settlements of Penang and Malacca where it is intended to introduce registration of title as soon as is practicable. Most alienated land is held in perpetuity on payment of an annual rent to Government. It is now the usual practice, however, to alienate town land on leases up to 99 years. Malay Reservations have been created within which land may not be alienated to non-Malays. State land, not lying within Malay Reservations, and Crown land may be alienated to Federal citizens and non-Federal citizens.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. All persons not resident in the Federation are chargeable at a flat rate of 30%. There is provision for relief for a non-resident British subject or a non-resident British protected person. In the case of individuals resident in the Federation, $3,000 is deductible from assessable income if the individual is unmarried. A further allowance of $2,000 is made to a married man. Allowances are also made in respect of children up to nine in number, for life assurance premiums paid, and for obligatory or contractual contributions to approved pension or provident funds. The rate of tax on the chargeable income remaining after the above-mentioned allowances have been made varies from 3% on the first $500 to 30% on chargeable income in excess of $50,000. The rate of tax chargeable on the income of companies was raised to 30% in 1951. A double taxation relief arrangement with the United Kingdom is in operation. The more important forms of indirect taxation are the import duty on tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, petrol, malt liquors, spirits and textiles; and the export duty on tin, tin-in-ore and rubber.

Public Finance

The nine State and two Settlement Governments have their own budgets, covering certain agreed items of revenue and expenditure; the Federal Government makes allocations to enable these budgets to be balanced. The figures given above represent the totals of Federal, State and Settlement revenue and expenditure in each year. The figures of revenue for 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1955 include contributions from Her Majesty's Government in aid of defence expenditure of $25,714,286 (£3,000,000), $3,385,714 (£395,000), $1,200,000 (£140,000), $2,046,033 (£238,703) and $1,910,350 (£222,874) respectively. The figure for 1955 also includes an interest free loan of $59,700,000 made jointly to the Governments of the Federation and Singapore by Her Majesty's Government for the War Damage Fund balanced by an equal sum entered under "Expenditure".

Approximately 67% of the Federal Revenue in 1955, exclusive of all contributions from Her Majesty's Government, was derived from Customs revenue and 13% from Income Tax. The main heads of Federal Expenditure as a charge on Revenue and General Revenue Balances in 1955 were as follows:

| Head                      | Amount (Malayan $ million) |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Allocation to State and Settlement Governments | 147.97                     |
| The Treasury              | 179.69                     |
| Emergency                 | 122.23                     |
| Defence and Internal Security | 89.38                  |
| Works                     | 48.64                      |
| Posts and Telecommunications | 25.89                |
| Home Affairs              | 15.46                      |
| Natural Resources         | 9.64                       |
| Health                    | 15.65                      |
| Chief Secretary           | 18.98                      |
| Education                 | 13.91                      |
but Health and Education are mainly the responsibility of State and Settlement Governments which spent a total of $36,200,000 on Health and $72,500,000 on Education in 1955.

The Public Debt of the Federation of Malaya on the 31st December, 1955, amounted to $506,617,000 (approximately $83 per head of population) as follows:

The value of the Sinking Funds at 31st December, 1955, was $111,386,850 and the Federation of Malaya's share of the Straits Settlements Public Debt was $11,900,000, and of the Straits Settlements Sinking Funds $8,979,460.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency notes issued by:
   (a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners.
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.
   (c) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation at 31st December, 1955, was $21,937,260.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August 1948. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1955, was $915,420,660, and of coins (other than silver) $34,919,960.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the $.

Development Plans

For the period 1950–55, the basis for development expenditure has been a six-year Draft Development Plan prepared in 1950. In 1954 a Mission from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development visited the Federation, and suggested, among its recommendations in its Report published in 1955, a detailed programme of development for the next five years. An Economic Committee of Executive Council served by a small Secretariat has been set up to prepare a Development Plan for the period 1956–60 in the light of the Bank Mission's Report and the constitutional changes that are expected to take place in the country. The latest figures of actual capital expenditure for the period 1950–55 are as follows:

| Service                  | $ million | Per cent |
|--------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Social Services          | 230       | 35·5     |
| Basic Services           | 363       | 56·0     |
| Productive Services      | 55        | 8·5      |
| **Total**                | **648**   | **100·0**|

**Social Services.**—15·1% of the total expenditure has been spent on the resettlement of squatters in New Villages, 3·6% on education facilities, 2·8% on medical and health, and 14·3% on housing.

**Basic Services.**—17·6% of the total expenditure has been on electricity, 12·9% on railways, 9% each on roads and telecommunications and 7·5% on water supplies.

**Productive Services.**—6·6% of the total expenditure has been spent on drainage and irrigation works, and 1·9% on agriculture generally.

The sources of funds have been:

(a) The Federation's territorial allocation of $21·7 million from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund;

(b) The Colonial Development Corporation which has so far provided $60·7 million towards the development of electric power;

(c) Loans raised by the Federation Government during the period amounting to $174·7 million;

(d) Revenue.

Education

There is a growing demand in Malaya for more and better education, but her plural society poses a special problem. The Federal Legislative Council has drawn up a new education plan, designed to contribute to the welding of the diverse communities into one Malayan nation. The new plan is aimed at extending primary education to every child in the country. Standard Primary Schools, with the national language as medium of instruction, will be established and Primary Schools of a similar type, but in which the language of instruction may be English, Tamil or Kuo Yu, will also be permitted. A national type of Secondary School with a common syllabus and common examination will be developed. In schools using Tamil or Mandarin as the medium, the teaching of Malay and English must be compulsory. Thus pupils at Chinese or Indian Primary Schools will have to be trilingual.

Under the present system schools are grouped according to the language which is used as the medium of instruction and not by nationality or race. Malay schools provide free primary education in Malay for the 6–12 years age group.
Chinese schools are usually provided and organized by Committees representing various Chinese communities. No age limit is imposed on pupils. Most of the Indian schools are provided by estates and run by the estate managers, Government grants-in-aid meeting the whole cost of the teachers' salaries and allowances. These estate schools are often single-teacher schools of 20 or 30 pupils.

The English schools are divided into two groups (a) schools maintained or aided by Government (aided schools are mostly Mission schools); and (b) private schools.

There are four Junior Technical (Trade) Schools in the Federation. The Technical College, Kuala Lumpur, has accommodation for 500 students and the College of Agriculture at Serdang forms the education branch of the Department of Agriculture. It provides a Malay and an English course.

The University of Malaya was established in 1949 as a result of the merger of Raffles College and the King Edward VII College of Medicine. It is organized in three faculties—Arts, Science and Medicine (including Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy). Government and other scholarships are also available for higher education abroad.

Normal classes for the training of teachers of English schools are run at several centres to supplement the output of the Teachers' Training Colleges at Kirkby and Brinsford Lodge in the United Kingdom, and Kota Bahru in Kelantan. These will be followed in the near future by one in Penang.

### Health

In 1955 Government maintained 71 hospitals with 12,667 beds; general 8,187, maternity 1,332 and infectious—including pulmonary tuberculosis—3,148. In addition, Government maintains five institutions with 3,369 beds for the treatment of leprosy and two mental hospitals of 4,200 beds. At Government hospitals the total number of in-patients admitted in 1955 was 246,237 (general 243,176, mental 2,325, and leprosy 736). On rubber estates there are 116 hospitals maintained privately with 5,294 beds; 86,948 in-patients were admitted during 1955. Treatment of the rural population is carried out through dispensaries (including static, mobile road and river boat units) and child health centres. These number 184, 77, 30 and 553 respectively, and the total number of new cases treated was 4,947,248.

The principal diseases treated in Government hospitals throughout the Federation were as follows:—Malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, dysentery, diarrhoea and enteritis, pneumonia, bronchitis, beri-beri, venereal diseases and enteric fever.

A full scale yaws eradication campaign was started in 1954 in the East Coast States of Kelantan and Trengganu with the help and advice of the World Health Organisation and supply of penicillin by UNICEF. Yaws is also present in certain areas on the West Coast, and an extension of the campaign to these areas is contemplated.

The main anti-malarial measures in towns and villages are sub-soil drainage by permanent works, oiling and D.D.T. spraying of houses. Water supplies are treated according to modern methods, and sanitation is either water-borne or by bucket system of removal in all the towns.

The total expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1955 was $51,675,865 compared with $16,623,487 in 1947.

### Communications

Kuala Lumpur became an International Airport with effect from 1st August 1956, and B.O.A.C. commenced a twice weekly service in and out of the Airport with effect from 15th August 1956.

About 1,830 route miles are covered by domestic air services. The Dakota fleet of Malayan Airways Limited serves the eight main aerodromes (Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Taiping, Penang, Alor Star, Kota Bahru, Kuantan and Malacca). In addition, the Federation Air Service provides air communications with the more remote places. This service is owned by Government and operated by the Malayan Railway, and it has a fleet of five DH Beaver aeroplanes. There are 44 landing grounds available to Beavers on scheduled or chartered services.

Malayan Airways, Ltd., amongst other services operated, run 34 services a week between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore; they also operate to Medan and Bangkok. The Union of Burma Airways and Thai Airways Ltd. operate between Penang and Rangoon and Penang and Bangkok respectively.

The route mileage of the Malayan Railway open to traffic in 1955 was 1,028. The main line runs from Singapore 488 miles north-westwards to Prai (opposite Penang Island); there are short branches to the west coast, and a longer branch (99 miles) from Bukit Mertajam northwards to the Thailand frontier at Padang Besar; the east coast line runs from Gemas (137 miles from Singapore) northwards 327 miles to Tumpat on the north-east coast of the peninsula.

### Libraries, Museums, etc.

There are museums in Kuala Lumpur and in Taiping, both of which have libraries, and new museums have been established in Malacca, Seremban and Penang. Under the Preservation of Books Ordinance, 1950, three copies of all publications printed in the Federation are required to be sent to the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur. The Malayan Historical Society, founded in 1953, is producing district and town histories and recording much information which would otherwise be lost. Archaeological research is conducted from the National Museum, and Anthropological research by the Department of Aborigines.
The Malayan Railway connects with the Thailand Railway at Padang Besar and Sungei Golok.

Passenger journeys in 1955 totalled 7,686,839 and revenue-earning goods tonnage 2,237,479. Gross revenue reached the record figure of $66.8 million; operating expenditure was $63.9 million.

The Public Works Department maintains about 6,384 miles of public road, of which 4,507 miles is metalled surface, grouted or sealed with bitumen, 190 metalled surface waterbound, 662 hard surface waterbound, 618 earth surface, 385 hard surface bitumen sealed, and 23 concrete surface.

The principal ports in the Federation are Penang and Port Swettenham: the numbers and net registered tonnages of ships of 75 tons and over which entered and cleared thereat during 1955 were:

| Port          | Entered | Cleared |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Penang        | 2,432   | 2,426   |
| Port Swettenham | 1,359   | 1,361   |

Tonnages of cargo (in "freight" tons) discharged and loaded, including cargo from and to ships of 75 tons and under were:

| Port          | Tonnage |
|---------------|---------|
| Penang        | 2,085,371 |
| Port Swettenham | 1,375,075 |

Navigational aids around the 800-mile coast are maintained by the Marine Department.

Services to and from the United Kingdom are provided by the main shipping companies on the Far Eastern service. Local companies provide coastal services to ports in South-East Asia.

Broadcasting

The Department of Broadcasting is pan-Malayan. It maintains stations of "Radio Malaya" at Kuala Lumpur (two 10 kW. medium wave transmitters, and one 5 kW. shortwave), Penang (two 2 kW. medium wave), Malacca (one 350 watt medium wave) and Ipoh (two unattended 2 kW. medium wave) but much of the Federation is served by the shortwave transmitters of "Radio Malaya", Singapore. There were 135,347 licence holders in the Federation on 31st December 1955, including 13,725 subscribers to Rediffusion (Malaya) Limited. Over 1,600 schools in the Federation are equipped with receivers for the reception of school broadcasts from Radio Malaya. Special rural broadcasts in Malay, Tamil, Mandarin and six other Chinese dialects are broadcast from the Federation transmitters. They are also heard on about 1,000 community receivers installed in rural areas by the Government and on receivers installed on several hundred mines and estates for the benefit of the workers.

Principal Occupations

There are approximately 1,000,000 self-employed persons and 1,000,000 wage-earners in the Federation. Of the self-employed persons some 250,000 are engaged in peasant agriculture (including rubber smallholdings) or fishing. Wage-earners are distributed as follows:

- Agriculture and Forestry (predominantly rubber estates and smallholdings): 429,000
- Mining: 44,000
- Manufacturing and Building Construction: 81,000
- Commerce and Finance: 107,000
- Communications and Services: 120,000
- Government and quasi-Government: 208,000

There are (as at 30th June, 1956) 240 registered trade unions of employers and employees, consisting of 137 Civil Servants' Unions, 96 Industrial Workers' Unions and seven Employers' Unions. Civil Servants' Unions have 65,246 members who are drawn from all races and from about 14 different types of Government occupations. Industrial Workers' Unions have 101,494 members drawn from about 15 different categories of employment. The seven Employers' Unions have a membership of 835; the Rubber and Tin Employers' Unions are the most important. The total membership is 167,575. An approximate break-down by races is 62% Indians, 16% Chinese, 20% Malays and 2% others.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are rubber, rice, oil palm, coconuts, pineapples and tea. There are 3½ million acres of land under rubber, more than half the area under all agricultural crops. Rubber small-holdings cover 1½ million acres. Total production in 1955 was 637,083 tons.

The livestock population numbers: cattle, including buffaloes 522,000, goats 268,000, sheep 27,000, pigs 404,000, equines 600.

The bulk of the commercial timber of Malaya is produced by the Dipterocarpaceae, but much timber is produced which is not at present of commercial value. The outturn of logs in 1955 was 1,107,000 tons of 50 cubic feet round, all of which were sawn locally. There is a flourishing export trade in graded sawn timber mainly to the United Kingdom and Australia, which totalled 109,000 tons in 1955; 39,000 tons of ungraded timber were exported, mainly to Mauritius, Aden and Indonesia.

The total production of fish per annum is now of the order of 168,600 tons, with a retail value of $165,500,000. Of this total, approximately 134,000 tons is produced in the Federation and 34,600 tons is landed in Singapore; 25,000 tons is from fresh water sources, mostly fishpond culture. $919,000 worth of the total fish production is used as manure and animal fodder. Approximately 21,700 tons of dried fish is produced in the Federation and exported through Singapore to many parts of Asia.

Mineral production during 1955 was as follows:

- Tin-in-concentrates: 61,244 tons
- Iron ore: 1,466,184 tons
- Coal: 206,118 tons
- Gold: 22,838 oz. (troy)
- Bauxite: 222,162 tons
- Ilmenite: 53,875 tons (exports)
- Columbite: 236 tons
- Wolfram: 56 tons
- Scheelite: 50 tons
- China clay: 1,378 tons

The Federation of Malaya was responsible for 34.7% of the world's total production of tin-in-concentrates and the value of her exports of tin metal and tin ore during 1955 was $432 million; other mineral exports (excluding gold) were valued at $42,837,828 (Malayan).

Manufactures include tyres and tubes, bricks (nearly 45 million in 1955), canvas/rubber and other footwear and soap (over 14,000 tons in 1955).

* Excluding bullion, specie and parcel post and trade between the Territories.

In 1947, 19·3% of total pan-Malayan imports came from the United Kingdom, 24·7% from other Commonwealth countries, 19·2% from Indonesia, and 36·8% from other foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1955 were, 18·1%, 17·5%, 30·1% and 34·3%.

In 1947, 16·1% of total pan-Malayan exports went to the United Kingdom, 19·7% to other Commonwealth countries, 33·9% to U.S.A., and 30·3% to other foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1955 were 18·3%, 18·8%, 17·4% and 45·5%.

About 40% of the Federation's import and export trade is channelled through Singapore. Trade with the United Kingdom has increased slightly. Commonwealth imports have also slightly increased since 1954. Imports from neighbouring territories have increased considerably since 1947, but have fallen from the peak of 1950-51 when rubber and tin were booming. Imports from Canada and the U.S.A., however, have remained about the same as in 1954.

The United States has continued to be one of the largest customers for Malayan exports. Exports to the United Kingdom are now slightly higher than those to the U.S.A. after having been lower immediately after the war. Exports to neighbouring territories have fluctuated with changing conditions, both economic and political.
