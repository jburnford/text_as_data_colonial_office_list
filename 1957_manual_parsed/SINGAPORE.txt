SINGAPORE

Area

The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islands, is 224.5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 31.5 square miles.

The area of Christmas Island is 64 square miles.

The Cocos-Keeling Islands, a group of 27 small coral islands with an area of five square miles, were transferred from the Colony of Singapore to Australia, with effect from 23rd November, 1955.

Population

The estimated population by race, as on 30th June 1956, was:

|                | Singapore Island | Christmas Island |

|                | 1,261,677        | 2,432           |

The population of Singapore City, the seat of Government, is about 896,800

Geographical Features

The highest point on Singapore Island is 581 feet above sea level. The island's river system has been considerably modified by artificial means. Forest and Nature Reserves, including mangrove swamps, total about 15 square miles.

The greater part of Christmas Island is a central plateau 600-700 feet above sea level, rising to low hills up to 1,170 feet. Most of the island is densely wooded; it contains extensive deposits of mixed phosphates. The island lies about 190 nautical miles south of the western extremity of Java.

Climate of Singapore

There are no well-defined dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is 87°, the mean minimum 74°; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

History

A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the Imperial Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was recovered on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, and was constituted a separate Colony.

The Malayan Emergency has had its inevitable effect on Singapore, and in 1955 the essential security powers of the Emergency Regulations were carried forward, with substantial improvement, into legislation to last for a period of three years.

Christmas Island was discovered and named by Capt. William Mynors of the Royal Mary in 1643. The earliest recorded landing is that of a party sent ashore by William Dampier in 1688. The first official attempts at exploration were made by men landed from British ships in 1857 and 1887. Some of the geological specimens brought back were found to be almost pure samples of phosphate of lime and the British Government was moved to annex the island in June 1888, placing it under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Straits Settlements. By 1897 the Christmas Island Phosphate Company had been formed. In 1949 the Company's undertaking was purchased by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand, on whose behalf the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission was established. In recent years production has been about 350,000 tons annually.
Constitution

Singapore now has a large measure of internal self-government under the Order-in-Council which came into force on February 8th, 1955, and which follows the general pattern of the recommendations of the Rendel Constitutional Commission Report published on February 22nd 1954. The form of Government is a Council of Ministers responsible to a Legislative Assembly of predominantly elected membership.

The Constitution provides for a Council of Ministers consisting of the Governor, as President, three ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), and seven Ministers appointed from among the Elected and Nominated Members of the Legislative Assembly, provided that there shall not at any one time be more than one Minister who is a Nominated Member of the Legislative Assembly. One of the unofficial Ministers is entitled "Chief Minister". Subject only to the Governor's reserved powers, which would only be used in extreme cases where in his opinion public faith, public order or good government appeared to be impaired, the Council of Ministers controls Government policy in all matters except external affairs, internal security and defence. Ministers are collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly for policy but have full executive authority over their respective departments, each of which has a Permanent Secretary, a Civil Servant, who exercises supervision under the general direction of the Minister. The portfolios allocated to unofficial Ministers are: Commerce and Industry; Health; Education; Labour and Welfare; Local Government, Lands and Housing; and Communications and Works. At the present time the Council of Ministers has only six unofficial members and the Chief Minister holds the portfolio of Labour and Welfare.

The Legislative Assembly consists of the Speaker, three ex officio members, four nominated unofficial members and twenty-five elected members. It met for the first time on the 25th April, 1955.

On September 22nd, 1951, the Municipality received the Royal Charter conferring on Singapore the status of a City. The Municipal Council of Singapore is now the City Council of Singapore and the Municipal Commissioners are now City Councillors. The City Council is presided over by a President who is a permanent civil servant. It consists of 27 Unofficial Members, 18 of whom are elected on a franchise similar to that for the Legislative Council, and nine are nominated by the Governor. The rural areas of Singapore are administered by the Rural Board all of whose members are nominated. In addition the rural area is divided into seven Rural Districts each of which has a Rural District Council of nominated unofficials.

A Committee on Local Government has recommended the creation of a system of local government continuing the City Council (with the public utilities of water, gas and electricity transferred to separate Boards) and setting up three and, eventually four, Rural Districts, adapted to the three new towns proposed in the Master Plan published in January, 1956.

Land Policy

From the foundation of the Settlement of Singapore there has never been any restriction on the alienation of land to non-natives. Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas are in process of acquisition for public purposes, particularly housing.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the Colony or received in the Colony from outside. Companies are chargeable at 30% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 3% on the first $500 of chargeable income and rising to 30% on incomes exceeding $50,000. Non-resident individuals are charged from 20% to 30%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. A double taxation arrangement with the United Kingdom is in force.

Public Finance

| Year       | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |

In 1955, 36·09% of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 39·30% from Income and other taxes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Administration—general 11·54%
- Social Services 31·40%
- Judicial, Police and Prisons 13·76%
- Postal Services and Telecommunications 6·57%
- Public Works 5·69%
- Miscellaneous Services 31·04%

The Public Debt of the Colony of Singapore at the 31st December 1955 amounted to $115 million or approximately $93·00 per head of the population. The Public Debt comprises:

- (a) S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72: $30 million
- (b) S.S. 3% War Loan, 1953–59: $25 million
- (c) S.S. 3% War Loan, 1953–60: $10 million
- (d) Singapore 3% Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70: $50 million

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
   - (a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners;
   - (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya;
   - (c) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.
(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August, 1948.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December, 1955, was $21,937,260·45.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1955, was $915,420,659·60 and coins (other than silver) $34,919,960·33.

Development Plans

Development still proceeds on the general lines of the original Plan prepared in 1950, though adjustments have been made to meet changed needs and circumstances.

During 1954 the Development Plans were examined by a Mission sent to Malaya by the International Bank. Their report was made available to Government in May 1955 and it was published in September 1955. The Report generally commended the lines of development that were being followed, but proposed some modifications in the sums of expenditure. About $120 millions was actually spent on development in 1955, of which capital expenditure by Government accounted for $44 millions and it was expected that roughly the same amounts would be spent in 1956.

Development expenditure is financed from the Development Fund which has been augmented annually by a contribution of $20 millions from revenue. At the end of 1955 the money in this Fund amounted to $29·4 millions, and it was expected that at the end of 1956 there would still be at least $11 millions available in it.

The new Singapore Airport was opened for traffic in August 1955, but it is intended that work on the permanent Terminal Building should commence in 1957 for completion in 1958. The final cost of the whole scheme will be not less than $46 millions, or more than £5 millions, of which $10 millions will have been contributed from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

Construction of the Urban Health Centre, which is being entirely financed from Colonial Development and Welfare money, was begun at the end of 1955 and should be completed early in 1957. The new Dry Dock, named The Queen's Dock, was completed in 1956. The cost of this Dock together with a fitting-out berth was over $9 millions.

A large scale development recently completed is the new bridge over the Kalling River and the Nicoll Highway which provide a magnificent route from the city to the eastern suburbs, and which has already shown its ability to reduce traffic congestion even at rush hours. The total expenditure involved has been over $13 millions, of which the bridge itself will have cost $7 millions.

The City Council has proceeded vigorously with its plans to improve the supply of power and water to the island. The large modern Power Station at Pasir Panjang is not yet complete, but plans are already in hand for further extensions. The supply of water is more than keeping pace with the rapidly increasing population, but there are ambitious plans in readiness to cover all possible requirements over the next 20 years or more.

Education

The education system of the Colony provides education for some 236,541 pupils in 623 regular schools. The University of Malaya has 990 men and 230 women students of whom 796 are from outside the Colony. The Teachers' Training College provides courses for 1,089 men and 737 women students, the majority of these being on part-time courses while working as Teachers-in-Training in Primary Schools. There are 673 students in Junior Technical Schools. In addition there are 10,200 students enrolled in Adult Classes aided by Government. Of the pupils in regular schools, 111,974 are taught in English, 110,468 in Chinese, and 14,099 in the vernacular languages (Malay and Tamil). There are 7,773 teachers employed, 48% of them being trained. Of the school pupils, approximately 14% are in secondary classes. The Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Department Estimates before their submission to Government.

The net cost of education in 1955 was $37·7 millions (capital expenditure $8·2 millions). The comparative figures for 1947 of $3·38 millions (capital expenditure $0·22 millions) indicate the vast increase in cost due to the implementation of the Colony's Development Programme in education.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Raffles Library contains about 100,000 volumes, including a large and important collection of books on Malaya. There are three part-time branches. Books for children are provided at each library, and there is a separate children's library at the Main Library. Although small membership subscriptions are payable the library is financed mainly by the Colony Government. It functions as a national library in that it contains the Colony's archives and the books and other publications which are printed in Singapore and deposited under the terms of the Printers and Publishers Ordinance.

The Raffles Museum has departments of zoology, ethnography and archaeology of the Malayan region, and of the history of Singapore and Malaya. It publishes the Bulletin of the Raffles Museum (devoted to papers on zoology), and the Memoirs of the Raffles Museum (devoted to papers on local history and anthropology). In conjunction with the Museum Department Federation of Malaya, it also publishes a series of popular pamphlets on museum subjects.

The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, closely associated with the Raffles Museum, publishes a quarterly journal devoted mainly to shorter papers on history, archaeology and ethnography.

Health

The Government Medical Department provides some 5,800 beds in its eight hospitals and Leprosy Settlement of which some 2,000 are available for the treatment of acute disease. There are eight static dispensaries, four travelling dispensaries and two floating dispensaries to serve general cases among the population of over 310,000 in the rural areas, and a chain of 48 centres where the Government maternity and child welfare division operates in addition. A school medical and dental service and a quarantine service are working on a steadily expanding basis.
A ten-year Medical Plan is in operation to double all the existing services and provide adequate service for the whole population by 1960; and a well-appointed Nurses' Home, for 250 nurses, a new outpatients' division, with a modern blood-transfusion unit at the Civil General Hospital of 1,100 beds, and four rural health centres were completed and opened in 1955. Work on improvements and extensions to the Maternity Hospital covering both accommodation and teaching facilities is nearing completion. Under the Plan the Tuberculosis Hospital will be built up to 1,700 beds from the present 500 beds. The Venereal Diseases campaign is conducted on most up-to-date lines with a special hospital, clinics, a travelling dispensary and a follow-up visiting scheme.

In the field of tuberculosis, out-door treatment is provided at a clinic and domiciliary relief and assistance by the Almoners' Department is rapidly expanding; a B.C.G. campaign was successfully started in 1951. Some 22,500 cases of tuberculosis have passed through this centre since 1946 and the number of out-patients in regular attendance is over 10,000. This problem remains one of the most urgent, however, and plans for more beds and a Chest Unit are in hand. The Royal Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association with its own clinic and treatment centre gives most valuable co-operation to the Government. This Association is also greatly extending the scope of its service, particularly in rehabilitation. The Tuberculosis Treatment Allowance Scheme is operated by the Department of Social Welfare. The payment under this scheme is restricted to patients whose prognosis is good and who are likely to be returned to their former working capacity within a reasonable space of time.

Main hospital out-patient attendances, which were under 100,000 per annum before the war, have risen to over 700,000; yearly attendances at rural and maternity clinics have risen from 85,000 to 240,000. Homes visited by nurses now total 35,244 and by midwives 55,844. An attempt is made to see all rural births, while the Maternity Hospital deals with some 25,322 maternity cases yearly or over 40% of the total births of the Colony. In-patients in the main acute hospitals total over 60,000 per annum, compared with 26,000 before the war. Leprosy services are being rapidly modernized and some 1,500 patients are under treatment or observation.

There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualifications of M.B. and B.S., registrable in the United Kingdom, can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery), also registrable in the United Kingdom, the Diploma of Pharmacy and the Diploma of the Royal Sanitary Institute. A complete course for nurses is in operation and the local qualification is now registrable in England and Wales. The Diploma in Public Health granted by the University is recognized by the General Medical Council.

Statutory Boards cover all medical, nursing, dental and pharmacy activities, and there is a Hospitals Board.

Health figures for the Colony continue to improve. Although the population is increasing by some 40,000 a year through natural means the death rate decreased from 19·51 in 1939 to 8·63 in 1955. The infantile death rate fell from 130·4 per thousand in 1939 to 49·69 in 1955. With no outbreak of any of the major infectious diseases, Singapore remains one of the healthiest city ports in the Far East. The birth rate at 48·86 continues to be one of the highest in the world. This has resulted in a very young population with its special and peculiar problems.

All the usual special Departments such as eye, ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics, are included in the hospital services. Physiotherapists, almoners, health visitors and occupational therapists are employed on an expanding scale. Treatment of mental disease is based on one of the largest institutions in the East and here all the modern forms of treatment can be obtained.

The Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1955 amounted to $29·9 million compared with $6·3 million in 1947.

Communications

Air—Singapore Airport, seven and a half miles from the city centre, is an international airport, and one of the largest in South-East Asia. It has a runway of 8,000 feet in length, and a completely up-to-date approach and runway lighting system. The Regional Air Traffic Control Centre based at Singapore Airport controls all flights within the confines of its 750,000 square miles Flight Information Region.

Major external international passenger, airmail and cargo services operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways Sydney–London
- British Overseas Airways Corporation London–Sydney
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines Amsterdam–Djakarta
- Pan American Airways San Francisco–Singapore
- Cathay Pacific Airways Hong Kong–Singapore
- Thai Airways Bangkok–Singapore
- Garuda Indonesian Airways Medan–Singapore
- Air-India International Bombay–Singapore
- Union of Burma Airways Rangoon–Singapore

Malayan Airways Limited operate daily domestic flights to all important points in the Federation of Malaya with regular scheduled services to North Borneo and Sarawak.

Road—The Public Works Department maintains 254·47 miles of bituminous roads in the City and Rural areas. The City Engineer maintains 181 miles of roads in the City area.

Rail—The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge. The Railway enters the Colony at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

Water—The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western
Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers and other Colony waters.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu, under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin, on behalf of the Singapore Government. The Chairman and members of the Board are appointed by the Governor.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Length | Water depth |
|--------|-------------|
| West Wharf | 4,525 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| Empire Dock (24½ acres) | 3,522 ft. 27 ft. and over |
| Main Wharf | 3,152 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| East Wharf | 700 ft. 24 ft. |
| North Wall, Empire Dock | 940 ft. 12 ft. |

In 1955 cargo handled by the wharves totalled 5,661,609 tons. The number of vessels accommodated alongside the wharves in 1955 was 3,573, net registered tonnage being 10,742,498.

The Board maintains tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships; also lighters, a fleet of steel barges and a salvage tug with a range of 3,000 miles.

The Board has first-class facilities for dry docking and repairing ships of all sizes. There are six dry docks, the largest of these being King’s Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons gross. Repair berths total 3,000 feet in length.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, the U.S.A., South America, South and East Africa and the various countries in Asia. Several coasting lines are engaged in conveying transit cargo to and from Thailand, Indonesia, Borneo, Sarawak, Malayan ports and Cambodia.

Broadcasting

Radio Malaya is operated on a pan-Malayan basis by the Department of Broadcasting for the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. Programmes in English, Chinese (seven dialects), Malay and Tamil are broadcast over three networks. The total number of hours of broadcasting is 240 per week, of which over 24 hours are occupied by broadcasts to Schools in English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil.

In Singapore the Department has studios and offices at Caldecott Hill. The main transmitting Station is at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the City, where four short wave transmitters of average power 5 kW. and three medium wave transmitters of average power 10 kW. are situated.

In the Federation of Malaya studios and offices are maintained at Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca. V.H.F. equipment has now been installed and these stations are fully integrated with the Singapore programmes.

The number of broadcast listening station licences in Singapore at the end of 1955 was 49,424.

A commercial company operates a wired broadcasting service in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Penang under Government licence, to which there were 34,066 subscribers in Singapore at 31st December, 1955.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief industries are: transport and communications (including port and lightage) 60,000, commerce and finance 103,000, light industries 105,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 32,000, public administration (central Government, Defence Services and Local Authorities) 61,000. There are 256 registered trade unions, having a membership of 157,638.

Main Products

The small area of agricultural land is used mainly to produce food crops for local consumption. Poultry-rearing as a rural industry is thriving and 7 million head are kept. This is more than sufficient for local consumption and allows some to be exported. In addition the production of pigs is considerable (about 220,000) but other livestock are relatively few.

Manufactures comprise a wide range of light industries. The traditional concentration on processing of primary products such as rubber, tin, sago, rattan, and the provision of shipbuilding, docking and ship repairing facilities, light engineering works and motor assembly plants has been supplemented in recent years by a growing range of consumer goods such as dry cell batteries, glass products, edible oils, soap, perfumes, paper products, poultry food, paint, metal boxes, shoe polish, rope, biscuits and confectionery, and pencils.

The huge long-term building programmes are also materially assisting construction industries such as brick and tile making, cement block manufacturing, sawmilling, metal window-frame works and makers of furniture and fixtures. Construction of a steel-rolling mill has been completed and production of mild steel bars similar in quality to British products has commenced.

There is extensive fishing in local waters, but the catch is insufficient to meet the demand and is supplemented by imports. In consequence, Government is giving every encouragement to the development of offshore fisheries.

Trade

Singapore handles the major proportion of the imports and exports of the Federation of Malaya. In addition much of the external trade of her more immediate neighbours passes through her hands. The chief exports are rubber, tin, timber, petroleum products, copra, canned pineapples, coconut oil and spices. A wide range of manufactured consumer and capital goods is also imported for local consumption and for re-export.

(See Federation of Malaya for statistics of pan-Malayan trade—page 136.)

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. The Pineapple Joint Industrial Council is concerned with the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruits, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.
In 1956, the Singapore Government created a separate Co-operative Development Division with its own Registrar who is responsible to the Minister for Commerce and Industry.

There were 70 Societies on the register on 31st December, 1955, made up of 34 Thrift and Loan Societies, 18 Thrift and Investment Societies, 4 Credit Societies, 2 Rural Credit Societies, 4 Stores and Shop Societies, 5 Marketing Societies, 1 Housing Society, 1 Agencies and Conveyance Society and 1 Union. Total membership 27,441, working capital $9,088,642 and Reserve Fund $282,083.
