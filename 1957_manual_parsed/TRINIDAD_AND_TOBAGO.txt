TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

Area

The total area of the Colony is 1,980 square miles (Trinidad 1,864, Tobago 116).

Population

This was estimated to number 720,450 at the end of 1955. The majority are natives of the West Indies, of African and East Indian descent. The racial groups at the 1946 census were: African 47%, East Indian 35%, Mixed or Coloured 14%, European 3%, Chinese 1%. English is spoken generally throughout the Colony.

Geographical Features

Trinidad is traversed by two mountain ranges, the northern and southern ranges, running roughly east and west, and a third, the central range, running diagonally across the island. Between the northern and central ranges the land is flat and well-watered; south of the central range it is undulating and the water supply poor. Apart from a comparatively small area in the northern range (main peaks: Cerro del Aripo 3,085 feet, El Tucuche 3,072 feet) and Mount Tamana (1,009 feet) in the central range, all the land is below 1,000 feet. The rivers, though numerous, are unimportant. A main ridge of hills, 18 miles in length, extends nearly two-thirds of the length of Tobago from its north-eastern extremity. The highest point is 1,890 feet. About 300,000 acres (or 22%) of the total area of the Colony is under forest.

Climate

The climate is tropical. There is a dry season from January to the middle of May with an average rainfall of 1·6–3·5 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December (with a short break in September) with an average of 4·9–12·5 inches per month. The average annual rainfall ranges from 77 inches in the west to 86 inches in the east. The mean temperature in 1955, was 83·5°. The coolest months of the year are December to April.

History

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on his third voyage in 1498 and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalized his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of representations made to the Court of Madrid as to its exceptional fertility, a royal proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to Catholics of all nations to settle in Trinidad. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, soon augmented by many French families driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the events of the French Revolution; and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

In 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces. In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

Tobago was also discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the Darling and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when some 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of a year or two these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James, Duke of Courland,
obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsius procured letters patent from Louis XIV creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral D'Estrées to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis XIV restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1682, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral, the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to Great Britain in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In 1793, it was captured by a British force and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802; again reconquered in 1803 by a British force; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad in 1888 and in 1898 became a ward of the united colony of Trinidad and Tobago.

**Constitution**

The new constitution of 1956 provides for a unicameral Legislature with an elected majority, a Chief Minister, a Minister of Finance and an elected Speaker to preside over the Council. In addition, it provides for the appointment of a Public Service Commission and a separate Police Service Commission and Police Promotions Board. The Executive Council is the chief instrument of policy and, with certain exceptions, the Governor is required to consult with it in the exercise of his powers and to act in accordance with its advice.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor as Chairman, a Chief Minister, two *ex officio* members (Colonial Secretary and Attorney General) and seven members elected by the Legislative Council. The election of the Chief Minister or any other of the last-named members may be revoked by a two-thirds vote of the Legislative Council. The Governor, on the advice of the Chief Minister, may charge elected members of the Executive Council with the administration of any government department or subject (other than the subject of finance which he is required to assign to an elected member) which, in his discretion, he has declared may be assigned to elected members. Those so appointed are styled "Ministers".

The Legislative Council consists of an elected Speaker, a Chief Minister, two *ex officio* members (Colonial Secretary and Attorney General) five nominated members and twenty-four elected members, including the Chief Minister and the Speaker (if elected from the Council). In the present Executive Council the eight elected members have been charged with the administration of Finance, Planning and Development (Chief Minister); Agriculture, Lands and Fisheries; Communications, Works and Public Utilities; Education and Culture; Health and Social Services; Housing and Local Government; Labour; and Industry, Commerce and Tourism.

Adult suffrage was introduced in 1946. The first general election under the 1956 constitution was held on 24th September, 1956, and 80% out of a total electorate of 338,225 voted.

**Land Policy**

Policy with regard to land in the Colony was modified in 1941 when the sale of Crown lands was discontinued. Leases are now granted with covenants designed to assure full and proper development of the land. The period for which leases for agricultural purposes are granted is 25 years, with an option to renew for a further 25 years. The leases also contain provision for compensating the lessees for unexhausted improvements, and for penalties for dilapidation of Government-owned buildings. Individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives. A small amount of Crown land is acquired mainly for public purposes.

**Taxation**

Taxation takes the form under the Customs tariff of specific and *ad valorem* duties, with British preferential and general tariff rates. There is an export duty on asphalt of $1.20 per ton (crude) and $1.66 per ton (refined). The excise duty on rum is $6.00 per gallon and on petrol 9 cents per gallon. Under an Income Tax Ordinance, the first $1,200 of an individual's income is free of tax, and then for the first additional $1,000 the rate is 6 cents for every $, but this rate is increased for every additional $1,000. A personal allowance of $480 is made for a wife and $240 for each child in the Colony and the amount actually expended for education, board and lodging (not exceeding $1,200) for each child educated outside the Colony. The rate for life assurance companies is 15% and for other companies 40%. Other main heads of taxation include estate duties, lands and buildings taxes, a sweepstake tax and a cinema entertainment tax.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 13,445,000  | 12,230,000      |
| 1951 | 59,187,000  | 52,869,000      |
| 1952 | 66,785,000  | 62,489,000      |
| 1953 | 68,100,681  | 66,609,901      |
| 1954 | 73,634,817  | 73,740,476      |
| 1955 | 81,943,618  | 79,347,280      |

It was estimated in 1955 that 32% ($26.1 million) of revenue was derived from Customs and excise and 38% ($31 million) from tax on incomes.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Public Debt $5.1 million; social services (including health, education and old age pensions) $20.4 million; works and hydraulics extraordinary and annually recurrent $9.5 million; railways and telegraphs $2.2 million; subventions $7.6 million; and police $5 million.
The Public Debt at the end of 1955 amounted to $73·1 million ($101·32 per capita) of which $12·6 million was issued locally and $60·5 million in the United Kingdom. The Colony's surplus balances at 31st December, 1955 stood at $42·3 million.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) on behalf of Barbados, British Guiana, Leeward Islands, Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. It consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100 and United Kingdom silver and bronze coins. (The British Caribbean currency notes replaced Barbados, British Guiana and Trinidad Government and Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) currency notes in August 1951.) Total currency in circulation in Trinidad at the end of 1955 amounted to $38·3 million. The B.W.I.$4·80 = £1 sterling.

Development Plans

Trinidad and Tobago received an allocation of $4,800,000 under the Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a development plan.

In 1950 the Government approved a programme of capital development to be executed during the period 1951–55 at an estimated cost of $35,985,275. The latest revised estimated cost of this programme which came to an end on the 31st December, 1955, was $67,704,476 of which $41,698,720 was spent from the following sources during the life of the programme:

| Source                                      | Cost       |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| (i) Loans Funds: Ordinance No. 11/51        | $20,639,179|
| (ii) Surplus Balances                        | $8,804,780 |
| (iii) Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes | $2,265,995 |
| (iv) Advances pending the raising of a loan under Electricity Loan Ordinance No. 4 of 1954 | $9,988,766 |

$41,698,720

This programme has largely achieved its objectives and the Government proposes to embark on another Five Year Economic Programme of further capital expenditure during the period 1956–1960.

The emphasis of the original plan has been on:

(a) provision of a basic framework for economic development in terms of water, electricity, roads;

(b) extended medical services to improve the health of the community; and

(c) improved educational facilities.

Other Development

The Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance, 1950, provides for the granting of specific reliefs from Customs duty and income tax to persons establishing new industries in the Colony. In 1951 the Rugby Portland Cement Company Limited, in association with the Colonial Development Corporation, set up the Trinidad Cement Company Limited, with a capital of $8,000,000, to undertake the manufacture of cement. During 1954 the following were declared "Pioneer Industries":

Assembly and/or construction of sea-going craft; macaroni products; manufacture of building materials from a combination of bagasse and asphalt; manufacture of upholstery for motor vehicles and of textile and/or plastic covers, bags and containers; manufacture of paper bags; manufacture of plain and corrugated cardboard and gummed paper tapes; manufacture of tin-plate containers; manufacture of batteries; assembly of electricity meters; manufacture of drinking straws.

During 1955 there were eight additional "Pioneer Industries", namely:

Manufacture of vitaminized food from bananas; dyeing of natural and synthetic materials; manufacture of coconut coir fibre rubberized mattresses and mats; manufacture of dried yeast, manufacture of wire nails and staples; manufacture of pulp, paper, boards and packaging material; manufacture of gin; manufacture of air-conditioning equipment.

Education

Primary education in the Colony is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 15 resident within two miles of a Government or assisted school. No pupil is retained on the roll of a primary school after attaining the age of 15. Secondary schools prepare pupils for the Cambridge school certificate and higher school certificate examinations. On the results of the latter, five university scholarships are awarded annually by Government.

On the 31st December, 1955 there were 388 primary and intermediate schools (65 Government primary, two Government intermediate, 315 assisted primary, and six assisted intermediate) with a total enrolment of 146,716 (28,616 Government and 118,100 assisted). There were also 8,306 pupils enrolled in 162 private primary schools.

There were 34 secondary schools (two Government, 12 assisted and 20 private) with a total enrolment of 12,698 (764 Government, including 131 students attending the technical institute, 6,471 assisted and 5,463 private). A Board of Industrial Training maintains a full-time technical school and conducts evening classes at seven different centres. Comprehensive in-service training in well-equipped schools and workshops is also carried out by the larger oil companies. A Government Technical College at San Fernando was opened during 1954. The Department of Education conducts evening classes for adults and the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies (situated in Jamaica) provides a programme of classes at an intermediate university level. There were over 655 students from the Colony studying at universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Jamaica. Net expenditure on education (including school buildings) was $9,140,428 in 1955 as compared with $956,000 in 1938.

Libraries

Government has in recent years substantially increased the provision made for public library services. The Central Library of Trinidad and Tobago has headquarters in Port of Spain, regional branches at San Fernando and Scarborough and several other branch libraries. There is also a Trinidad Public (Free) Library at Port of Spain and a Carnegie Free Library at San Fernando. In 1955 over 400,000 books were circulated through libraries.
Health

There are three general hospitals, a mental, a leprosy, a venereal diseases, and a tuberculosis hospital, eight district hospitals and a tuberculosis sanatorium, a leprosarium and two houses of refuge, with a total of 3,753 beds. In 1955 the daily average number of beds occupied in Port of Spain and San Fernando Hospitals was 1,007 and the total number of patients treated 51,229. Health centres and rural dispensaries are maintained in the townships and in the larger villages. A public health programme is administered through the following divisions and units: malaria, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, yaws, hookworm, nutrition, health education, maternity and infant welfare. The principal causes of death during 1955 were (apart from old age):—diseases of early infancy; heart diseases—chronic, rheumatic, arteriosclerotic and degenerative, etc.; vascular lesions affecting central nervous system; malignant neoplasms (cancer); gastro-enteritis and colitis; bronchitis and tuberculosis of the respiratory system.

The expenditure by the Health Department in 1955 was $9,182,101 compared with $1,000,000 in 1938.

Communications

The main airfields are at Piarco, 12 miles from Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Crown Point (Tobago). Ten airlines (British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Aerovias Brasil, Aerolineas Argentinas, Trans-Canada Airlines, St. Vincent Government Air Service, Air France and British Overseas Airways Corporation) maintain scheduled operations through Piarco. British West Indian Airways provides daily communication between Trinidad and Tobago. In 1955 at Piarco there were 13,970 aircraft movements; 78,399 passengers arrived and 1,513,200 lb. of mail and cargo were unladen. A meteorological station is maintained by the British Caribbean Meteorological Service at Piarco.

There are 108 miles of Government railway. In 1955 over 3,223,300 passengers and 434,000 tons of goods were carried. The ancillary services of the Trinidad Government were terminated on 31st March, 1954, and handed over to private enterprise.

There are 3,898 miles of roads; 2,677 miles suitable for wheeled traffic, 1,220 miles of bridle roads.

Trinidad is well served by steamship lines; these include the Alcoa, American President, American Pioneer, American Republics, Argentine Staff, Blue Star, Booth, Canadian National, Cunard White Star, Elders and Fyffes, French, Furness, Harrison, Louis Dreyfus, Moore-McCormack, New Zealand, Norgeuf, Nourse, Royal Mail, Royal Netherlands, Saguenay Terminals, Surinam, and Venezuelan lines. During 1955, 5,023 ships entered the harbour with a total tonnage of 13,316,000 while 4,966 ships cleared harbour with a total tonnage of 13,665,000.

The Government coastal steamers maintain regular weekly services between Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Scarborough (Tobago).

Broadcasting

The Trinidad Broadcasting Company Limited operates "Radio Trinidad" on the following frequencies:

- 790 kc/s. (379.7 metres).
- 6,085 kc/s. (49.3 metres).
- 3,275 kc/s. (91.6 metres).

The two 500w. transmitters are situated at Caroni. On 30th June 1956, 21,168 receiving licences were held, with an estimated seven listeners per receiver.

Radio Distribution (Trinidad) Limited operates a wired broadcasting service from Port of Spain to Tunapuna and in San Fernando. The service offers two programmes one of which consists of a relay of the "Radio Trinidad" transmissions.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is dependent on agriculture. A rough estimate of the numbers in the main occupations is: agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting 76,600; mining and quarrying 11,700; manufacturing 46,900; construction and electricity, gas, water supply and sanitary services 23,700; commerce 33,800; transport, storage and communications 17,800; government, community and business, and personal and recreative services 54,000.

In December, 1955, there were 50 workers' unions with a membership of 45,000 and twelve unions of employers.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are sugar and by-products (molasses and rum), cocoa, coconuts and coconut products, citrus and by-products, rubber, coffee, tonka beans and bananas. Ground provisions, maize and rice are also grown for local consumption. Copra is now mostly processed locally into edible oil, coconut oil, lard compound, margarine, butter substitute and laundry soap.

The estimated livestock population in 1955 was as follows: cattle 40,000; water buffaloes 4,500; goats 35,000; sheep 5,000; swine 50,000; horses 500; mules 1,000; donkeys 500; and poultry 2,000,000 (this total fluctuates).

The outturn of timber and fuel from the forest in 1955 was 5,351,700 cubic feet. There were 87 licensed sawmills.

There is extensive fishing in coastal waters but the catch is insufficient to meet demand. Experiments are being carried out in fishpond culture.

Crude petroleum and natural gas are produced in the southern part of Trinidad. Foreign crude oil is also imported from Venezuela, the refined products being re-exported. The (asphalt) "Pitch Lake", 109 acres in extent, is at La Brea; 136,729 tons of natural asphalt were produced in 1955.

In addition to the two main industries of oil and sugar, the island is the world's only supplier of Angostura bitters. Its manufactures also include bricks and tiles, paint, cement, shirts, pyjamas, shoes, boots, furniture, soap, matches, cigarettes, beer, aerated waters, biscuits, chocolate, confectionery, ice, stock feed, glass, time recording clocks and equipment, bay rum, drugs and industrial gases. Printing, foundry work, ship and aircraft repair are also carried on.

**Co-operative and Marketing Organizations**

A statutory Marketing Board is charged with assisting and improving the marketing and processing of agricultural and fishery produce in the interests of producers and in particular with assisting co-operative societies to dispose of their produce to the best advantage. The Board also controls the export of *gros michel* bananas. The other agricultural products are marketed mainly through producer associations within the framework of agreements such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, (Coconut) Oil and Fats Agreement, or through normal commercial channels, e.g. rum, bitters, coffee.

In 1955 there were 418 agricultural credit societies with a membership of 16,000; 63 co-operative societies with 6,500 members and total assets $5,000,000; 250 credit unions with over 22,000 members and total assets $2 million; and 320 friendly societies with 146,000 members and liquid and invested funds amounting to $2,000,000.
