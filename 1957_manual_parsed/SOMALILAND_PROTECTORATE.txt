SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE

Area
The Protectorate extends along part of the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden and is 68,000 square miles in area.

Population
No complete census has yet been possible but the mainly nomadic Somali population is estimated to be 640,000. The non-indigenous element of the population is small. It consists of European and Indian officials of the Government, one or two European representatives of commercial houses in Aden and a few Indian and Arab traders.

Principal Towns
The capital is Hargeisa—population about 40,000; Burao has about 10,000, Berbera, the principal port, about 7,500. The population of these towns varies considerably at different times of the year.

Geographical Features
The country consists of four main features—the coastal plain, the maritime plain (both known as the Guban), the escarpment, rising in parts to 6,000 and 7,000 feet (the Golis), and a gently sloping plain or plateau to the south (the Ogo). The Haud, the empty waterless plains, the greater part of which lie to the south of the Protectorate frontier, constitute the principal pastures of the country.

Climate
Except for the intense heat of the coast, with an irritating dust-laden wind which also occurs in a few inland areas during the south-west monsoon from May to September, the climate is healthy and pleasant.

The temperature varies from 70°–108°F in the coastal areas, and in the highlands from occasional slight local frosts (32°F) to between 80°F and 99°F. The rainfall varies from an average of 2 inches at Berbera on the coast, 5 inches at Burao and 15 inches at Hargeisa, to as much as 50 inches in the higher mountains of Erigavo and Borama Districts.

History
The first British treaty with a Somali tribe was signed in 1827 after a British ship had been attacked off Berbera, its cargo plundered and a number of its crew murdered. In 1840 various further treaties were concluded with the Sultan of Tajura and the Governor of Zeilah with the object of affording unrestricted harbouring facilities for ships of the East India Company.

In 1875 the Khedive of Egypt claimed jurisdiction over the entire Somali coast as far as Cape Guardafui, but in 1884, during the Mahdi revolt in the Sudan, Egyptian garrisons were withdrawn. The British then occupied Zeilah, Berbera and
Bulhar and sent officials from Aden to administer these ports, and a British Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somaliland coast from Zeilah to Berbera. By 1887 a series of treaties guaranteeing British protection had been concluded with various Somali tribes and in the following year the limits of the British and French spheres of influence were defined. The other inland boundaries of the Protectorate were defined by agreements with Italy in 1894 and Ethiopia in 1897.

Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the Foreign Office and in 1905 to the Colonial Office.

From 1901 until 1920 the Government was engaged in sporadic operations against the Mullah, Mohamed Abdulla Hassan. In 1910 the Government withdrew to the coast for three years but it was not until 1920 that the Mullah's power was finally broken.

In August 1940 Italian Forces from Ethiopia invaded and occupied the Protectorate but in March 1941 the British Forces drove out the Italians and a Military Government was established. The Protectorate remained under military administration until 1948 when the Civil Government was reconstituted.

In 1955, certain areas contiguous to the western and southern frontiers of the Protectorate, which had been administered by a British Military Administration under an agreement with the Imperial Ethiopian Government made in 1942 and which constitute essential grazing grounds for Protectorate tribesmen, were returned to Ethiopian administration. The Protectorate Government, however, retained the right to maintain liaison officers in these areas under a fifteen year agreement concluded between Her Majesty's Government and the Imperial Ethiopian Government in December, 1954.

**Constitution**

The constitution is based on the Somaliland Order in Council, 1929. There is no Executive Council and the power to make Ordinances is vested in the Governor. A Protectorate Advisory Council, consisting both of elected and of selected Somali representatives of all sections of the people, was established in 1947: there is also a non-statutory Governor's Council of official members. An Order in Council made in 1955 provided for the establishment of a Legislative Council and the necessary financial arrangements have been made to enable the Council to function in 1957. Local Government Councils with executive powers have been established for the two principal towns of Hargeisa and Berbera.

**Land Policy**

Government recognizes, or grants, individual title to land only in the towns. Apart from a small number of old freehold and waqf* titles, land in the towns is held on lease from the Government. Outside the towns there is no alienation of land.

**Taxation**

The principal form of taxation is indirect, i.e. Customs import and export duties. There is no income tax, but a form of business profits tax was introduced in 1955. The only other form of direct taxation is a house tax payable by owners or occupiers of property, which is assessed at 10% of the annual rental value of the property. In addition, a municipal sales tax, or octroi, exists on certain commodities, e.g. livestock and cereals brought for sale into specific townships.

**Public Finance**

In 1955-56 some £652,917 of the entire local revenue was derived from Customs and Excise duties. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

| Expenditure | £       |
|-------------|---------|
| Public Works | 366,057 |
| Education and Medical | 164,826 |
| Administration | 179,038 |
| Development and Welfare | 113,846 |
| Police and Prisons | 173,464 |
| External Relations | 42,371 |

There is no Public Debt of the Protectorate apart from the liability to repay loans-in-aid amounting to £236,000 received from the United Kingdom during the years 1921-34, should circumstances permit.

Currency

The currency in circulation is the East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The rupee currency of India, which was legal tender until 31st October, 1951, was withdrawn in that year. The East African currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

Under the 1940 and 1945 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts, the Protectorate received allocations totalling £917,232. This figure includes £60,000 made available from the Central African Reserve. Grants made under this total allocation were as follows:

| Service                  | Amount   |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Basic Services           | £343,828 |
| Social Services          | £233,894 |
| Productive Services      | £301,546 |
| Protectorate Reserve     | £37,964  |

(of which £35,600 was set aside for a scheme for a Camel Abattoir and Meat Processing factory).

Under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, a further £1,000,000 has been allocated to the Protectorate. This has been distributed as follows:

| Service                  | Amount   |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Basic Services           | £375,100 |
| Social Services          | £204,653 |
| Productive Services      | £368,399 |
| Protectorate Reserve     | £51,848  |

To the Protectorate Reserve will be added the amount of £139,281 representing the unexpended balances at 31st March, 1956, of the grants made under the 1940 and 1945 Acts.

The above figures do not include Grants made for research and centrally administered schemes, for which, under the 1940 and 1945 Acts, grants of £8,299 and £99,763 were approved.

As the territory is substantially grant-aided, it cannot provide additional finance by raising loans or from its own resources though, for several schemes approved under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, provision is made for an increasing amount of recurrent expenditure to be borne from local resources, to the extent that, by the completion date for such schemes, the Protectorate will be bearing the full recurrent costs.

Other Development

Two Somaliland subsidiaries of American Oil Companies have for some time been engaged on geological survey and exploration work in the Protectorate. Another company has taken out an oil exploration licence. An American Company has been surface mining and exporting small quantities of mica, beryl and columbite.

Considerable interest is now being taken in the very large deposits of gypsum and anhydrite located only a few miles from the port of Berbera.

Education

Expenditure on education in 1935–36 was £500 whilst in 1955–56 it was £80,720. There are now 63 grant-aided private Koranic schools (1,800 pupils in 1955). There are also 16 Government and 3 Local Authority elementary schools including a girls’ school opened in 1953; and 3 Intermediate Schools. There is also a Vocational Training Centre for 40 teachers and clerical trainees, 2 other Technical and Vocational Schools for boys and a small Secondary School to take a maximum of 60 boys. Thirty-three have been sent for further education in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. There are small Government schools for European and Indian children. Since there are no missions operating in the Protectorate there are no mission schools.

Libraries, etc.

There is in Hargeisa a “Secretariat Library” (predominantly non-fiction) which is open to members of the public as well as to Government officials. There are also ten Government reading rooms (with public listening radio sets installed) in the main towns and settlements.

Health

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1935–36 was £11,000. The expenditure for 1955–56 was £105,822.

The commoner diseases are the respiratory diseases, particularly lobar pneumonia, tropical ulcer, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, eye complaints—mainly conjunctivitis—diarrhoea and dysentery and malaria. Malaria is seasonal and its incidence from year to year varies with the rainfall: it sometimes assumes epidemic proportions particularly in the “Haud” grazing areas south of the Protectorate, but its incidence is generally low and no administrative headquarters can be classified as malarious. A large scale project with U.N.I.C.E.F., aid for the control of epidemic malaria was to have begun in 1956 but the whole scheme was vitiated by the refusal of the Ethiopian Government to allow spraying teams to enter the Haud grazing area. General measures for prevention of disease are largely directed to raising the standard of housing and environmental sanitation in the towns, and to education of the people in the avoidance of disease. Tuberculosis control measures are largely dependent on treatment of infectious cases at present. A tuberculosis sensitivity survey was carried out by a W.H.O. team in 1956. Plans based on their findings are in course of preparation.

There are six district hospitals, with a capacity of 566 beds. The Mental Hospital at Berbera has accommodation for 65 patients and the Tuberculosis Hospital at Hargeisa has 145 beds. There are, in addition, 14 district dispensaries, manned by locally trained dressers while over 80 Tribal Aids live and work amongst the nomads.

During 1955 96,307 persons were treated at hospital out-patients departments; of these 9,335 were admitted. There were 42,262 first attendances at district dispensaries.

Communications

Regular air services are maintained by Aden Airways between Hargeisa, Berbera and Aden, and with East Africa and Addis Ababa. There are no internal services or railways.

There are approximately 3,000 miles of gravel or earth roads.

A fairly regular weekly steamer service operates between Aden and Berbera. Other sea communications are maintained by dhow. The Brocklebank Line maintains a monthly service from the United Kingdom to Berbera during the months October to April.

Broadcasting

The Government Information Office maintains a broadcasting station at Hargeisa known as Radio Somalil, which transmits with power of 1 kW.
on a wavelength of 7·125 Mc/s. for one and a half hours per day. Government receiving sets are installed in schools, village settlements and community centres throughout the Protectorate. A large number have also been issued to the rural constabulary. The sets are carried by camel through the rural areas and are operated for the benefit of the nomads. Privately owned receivers are not licensed.

**Principal Occupations**

Government service, public works and the Desert Locust Control Organization of the East Africa High Commission, provide, in effect, the only source of local employment and numbers of Somali emigrate in search of work. The large majority of the people are nomads with camels, sheep and goats. The growing of crops, though still on a small scale, is increasing. It is estimated that there are some 12,000 small farms in the country, most of them less than ten acres in extent.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main animal products are: sheep on the hoof (for the Arabian markets, particularly Aden), sheep and goat skins (for the American and European markets) and cattle on the hoof for the Near East. A rough estimate of the livestock population owned by British Protected Persons is:—camels 1,200,000; sheep and goats, probably not less than 10,000,000. There are also some cattle and horses. Some sorghum and maize is grown for local consumption, the total acreage being about 130,000 acres.
