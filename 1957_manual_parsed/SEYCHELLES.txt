SEYCHELLES

Area

The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156 square miles.

Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to cover 55 square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Félicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.

Population

The estimate at 30th June, 1955, was 38,671.

Principal Town

Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 9,000.

Geographical Features

The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.
Climate

In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare. The average annual rainfall in Victoria in 1954 was 90-88 inches and the mean temperature was 82°.

History

The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May, 1794, when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Isle de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, three official members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. Residents are eligible for the following personal allowances:

- Earned income .. 1/10 (max. Rs. 1,500)
- Personal (single) .. Rs. 500
- Personal (married) .. Rs. 2,000
- Child .. Rs. 500 (max. 2,500).

Rates of tax chargeable after deduction of allowances are:

- 2½% on first Rs. 3,000 taxable income.
- 5% on next Rs. 3,000 then increasing by 2½% for each Rs. 1,000 of taxable income up to Rs. 15,000.
- Rs. 15,000–Rs. 25,000, 30%.
- Rs. 25,000–Rs. 40,000, 40%.
- All taxable income over Rs. 40,000, 50%.

Companies pay a flat rate of 30%.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

* The figures from 1953 exclude C.D. and W. moneys.

In 1955 38·03% of revenue was derived from Customs and 34·19% from direct taxes. Repayment of the Public Debt of Seychelles was made in 1954.

Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Notes of 1 rupee and 50 cents are however being gradually withdrawn from circulation. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d.

Development Plans

A Development Plan for the years 1946 to 1956 has been in operation for the building of new roads, schools and clinics, housing, reafforestation, and health development, towards the cost of which an allocation of £250,000 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act a further allocation of £170,000 has been made towards development plans for 1956–60.
Education

There are 33 primary schools, 2 secondary modern schools, 2 secondary grammar schools, a trade training centre, a pupil teacher centre, and a teacher-training centre. Continuation classes are also held.

There are 2,661 boys and 2,619 girls in the primary schools and 174 boys and 202 girls in the secondary schools. The professional teacher-training course provides the only higher education in the Colony. Twenty-four students are studying in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education in 1955 was Rs. 694,372 of which Rs. 144,784 was from United Kingdom funds. Expenditure in 1935 was Rs. 27,528.

Libraries

There are no Free Libraries. Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust, with a small branch at Anse Royale, and there are small libraries run by the Co-operative Book Society, the French Consulate, and the Roman Catholic Mission.

Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has almost none of the diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria and yellow fever are absent and filariasis infrequent. The incidence of leprosy is diminishing. Venereal disease is rapidly coming under control. An Intestinal Clinic has been started to reduce intestinal infestations. Apart from these diseases there is tuberculosis, which is rather more frequent than had been previously thought, and is also receiving attention.

Preventive medicine is gradually coming into operation in the Colony. A separate Public Health Section under the supervision of a Medical Officer of Health was created in 1956. This section works in close co-operation with the World Health Organization team engaged in the joint project of environmental sanitation.

On the curative side the Seychelles Hospital (110 beds) is capable of dealing with most medical, surgical, maternity and eye cases, with the assistance of a fully equipped laboratory and small X-ray plant. Apart from Seychelles Hospital there are small hospitals at Anse Royale (Mahé), Baie St. Anne (Praslin) and on La Digue Island while out-patient clinics are held at Grand Anse (Praslin), Beoliere (North Mahe) and Takamaka (South Mahe). Dental facilities are available daily in Victoria. Expenditure on medical services in 1955 was estimated at Rs. 652,689 or Rs. 16.43 per head of the population. In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 72,682.

Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet, earth-surfaced. Tarmac surfacing is in progress in Victoria and suburbs.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 55 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé, and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. British India Steam Navigation Company and Eastern Shipping Corporation both have passenger vessels on the Bombay–Mombasa service which call at Seychelles once each way every two months. Direct loading cargo steamers from the United Kingdom call quarterly.

Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and wired broadcasting) Station broadcasts nightly for one hour on a wavelength of 60.2 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 40 W. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 20,000 are so employed. Other occupations are:

- Domestic service: 2,947
- Artisans: 2,380
- Public administration and the professions: 504
- Trade and commerce: 323

There are three registered Trade Unions—

(1) The Stevedores and Lighterage Workers’ Union.
(2) The Seychelles Building Trades Union (membership 145).
(3) The General Workers’ Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

The livestock population is estimated at:—cattle 2,000; pigs 2,000; goats 1,000; poultry 40,000.

Inshore fisheries’ estimated production is 1,000–1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds’ eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production has commenced.

Dry patchouli leaf exports have increased in recent years, tonnage in 1952, 1953, 1954 and 1955 respectively being 40, 53, 67, and 38. Dry salted fish and shark exports amounted to 186 tons in 1955, valued at Rs. 154,919.

The chief imports are grain and flour, sugar, cotton piece-goods, vehicles, beer, petroleum and petroleum products.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

There are as yet no true co-operative societies in the colony. Agricultural credit is available from the Seychelles Agricultural Bank. The Seychelles Copra Association, consisting of producers and shippers, is responsible for the marketing of copra. The Copra Price Stabilization Ordinance, 1949, provides for a cess of 6% of the f.o.b. price of copra. These funds may be used to subsidize prices to the producer should world prices decline.
