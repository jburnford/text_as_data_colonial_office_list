UGANDA

Area
The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles (Northern Province 28,898, Buganda 25,631, Eastern Province 25,607, Western Province 13,845) of which 13,689 square miles are water and swamp.

Population
The total population of the Protectorate as shown by the 1948 census—excluding Polish refugees and a very small number of persons in transit—was 4,958,520, made up as follows:

| Africans | 4,917,555 |
|----------|-----------|
| Indians  | 33,767    |
| Goans    | 1,448     |
| Arabs    | 1,475     |
| Europeans| 3,448     |
| Others   | 827       |

The estimated total in 1955 was 5,508,000.

Principal Towns
The principal towns are Entebbe (seat of the Governor and the Central Government, population about 8,000), Kampala (commercial capital, population nearing 43,000), Jinja (population over 19,000), Mbale and Masaka. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Tororo, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale and Mubende.

Geographical Features
The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,000 feet or less in the neighbourhood of Lake Albert and the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Mufumbiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,547 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margherita (16,763 feet) and Alexandra (16,703 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasien (10,050 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, the Aswa and the Malawa. The total area of forest is approximately 2,677 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

Climate
The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° and 75° and at Entebbe the mean temperature, the mean maximum and the mean minimum are 70°, 78°, and 63°, respectively. The average annual rainfall varies between 40 and 55 inches, according to the area, over most of Uganda. The rainy season is not well-defined but there is generally one dry season from December to February and one fairly dry season from June to July.

History
In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa’s dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company’s influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga’s kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June, 1894.
Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga's kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1899 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and in 1900 concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. The same year a similar Agreement was made with the Chiefs in Toro, and in 1901 with Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1902 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika Territory. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

**Constitution**

The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions.

Changes in structure of both Councils were approved by the Secretary of State in July, 1955. By these changes Executive Council consists of 13 members (10 of whom are Ministers), and the Governor as President.

The Legislative Council consists of 60 members and the Governor as President. The members are made up of 3 *ex officio* members, 14 other Government ministers and officials, and 13 nominated members on the Government Backbench; the remaining 30 are representative members.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the others owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 and the Buganda Agreement, 1955, by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka, acting as a constitutional ruler, with the advice of six Ministers. A hierarchy of chiefs are the executive officers of government: The Great Lukiko (i.e. the council of Buganda) contains 89 members of whom 40 are elected indirectly and 20 are elected by the county councils. In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces African local governments have been established with district councils as the most important organs. Most of these now have as their principal executive officers an elected Secretary-General and an appointed Treasurer. In the Agreement districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro special conditions prevail.

County, sub-county, parish and village chiefs are the executive officers of local government and are advised and assisted by councils. These are at four levels—the parish, the sub-county, the county and the district—which provide a chain of elections from the bottom upwards.

Under the provisions of the District Administration (District Councils) Ordinance of 1955, the district councils are being reconstituted, and elections to them are by and from the sub-county council, missing out the county council. In some districts elections to the district council are held separately and either by indirect or direct methods according to the wishes of the inhabitants.

**Land Policy**

Alienation of Crown land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended except for land required for mining purposes and within townships. Native-owned land may not be transferred to a non-native without the Governor's consent. There are a few non-native estates.

**Taxation**

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll tax, export taxes, stamp and estate duties, Customs and excise duties.

*Income Tax* is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from or received in East Africa by residents after any personal allowances have been deducted, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents. There is provision for double taxation relief between Uganda and the United Kingdom. Any person liable to pay African poll tax is exempt from paying income tax. A surtax is imposed on every £ of total income in excess of £2,000. On £2,004 the surtax is 1/- rising to Shs. 45,187/- on a total income of £9,500. Thereafter the next £10,500 is charged 10/- for every £ and the next £30,000 Shs. 10/50 for every £. Where total income exceeds £50,000 per annum the rate on the excess is 11/- in every £.

*Poll Tax* is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of 6/- per year throughout the Protectorate. An African Local Government Tax is levied by African local governments varying from 10/- to 150/- according to district and capacity to pay. Non-African Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £5 on incomes exceeding £200 per annum, and £3 on lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

*Export Taxes* are levied on lint cotton, coffee and hides and skins on a sliding scale by value, and on cotton seed by weight.

*Companies Tax.*—The rate of Income Tax applicable to companies is 4/- on every £ of chargeable income accrued in, derived from or received in the Protectorate. Non-resident companies are assessed on the same basis as resident companies.

*Customs and Excise.* The tariff is divided into *ad valorem*, specific and free goods. *Ad valorem* duties vary from 10% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 22% *ad valorem*. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer and matches.

Development Plans

A five-year Capital Development Plan was drawn up in 1954 to cover the period 1955-60. This plan envisaged capital development expenditure of £30,000,000, in the following categories:

| Category                                      | Expenditure (£) |

Total: £30,000,000

This plan is being revised in the light of more recent information regarding the finance likely to be available from each of these sources.

Other Development

The Government has established the Uganda Development Corporation Limited with an authorized capital of £8,000,000 (£5,000,000 issued) to develop the resources of the Protectorate and to encourage and assist private enterprise in the establishment of new industries. Its main subsidiary companies are the Uganda Cement Industry Limited, the Uganda Fish Marketing Corporation Limited, the Lake Victoria Hotel Limited, Agricultural Enterprises Limited and Uganda Consolidated Properties Limited.

The Corporation is also a partner in a number of enterprises engaged in the development of mining, the textile industry and other manufactures. One of these, Kilembe Mines Limited, is producing copper and cobalt from the deposits at Kilembe, in Toro. Another, the Sukulu Mines Limited, has been formed to mine and process the mineral complex at Sukulu, near Tororo, which consists principally of apatite, magnetite, and pyrochlore.

The Uganda Electricity Board, a Government financed utility Corporation, is pressing forward with extensions to the distribution of electricity supplies which are obtained mainly from the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja where there is an installed capacity of 60,000 kW. and which is capable of expansion to provide 130,000 kW. It is estimated that there is an additional potential output of some 500,000 kW. in the 19 mile stretch of the river Nile below Owen Falls.

Education

The majority of the African Schools in Uganda are managed by religious Voluntary Agencies; administration of Asian Schools is shared between Government and the local communities. Primary education is provided for European children in the big towns.

At the end of 1955 there were 1,899 grant-aided primary schools (258,877 pupils) and 98 grant-aided secondary schools (13,115 pupils). The number of un-aided schools exceeded 2,250. The total estimated school population is approximately 370,000. At the end of 1955 there were also 42 Teacher-Training Colleges with a total enrolment of 3,344 students.

The University College of East Africa at Makerere (Kampala) was established in 1939 as an independent self-governing institution catering for all the East African territories; since 1953 the College has been in special relationship with London University and students have been awarded degrees of that University. In addition 177 Uganda students were in receipt of scholarships or bursaries from various sources and were attending courses of higher education overseas.
The total recurrent expenditure on all types of education, including capital grants to schools managed by Voluntary Agencies, in the financial year 1954-55 was £3,324,790. Expenditure on school buildings by the Public Works Department totalled £327,188. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Libraries and Museums, etc.

There is a public library at Kampala; the Uganda Museum is also situated there.

Health

The commonest causes of illness are malaria, respiratory infections, trachoma, tropical ulcers and venereal disease, and particular attention is being paid to the prevention and treatment of these conditions. Special wards for the treatment of tuberculosis are being built at three district hospitals and a Medical Officer with special training will be responsible for co-ordinating investigations and control of tuberculosis throughout the Protectorate. Very considerable progress has been made in the treatment of leprosy and the system of village settlements is expanding rapidly.

The principal hospitals for all races are at Kampala, the African Hospital being closely associated with Makerere College Medical School. The Medical Department and African Local Authorities maintain 30 hospitals and six rural hospitals as well as two hospitals in prisons and a mental hospital. There is also a network of 160 dispensaries run by the Medical Department and the African Local Government. One hundred and thirteen of these dispensaries have beds. The dispensaries are in charge of Medical Auxiliaries, but are visited by Medical Officers at frequent intervals. There are also 98 aid posts which are run in conjunction with certain dispensaries. Missionary Societies provide nine hospitals and 41 smaller units. Hospitals and dispensaries of employers of labour provide 510 beds. The total number of beds throughout the Protectorate is 7,082 of which 1,066 are reserved for maternity cases. There are 1·3 hospital beds per 1,000 of the population.

In 1955, 77,668 patients were admitted to Government hospitals, and 811,233 were treated as out-patients. A total of 2,813,061 patients were treated in Government hospitals and dispensaries during 1955; an average just less than one person in two throughout the Protectorate attended a Government medical unit for treatment at least once during the year.

Expenditure on the Medical Department for the financial year 1954-55 was £1,199,103 compared with £148,907 in 1935.

Communications

At Entebbe there is a first-class international airport which can accept the largest aircraft now flying commercially and is extensively used by B.O.A.C., Central African Airways, Air France, Sabena, etc. Nearly 68,000 passengers used the airport in 1955. There are also landing grounds at Jinja, Kasese, Tororo, Mbarara, Masindi, Gulu, Soroti, Arua, Lira, and Moroto.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission"). With the recent opening of the Western Uganda extension, a connexion has been established from the Coast to Kasese, near the Belgian Congo border. The Administration also maintains a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga between Namasagali and Masindi Port; and on Lake Victoria between Port Bell, Entebbe, Kisumu and Tanganyika ports. A service is maintained on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule (connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan) and between Butiaba and the Belgian Congo port of Kasenyi. A road transport service operates between Masindi Port and Butiaba. A through service is thus provided by the Railway Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Belgian Congo.

The Public Works Department maintains 405 miles of tarmac road and 2,494 miles of all-weather murram roads connecting the principal towns; the various African Local Governments between them maintain a further 4,418 miles of all-weather murram roads and 3,881½ miles of lesser murram roads of variable standard.

Broadcasting

The Uganda Broadcasting Service commenced regular transmission on 1st March, 1954, and now broadcasts daily in English, Luganda, and Luyoro. Plans are in hand for extending this service to include Lwo and Ateso broadcasts. It operates on 5,026 kc/s per second in the 60 metre short wave band, and on 308·9 metres in the medium wave band from two 5kW and one 7·5kW transmitters situated at Bugolobi, Kampala. Permanent studios were opened in Kampala in 1955.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle-raising on their own account. The numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in the principal industries and occupations in June, 1955 were: Agriculture 46,908; Government service (administrative) 11,526; African local government 35,393; cotton ginning 22,359; forestry and fishing 3,267; transport and communications 8,586; wholesale and retail trade 5,458; manufactures, including electricity 23,992; mining and quarrying 6,752; building and construction 40,482; education and medical services 20,748; other services 13,526: total 238,997.

The foregoing figures are based on a census covering employers of five or more persons excluding domestic servants. The figures are, however, not complete as the many thousands of Africans working in ones and twos for African employers are not included. The estimated total numbers in employment, including occupations where less than five are employed, are approximately 300,000 Africans, 14,500 Asians; 3,800 Europeans.

More interest is being shown in trade unionism, and there are now ten registered trade unions. The formation of joint staff committees and works councils is actively encouraged and this simple form of industrial relations machinery has now been introduced in 70 of the larger employing establishments covering some 38,000 employees.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), maize, sugar, tea, tobacco, millets, plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava and groundnuts.

The number of cattle sold in established markets in 1955 was 96,000. Hides and skins are an important export.
Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hardwoods. Internal consumption is rising rapidly and most of the timber available for export is absorbed by the other East African territories, from which in return the bulk of the Protectorate's softwood imports are obtained. In 1955 some 33,000 tons of sawn timber were produced.

The chief ore minerals are tungsten and beryl of which 146 and 138 tons respectively were produced in 1955. In addition a quantity of tin and small quantities of columbite-tantalite, galena, and bismuth ore are produced. Gold production in 1955 was 449 ounces.

The fishing industry is of growing importance to Uganda. At present production is approximately 25,000 tons per year with a value of £1 million and of this total some 17,000 tons is consumed within the country, the remainder being exported to other East African Territories and the Belgian Congo.

The cement factory of Uganda Cement Industries has recently come into production at Tororo, and preliminary steps for the erection of a textile factory at Jinja have been completed. In the 1955-56 season 138 cotton ginneries were operating. The coffee crop was handled by twelve coffee curing works. Seven hulleries, capable of bringing coffee to fair average quality standards, processed fixed quotas of the crop. A number of estate coffee factories processed the coffee grown on the larger estates. Amongst other undertakings processing agricultural produce were two sugar factories, 14 tea factories, one tobacco manufacturing works and large numbers of maize mills and oil-expressing mills.
