CYPRUS

Area

The island of Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, is 3,572 square miles in area.

Population

The estimated population at 30th June, 1956, was 527,000. The distribution of population by religion in the 1946 census was as follows:

| Religion          | Estimated Population in 1956 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Greek Orthodox    | 80-3                        |

Geographical Features

The three main zones are:

(a) the Kyrenia range which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;
(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet); and
(c) the central plain, known as the "Mesaoria".

Climate

The mean temperature as recorded in Nicosia for the last 20 years is 66.7°F.; mean maximum 78.5°F.; mean minimum 54.9°F.; highest shade temperature during that time, 111.8°F.; lowest, 22.9°F.; average rainfall for the last 20 years, 21.36 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island. The climate is varied; hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the coast; on the hills inland it is bracing and healthy. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point on the plains and is mild on the coast, whilst the inland mountains are snow-covered for several weeks.

History

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Egypt, Persia, Rome and Byzantium. During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem.

Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Constitution

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 15 elected members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the Administrative Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

On the 26th November, 1955, a state of emergency was declared in Cyprus. Under the Emergency Regulations the Governor has special powers for the maintenance of law and order in face of the campaign of armed attacks on security personnel and civilians and on public buildings which began in April, 1955. The Governor had previously assumed direct control of all internal security operations in the island, which he exercises through a Chief of Staff.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

Taxation

Incomes which do not exceed £300 are exempted from income tax; and the tax ranges from 50 mils for every £ in excess of £300 to 750 mils for every £ in excess of £6,000. Relief is given at the rate of £50 for each unmarried child under the age of 16 or (if over 16) receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment. Where any child between the ages of 11 and 25 is receiving full-time instruction outside the Colony, this allowance is increased to an amount not exceeding £250 in respect of expenditure incurred on the child's maintenance and education. Relief is also given in respect of the wife's earned income up to a maximum of £50, and in respect of life insurance premiums and pension and provident fund contributions. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33½%, rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90, up to a maximum of £500. The tax on salaries, wages and pensions is collected under the system of Pay As You Earn. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 425 mils in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus deducted in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.
Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage is levied by "layers" and ranges between 21% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business, and for estate duty paid in respect of the same estate in any country of the British Commonwealth.

The general revenue balance on the 31st December, 1955, was £6,111,978.

The Public Debt at 31st December, 1955, amounted to £9,749,654 with accumulated sinking funds for the funded debt amounting to £1,355,062. The outstanding amount of loans made by the Colony on the same date was £13,494,977 of which £500,000 was for loan made to Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, £5,483,926 to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, £1,500,000 to the Grain Commission, £1,499,915 to the Cyprus Inland Telecommunications Authority, and £4,511,136 for loans to local authorities, etc., in Cyprus.

### Currency

Notes of the following denominations are in circulation:—£5, £1, 500 mils and 250 mils. (£ = 1,000 mils).

Coins in circulation:
- Cupro-nickel, 100 mils, 50 mils and 25 mils.
- Bronze, 5 mils and 3 mils.

### Development Plans

The Ten-year Development Plan, 1946–56, has now been completed. Actual expenditure amounted to £6,005,928 and the balance of £1,898,771 (of this amount £1,396,726 is for finishing old schemes) has been transferred to the New Development Programme which is estimated to cost £38 million though some of the more ambitious projects will not be completed by 1961, the end of the current Development period. The programme provides for expenditure on agriculture, including agricultural credit, forestry, irrigation and water development, a more intensive geological survey, port, road and rural development, education, particularly technical education, and housing, and for finance to the two public utility authorities, viz. the Electricity Authority of Cyprus and the Cyprus Inland Telecommunications Authority. A substantial part of the amount required to carry out this programme will be provided from the Island’s own resources.

### Other Development

Development works carried out during 1955 by the Electricity Authority of Cyprus in the main towns of the Island have led to increases in units supplied of the order of 35%. The number of consumers connected to the supply at 31st December, 1955, totalled 42,001, an increase of 4,345 over the preceding year. The number of units sold was 69,217,687, being an increase of 56·9% over sales during 1954. The average price per unit sold showed a reduction of 0·658 mils compared with 1954.

Work on the installation of two 90,000 lb./hr. boilers and one 14,000 kW turbo-alternator set is proceeding satisfactorily and there is every expectation that it will be completed according to programme.

A substantial portion of the Second Stage extensions to the primary and secondary transmission systems has been erected and work is proceeding for completion. Surveys and preparation of plans were in hand for the distribution mains to be constructed in 26 of the 90 villages scheduled under this stage.

There has also been considerable development in the Morphou-Astromeritis area in the use of power by farmers for irrigation purposes.

### Education

Two teachers’ training colleges, one accommodating 200 men students at Morphou and another for 100 women students at Nicosia, provide the only form of higher education at present available in Cyprus; a new and larger mixed training college is now under construction. Secondary Schools number 58, with a total enrol-
ment of 19,660, while there are 723 Government Elementary Schools with an enrolment of 77,209 and 18 non-Government Elementary Schools with an enrolment of 1,849. There are usually separate schools for Greeks, Turks and Armenians, but most schools are co-educational; a small number of Elementary and Secondary Schools cater for all communities.

A plan for the development of technical education in the Island was drawn up in 1955; a preparatory technical school for 240 boys is already in existence, and a secondary technical school for 900 boys, a technical school (craft training) for 240 boys, and a new Technical Institute, were opened in September, 1956. Two post-elementary rural central schools provide an education with a practical agricultural bias to the sons of the farming community. Twenty-five Evening Institutes in various towns and villages cater for ex-elementary school pupils in the 14 to 17 age group who have not attended secondary schools.

Government expenditure on educational services in 1955-56 amounted to £1,292,000 compared with £1,014,403 in 1954-55 and £121,986 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

There are public libraries in Nicosia, Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia, which are controlled by the Municipalities. Small lending libraries have been opened by enterprising booksellers in Limassol and Nicosia. The Antiquities Department maintains museums in Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos.

Health

The Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a home for disabled) provided 1,221 beds in 1955. In addition there were 726 beds in 53 private hospitals and 115 beds in 13 rural hospitals. Out-patients (first-attendances) at the six District Hospitals numbered 142,514; rural dispensaries dealt with 43,892 cases.

Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £619,868 in 1955 compared with £52,436 in 1935.

Communications

Cyprus Airways Limited provide air services to Greece, Turkey, Beirut, Cairo, Tel Aviv (Lod), and in conjunction with B.E.A. to Rome-London. Other airlines serving the Colony are Greek National Airlines, El Al, Middle East Airlines, Air Liban, Turkish State Airlines, Misrair and Skyways Limited (Colonial coach class service). The only international airport is at Nicosia. There are no internal services.

The following table shows the roads, excluding Forest Department roads, which exist in the Colony:

| Commissioners' roads (mostly gravel) | 1,780 |
|-------------------------------------|-------|
| P.W.D. roads (gravel)               | 150   |
| P.W.D. roads (asphalt)              | 795   |
|                                     | 2,725 |

The main ports in the Island are Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol. Famagusta has a harbour where vessels of an overall length of 425 feet and a maximum draught of 22½ feet can easily be berthed alongside the quay. Vessels at Larnaca and Limassol anchor in the open roadstead about 4-5 cable off the main jetty, and goods are transported to and from the shore by means of lighters.

Regular passenger services are run between Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean. Cargo ships of many nationalities—the most regular being vessels of the British Conference Lines (Mediterranean Section), some of which accept passengers—call at Cyprus ports, on voyages between British, Continental and Mediterranean ports, Mediterranean and Red Sea ports and U.S.A., Mediterranean and Black Sea ports.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

Broadcasting

The Cyprus Broadcasting Service, which has been operating since October 1953, is situated at Athalassa a few miles out of Nicosia. It transmits on two medium-wave frequencies of 692 kc/s for the Greek service on a power of 20 kW and 606 kc/s for the Turkish service on a power of 20 kW. In addition there is also a Relay Station at Paphos transmitting on 908 kc/s with a power of 2 kW and another at Limassol transmitting on 1,484 kc/s on a power of 250 watts. The majority of the programmes are broadcast in Greek and Turkish but there are also English transmissions on both channels. There are approximately 75,000 wireless licence holders in Cyprus.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupation is agriculture in which some 143,000 persons are employed. Approximate numbers in other occupations:

- Building and Construction: 20,000
- Other manufacturing industries: 41,000
- Commerce, Public Administration, Transport, other Services: 58,000
- Employed by Government: 16,000
- Mining: 6,500

At the end of 1955 there were four Employers’ Associations with 177 members, and 152 Workmen’s Unions with a membership of 35,757. In addition there were three Federations co-ordinating the activities of Workmen’s Unions, with a membership of 30,513 and five Unions of Civil Servants, with a membership of 3,258.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products are wheat, barley, potatoes (two crops a year), onions, vegetables, legumes, linseed, hemp fibre, sesame, cumin, aniseed, tobacco, carobs (locust beans), almonds, olives, figs, citrus, deciduous fruits, pomegranates, vine products, cheese, wool, hides and skins.

The livestock population in 1955 was:

- Camels: 308 (Biennial count)
- Horses, mules and donkeys: 59,091 (Biennial count)
- Cattle: 34,718 (Biennial count)
- Sheep: 382,236
- Goats: 147,349
- Pigs: 34,376
- Poultry: 1,500,000 (Estimated)
- Rabbits: 100,000 (Estimated)

Timber production in 1955 was 1,220,000 cubic feet R.U.B. including 1,146,000 cubic feet of softwood (pine) and 74,000 of hardwood timber. Firewood and charcoal production amounted to 534,000 and 30,000 cubic feet respectively. All these products were consumed in Cyprus. In addition 2,657,000 cubic feet of timber and 651,000 of derivative products were imported in 1955.
Cyprus fisheries are not rich owing to the lack of nutrient salts, and the supply of fish is not equal to the demand. All the catch (440,935 okes* in 1955) is sold locally and consumed fresh. Production of inshore fisheries is negligible.

The principal minerals are cupreous and iron pyrites and asbestos. Some 900,000 tons of pyrites, 100,000 tons of copper concentrates and 15,000 tons of asbestos are exported yearly. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced and exported.

In addition to the major industries of agriculture and mining a cement factory and a number of up-to-date flour mills were established during the year. Light manufacturing industries include the following: macaroni; canned fruit and vegetables; jams and marmalades; turkish delight, sugared almonds, caramels and other confectionery; carob gum; grape juice; animal fodder; beer, aerated and other soft drinks; cigarettes; cotton yarn; cotton and rayon cloth; shirts and underwear; hosiery; footwear; quilts; lace and embroidery; furniture; leather handbags and travel goods; olive and olive kernel oils, cotton-seed oil; perfumery, soap; polishes; essential oils; bricks and roofing tiles; pottery and earthenware; cement tiles ("mosaic"); gypsum plaster and plasterboard; asbestos sheets; nails; lithographed crown corks; baskets; metal containers; motor bodies and carts; buttons; artificial teeth; ice; brooms. A factory for tyre retreading is also operating in the Island.

Some of these are scarcely more than minor cottage industries but most of them operate in factory conditions. Poultry breeding developed considerably during the year but the demand would easily entertain more similar concerns. There was very intense building activity during 1956, both private and for the Armed Services, and a great expansion of some of the plants supplying the building industry has been observed.

The chief imports are wheat, timber, mineral fuels and lubricants, manufactured fertilizers, cotton, silk and woollen manufactures, cement, iron and steel manufactures and machinery and transport equipment.

### Tourist Traffic

During 1955 32,149 visitors came to Cyprus compared with 32,755 in 1954. In addition 65,376 passengers passed through Cyprus in transit and 5,674 members of H.M. Forces and their families stationed in the Middle East spent their summer leave in Cyprus.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no Marketing Boards in Cyprus, but the Government, acting through an appointed Board set up under special legislation as the Grain Commission, is the sole purchaser of wheat and barley using as its agents the co-operative societies in the villages.

Under other legislation a Vine Products Scheme has been established with the Commissioner for Co-operative Development as Controller. This Scheme purchases all grape alcohol (zivania) from the producers and resells to manufacturers of wines and spirits at a price which is fixed every six months. The Controller is advised by a Committee on which producers and manufacturers are represented. The same Scheme also purchases raisins from producers at a safety price fixed by Government and then resells.

The other form of organized marketing is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, fresh and dried fruits and potatoes. There are at present 788 co-operatives of which 484 are thrift and credit, 234 retail stores, 37 marketing and processing, 13 olive pressing, 5 transport, 6 farming, 2 machinery, 3 wholesale supply unions, 2 irrigation, 1 housing, and 1 Central Bank. Membership exceeds 139,000 and approximately 85% of the funds used by the movement comprise £916,000 of reserves and about £3,036,000 of deposits.
