THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES

(BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE AND SWAZILAND)

The Territories of Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland in southern Africa are administered on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom by a High Commissioner. The High Commissioner also holds the office of High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in the Union of South Africa. He is the sole legislative authority for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland and is responsible to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in much the same way as a Colonial Governor is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Each Territory is administered by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners.

Information about these Territories will be found in The Commonwealth Relations Office List. This brief note, and the following Civil Establishment list showing heads and deputy heads of departments and analogous appointments, have been included in The Colonial Office List 1957, because the staffs of these Territories are interchangeable with the staffs of the territories administered under the direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Biographical notes are included in the Record of Services section.
