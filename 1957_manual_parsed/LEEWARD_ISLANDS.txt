THE LEEWARD ISLANDS

Area

The Leeward Islands, which comprise the four Colonies of Antigua, St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands, have a total area of 423 square miles.

Geographical Features

The islands belong partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles and partly (the Virgin Islands) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. Anguilla, Sombrero and the British Virgin Islands lie apart, to the north and north-west. St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Redonda form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Population

The total population of the Leeward Islands at the 1946 census and the estimated population at 31st December, 1955, are shown in the following table:

|                | Census   | Estimate |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Antigua        | 41,757   | 52,454   |
| St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla | 46,243   | 54,327   |
| Montserrat     | 14,333   | 14,436   |
| British Virgin Islands | 6,505    | 7,760    |

Total          | 108,838  | 128,977  |

Climate

The climate of the islands varies slightly, but is usually dry and healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average annual rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat...
have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from June to October; the rainy season from July to December.

**History**

The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493 and became British during the seventeenth century. From the outset they have been associated geographically and politically. They were colonized from St. Kitts, were all included in the Carlisle grant, and first enjoyed a common Legislature as far back as 1674. That Legislature (or General Assembly, as it was called) did not, for various reasons, meet for many years and was finally abolished in 1798, but not before passing a humane slave amelioration Act.

By the Leeward Islands Act of 1871, enacted by the Imperial Parliament, there was created a single Colony of the Leeward Islands consisting of five Presidencies, namely, Dominica (which became a Colony of the Windward Islands on 1st January 1940), Antigua, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Montserrat and the British Virgin Islands. Provision was made for the establishment of an Executive Council and a General Legislative Council of the Leeward Islands. Members of the General Legislative Council were drawn from the Presidential Legislatures and by 1953 there was a majority of elected members on the Council. The General Legislature had concurrent legislative powers with the local Legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act but any enactment by a Presidential Legislature on such subjects was void if repugnant to an enactment of the General Legislative Council.

The British Standing Closer Association Committee in its report of 1948-49 recommended that each of the Leeward Islands should enter the proposed new British Caribbean Federation as a separate unit, instead of entering as a federation. This view was accepted and, for this and other reasons, it was decided to defederate the Leeward Islands. This took place on the 1st July, 1956, and each of the four Presidencies then became a Colony, and the Federal Executive Council and General Legislative Council automatically disappeared.

The Colonies of Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla and Montserrat are to join the proposed new British Caribbean Federation, but the Colony of the British Virgin Islands has decided not to do so.

**Administration.**

There is a Governor of the Leeward Islands who is normally resident in Antigua, though he spends several months in each year visiting the other islands. He is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Leeward Islands. The Government of each Colony is administered by a resident Administrator, who is subject to instructions from the Governor.

A Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the Chief Justices of the several British West Indian islands except Jamaica, was set up in 1920, and a Court of Appeal for the Windward and Leeward Islands was established in 1939.

The Leeward Islands’ Police Force continues to be a “federal” Force common to all the Leeward Islands despite the defederation of the Leeward Islands Colony.

There is also a common audit system for the four new Colonies.

LEEWARD ISLANDS

diagonally across the island. Barbuda is very flat with a large lagoon on the west side. There are no rivers.

History

The first settlers were a few English who arrived in 1632. In 1663 Charles II made a formal grant to Lord Willoughby, who at once proceeded to send out large numbers of colonists. For a short time the island was in French occupation, but in 1667 it was declared an English possession in terms of the Treaty of Breda and has remained British from that date.

Constitution

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Administrator, two official members and five unofficial members (one nominated member and four elected members). The Governor, and in his absence the Administrator, presides over the Executive Council. In January 1956 the ministerial system was introduced whereby three of the elected members of the Legislative Council having seats in the Executive Council hold portfolios as Ministers for Trade and Production, Public Works and Communications, and Social Services.

The Legislative Council, as reconstituted in December 1951, is composed of the Administrator as President, two official members, three nominated and eight elected members. A Deputy President is elected by the unofficial members of the Council from among their number.

Land Policy

Land may not be alienated or leased to aliens without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, alien occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 99 years. There is a small amount of Crown land which, when not used for public purposes, may be leased or sold.

Taxation

The main forms of taxation are income tax, trade tariffs and excise duties. The rates of individual income tax range from 6d. to 15s. 0d. per £ of chargeable income. Company tax is 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income.

Provision has been made for double taxation relief with the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and consideration is being given to extending the arrangements to other countries.

Development Plans

Montserrat received an allocation of £124,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 as a contribution towards a ten-year development plan. This plan was revised at the end of 1951 and grants from the Imperial Treasury now bring the total allocation to £188,000. For the period 1955–60 a further allocation of £180,000 has been made.

The 1955–60 Development Plan includes schemes for Economic Development—soil conservation, livestock projects, land clearing, vegetable production and marketing, banana cultivation, a fisheries project; Public Works—roads, flood prevention measures, erection of navigational lights for Plymouth; Social Services—health clinics, hospital improvement, housing and water supplies.

Other Development

A private company, the Montserrat Company Limited, is working side by side with Government in the development of a livestock industry. An electric light and power plant for Plymouth came into operation in 1955.

Education

Primary education and secondary education are both in the main Government-controlled. There are 12 Government elementary schools, one aided denominational school, and one elementary private school. There is one Government secondary school, and a preparatory private school for children between the ages of 5 and 12 years. At the end of 1955, of an estimated school population of 3,500, 3,201 children were enrolled in Government and aided primary schools, with an average attendance of 2,928. The enrolment of the secondary school at the end of the same period was 182.

During the year 1955 there were three students from the Colony pursuing professional courses abroad under the Leeward Islands Scholarship award; two of these students were in the United Kingdom, and one in Jamaica. Four primary school teachers were in training colleges.

Government expenditure on the Education Department in 1955 was $120,003 compared with $14,000 in 1935.

History
St. Kitts was colonized by Sir Thomas Warner in 1623. For more than a century it changed hands with the French as a result of constant warfare, but was finally restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, as was Nevis (which was colonized in 1628) and both have remained British possessions since that date. Anguilla has remained a British possession since its colonization in 1650.

Constitution
The Executive Council for the Colony consists of the Governor, the Administrator, two official members, and up to six unofficial members, of whom one represents Nevis.

In January 1956 the system was introduced whereby three of the elected members of the Legislative Council having seats in the Executive Council hold portfolios as Ministers for Trade and Production, Public Works and Communications, and Social Services respectively.

Land Policy
Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS

Area

The total area of the Colony is 67 square miles. Excluding numerous small rocks, the islands number 36, of which 11 are inhabited. The largest are Tortola (20 square miles), Virgin Gorda (13 square miles), Anegada (11 square miles) and Jost van Dyke (7 square miles).

Population

The population at the 1946 census numbered 6,505; at 31st December 1955 it was estimated to number 7,760.

Principal Town

Road Town, Tortola (population 1,200), is the seat of the Administration.

Geographical Features

The Islands, except for Anegada, represent a projection of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands archipelago. Anegada, a flat coral feature of more recent geological formation, is the northern outpost of the group in the Atlantic, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs. Virgin Gorda and Tortola rise abruptly like the tops of submerged mountains from a submarine plateau of 20-30 fathoms of water. The highest elevation is 1,780 feet on Sage Mountain, Tortola, where the remnants of an interesting xerophytic rain forest still exist.
History

In 1648 a party of Dutch buccaneers are said to have set up their abode at Soper's Hole, Tortola, but were driven out by a party of English adventurers in 1666. In 1672 Colonel Stapleton, Governor of the Leeward Islands, took Tortola from the Dutch, who were then in possession. It was not, however, until 1680, according to Suckling's historical account of the Virgin Islands, that the islands were permanently settled by English planters from Anguilla; they have been uninterruptedly British since then. In 1773 the Settlers were granted a charter and the first House of Assembly was convened the following year.

Constitution

The Administrator, who is the chief executive, administers the Government under the Governor of the Leeward Islands. The Administrator is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of himself as the ex officio member (when the Governor is present) and two official and three unofficial Members. The Virgin Islands Constitution Act, 1950, under which the legislature was constituted, was replaced by the Virgin Islands Constitution and Elections Ordinance, 1954, which provides for a Legislative Council with an elected majority elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Legislative Council consists of the Administrator as President, two nominated official members, two nominated non-official members and six elected members. The Council elects at its first meeting a Deputy President who presides in the absence of the Administrator.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot hold land except under licence from the Governor.

The total area of Crown lands is estimated at 18,000 acres. Most of it is situated in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. In Anegada, where the soil is poor, the occupants of Crown lands are allowed the use of those lands free of charge but rentals are collected from occupants of Crown lands elsewhere, where there is good soil fertility. Arrangements exist for the sale of Crown lands to occupants in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. Non-natives own approximately 2,626 acres of the total land area of the Colony. The prevailing type of tenure for all holdings is fee simple.

Taxation

Taxes consist mainly of Customs duties and land, house, road, animal, boat and income taxes. Import duties average 12% ad valorem at general rates and 8% ad valorem at preferential rates. Export duties are fixed at specific rates which average less than 5% at current market values.

The income tax rate upon the chargeable income of every person other than a company, ranges from 6d. to 13s. 6d. in the £. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 6d. in every £.

Currency

The currency is issued by the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group), and consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100 and United Kingdom silver and bronze coins. The dollar is valued at $4·80 = £1. United States currency circulates freely, and all values and prices are determined by it.

Development Plans

The Colony has been granted allocations totalling £106,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 and a further allocation of £100,000 for the period 1955-60. Expenditure on schemes up to 1952 was undertaken mainly on school buildings, agricultural and livestock development, water supplies and health projects. Since 1953 a road construction programme has been in progress; additional staff has been recruited for the Public Works Department to carry out the programme, and road-making machinery and plant have been purchased. Schemes have also been approved for the installation of radiotelephones and for a piped water supply for Road Town.

Education

There is one secondary and one primary school, maintained by Government; 12 denominational schools, which receive grants from Government funds; and four private schools. In 1955, there were 1,029 male and 1,051 female pupils enrolled at all schools. Attendance was approximately 90·7% of enrolment.

The cost of primary education, except the provision and maintenance of denominational school buildings, is met from Government funds and in 1955 the sum of $57,849 was so expended, compared with $3,446 in 1938.

Libraries

There is a Library in Road Town, said to be one of the best of the small libraries in the British Caribbean. There are library deposit stations in the out islands. In 1955 the Library had a total of 9,974 books and 1,096 registered borrowers.

Health

The Tortola Cottage Hospital has 35 beds, and a total of 207 out-patients received treatment during 1955. There were 420 in-patients. The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1955 was $51,000 compared with $2,592 in 1938.

Communications

Launches maintain a mail and passenger service with St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, whence air, sea and cable communications exist to all parts of the world. Through-bookings can be obtained at St. Thomas to almost any destination in Europe or the western hemisphere.

There is no broadcasting service in the Colony.
The Principal Occupation is stock-raising. Others are fishing, and the production of food crops and charcoal.

The Main Food Crops are vegetables and fruit.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 5,500, sheep 2,200, goats 9,000, swine 4,000. The fishing industry is unorganized.
