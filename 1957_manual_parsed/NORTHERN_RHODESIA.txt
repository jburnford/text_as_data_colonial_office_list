Geographical Features

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000-5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Machinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 703 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°-100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

### History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. de Lacerda, who led an expedition to Chief Kasembe’s capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in 1798. Though he died before reaching his goal, his diaries provide the first authoritative account of what is now north-eastern Rhodesia. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty’s Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October, 1900, the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika’s dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy of £850.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company’s administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April, 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

### Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 161). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council of nine, five officials and four unofficials, presided over by the Governor. Each unofficial member is responsible for a group of Departments. The Legislative Council consists of twenty-six members, of whom eight are official, twelve are elected Europeans, two are Europeans nominated by the Governor to represent African interests, and four are Africans, nominated by the Governor (who usually nominates those selected by the African Representative Council from among its own members). It is presided over by the Speaker, who is an unofficial but not a member of the Legislative Council.

### Land Policy

Land is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land is alienated on leasehold tenure by the Land Board which insists on certain standards of finance and farming skill. There is in certain areas freehold land held by private persons who obtained title in the early days. An Agricultural Lands Ordinance is about to be enacted making it possible for the lessee of Crown Land to obtain freehold title to his farm on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance.

### Taxation

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and customs and excise duties on the 1st April, 1954.
Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 10s. and £1 per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 2s. and 13s. 6d. per annum made by Native Authorities.

Public Finance

The establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October 1953 resulted in considerable changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements. To conform with the Federal Government's financial year, which runs from the 1st July to the 30th June, the Territory's accounts were not closed on the 31st December 1953, the financial period being extended to the 30th June 1954.

The Territory retained its full revenue and met its full recurrent expenditure up to the 31st December 1953. For the six months period ended the 30th June 1954, revenue to which the Federal Government had become entitled was collected on behalf of that Government and paid over, except that the Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April 1954. With effect from the 1st January 1954 the Federal Government assumed full financial responsibility for the Departments which it was due to take over, and refunded to the Northern Rhodesia Government the full cost of administering them. The figures in the following table relating to the first six months of 1954 are not, therefore, comparable with those in preceding years, as both revenue and expenditure totals include figures resulting from the settlements between the two Governments. The principal Departments and services taken over by the Federal Government in 1954 were as follows:

- Audit
- Civil Aviation
- Military
- Prisons
- Customs
- Income Tax
- Posts and Telegraphs
- European Education
- Health.

The main sources of revenue are now the payment received from the Federal Government representing 17% of the collections within the Federation on account of taxes on income, and the Territorial surcharge on Company Income Tax assessments also collected by the Federal Government on behalf of the Northern Rhodesia Government. These two taxes represent 56% of the estimated revenue for 1955–56, and a further 19% is derived from mineral royalties. The Northern Rhodesian Government no longer collects Customs and Excise duties. These are levied by the Federal Government, and not shared with the other Territories of the Federation.

Expenditure included the following appropriations:

Currency

The currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The present denominations are 10s., £1, £5 and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper halfpennies and pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns. Under the Federal Government's Coinage and Currency Act, 1954, the Central African Currency Board was set up; but pending the issue of a new currency the Southern Rhodesia currency remains legal tender. As from 1st January, 1955, British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Development Plans

The Northern Rhodesia Territorial Government's Development Plan is now estimated to cost £32,629,459 during the three year period ending 30th June, 1959. Expenditure will be met from the Capital Fund and is allocated as follows:

| Loans to Local Authorities | 7,250,000 |
| Loans for Power Schemes     | 3,714,873 |
| Loans for Water and Sewerage Schemes | 1,972,800 |

|                            | £32,629,459 |

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

At 31st December, 1956, there were 50 Government European schools, two Government-aided and eight private schools providing education for European children. Nine of the Government schools and one private school provided education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard. There were 13 Government hostels housing 830 children and one private hostel housing 15.

The enrolment in Government schools was 11,968; in Government-aided and private schools, 2,020. Technical training was given in conjunction with correspondence courses, and from the beginning of 1957 this field is covered on the Copperbelt by the Copperbelt Technical Foundation. This has started training under the aegis of the mines with assistance from the Ministry of Education. Government assistance in the form of bursaries, loans, etc., is available to those who proceed to higher education centres. Pupils from Northern Rhodesia may now attend the Training College for European teachers at Heany, near Bulawayo, and the University College at Salisbury.

There are 12 Government schools for Asiatics (1,149 children) and two for Coloureds (182). There is a Coloured hostel for 90 boarders and one Government-aided school accommodating 164 Coloured children.

Of approximately 500,000 African children of school age some 199,020 were in the following schools in 1955:

| No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc. |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools | 1,303 | 189,889 |
| Unaided primary schools | 72 | 5,462 |
| Secondary schools | 10 | 901 |
| Teacher training schools | 16 | 1,068 |
| Trades schools | 21 | 1,305 |
| Other vocational schools (girls) | 11 | 395 |

The only post-secondary course within the Territory is for the training of teachers in upper primary schools. Bursaries are awarded for students to attend various higher courses outside

to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Public health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

There are nine Government European hospitals in the Territory. During 1956, 8,700 patients were admitted. The principal causes of admission were heart disease, violence (including all accidents), nervous diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, malaria and colitic complaints.

The 14 Government hospitals dealt with 57,000 admissions in 1956.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 137 rural health centres.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications.

There is an international airport at Livingstone and national airports at Lusaka, Ndola and Kasama, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. Subsidiary airfields serve most of the outlying districts, but less than half are of all-weather construction.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 655 miles. During 1955 892,400 passengers and 3,522,200 tons of goods were carried.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the Territory is now 20,007, made up as follows:

| Roads Type          | Miles |
|---------------------|-------|
| Main roads          | 5,043 |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize and tobacco. Groundnut production is increasing. Small quantities of rice, cotton, pulses, citrus, potatoes, tropical fruits, vegetables and wheat are also produced.

| Main Crops—Production | 1953 | 1954 | 1955 |
|-----------------------|------|------|------|
| Maize—000 tons        | 114  | 132  | 103.5|
| Groundnuts—000 tons   | 3    | 6    | 5.5  |
| Tobacco—million lbs.  | 10.5 | 8.1  | 7.9  |

The approximate livestock population is cattle 1,140,000, sheep and goats 129,000, and pigs 50,000. During 1955 some 40,000 head of cattle were slaughtered.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is cured and marketed in the urban areas.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 982,963 tons in 1955.

The chief minerals are copper, zinc, lead, limestone and cobalt.

Production in 1955

| Quantity Approximate Value |
|---------------------------|
| Copper (electrolytic) 000 tons | 177 | £61,665 |
| Copper (blister) 000 tons | 165 | £52,221 |
| Copper (concentrates and other) 000 tons | 1 | £61 |
| Zinc 000 tons | 28 | £2,530 |
| Lead 000 tons | 16 | £1,700 |
| Cobalt (metal) 000 cwt. | 8 | £968 |
| ,, (alloy) 000 cwt. | 7 | £291 |
| ,, (other) 000 cwt. | 6 | £298 |
| Limestone 000 tons | 305 | £333 |

Also produced are tin, manganese, silver, gold, iron ore, selenium, beryl and mica.

A very large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, steel finishing work, tiles, furniture, clothing, beer, mineral waters, soap and oils, metal castings and nuts and bolts.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of imports and exports and no separate figures for Northern Rhodesia are available.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

The co-operative movement continues to progress. African membership figures in 1955 showed an overall decrease to 10,363, owing to the breakdown of two large rambling producer societies into smaller and more local societies; however, most of the ex-members are gradually rejoining their smaller local society. The total European and African membership at 31st December, 1955, was 15,428. Combined turnover of all societies was £4,479,016, while share capital paid up amounted to £370,784. Nearly 75,000 tons of produce and 4 million lbs of tobacco were marketed co-operatively during the year.

The European consumer movement continues to expand, but volume is restricted by the limitation of available working capital; total turnover for 1955 was approximately £500,000.
