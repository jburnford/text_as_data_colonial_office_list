KENYA

Area

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East African Protectorate, includes parts of the great African Lakes, Victoria and Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

Population

At 1st July, 1956, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at over 6·1 million persons, of whom over 5·9 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe     | Per cent. (1948 census) |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Kikuyu    | 19·5                    |
| Luo       | 14·4                    |
| Baluhya   | 12·5                    |
| Kamba     | 11·7                    |
| Meru      | 6·2                     |
| Nyika     | 5·6                     |

The 1948 census showed a total non-African population of 154,846 of whom 90,528 were Indians, 29,660 Europeans and 24,174 Arabs. The non-African population in mid-1956 has been estimated at 250,000.

Geographical Features

Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Teita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulai 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,120). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30-40 miles wide and 2,000-3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

Climate

The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:
(1) The coast and its immediate hinterland;
(2) The low plain, 300-2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika.
(3) The Highlands, 3,000-10,000 feet.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891), but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1887 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Under additional Royal Instructions dated the 13th of April, 1954, as amended by further Instructions dated 7th November, 1956, there was set up a Council of Ministers, consisting of the Deputy Governor and eight ex officio and eight appointed Ministers, as follows: the Chief Secretary, the Minister for Legal Affairs, the Minister for Finance and Development, the Minister for African Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Water Resources, the Minister for Internal Security and Defence, the Minister for Local Government, Health and Housing, the Minister for Education, Labour and Lands, the Minister for Forest Development, Game and Fisheries, the Minister for Commerce and Industry, the Minister for Works, the Minister for Community Development, a European Minister without portfolio and an Asian Minister without portfolio. Two further Ministers have still to be appointed.

The Executive Council consists of the Ministers and such other persons, who are styled Appointed Members, as may be appointed by the Governor. There are at present three such Appointed Members, two being African and one Arab.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor who is President, a Vice-President who is Speaker and 58 Members of whom eight are ex officio (Ministers), 18 Nominated Members (who all accept the Government whip on major issues of policy), 14 European Elected Members (of whom three have ministerial functions), six Asian Elected Members (of whom two have ministerial functions), one Arab Elected Member, eight African Representative Members (of whom one has ministerial functions and one is a Parliamentary Secretary) and one Arab Representative Member (who is also a Parliamentary Secretary). One further European elected and a second African Representative member will shortly be appointed Ministers. There are also two unofficial members nominated from names submitted by the Board of Commerce and Industry and the Board of Agriculture.

In the East African Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by one Official and four Unofficial Members, two of the latter being European, one Asian, and one African.

By the Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in September and October, 1956, for the constituencies established by the Legislative Council (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1951. This Ordinance defined the boundaries of the 14 European Electoral Areas, the five Asian and the one Arab Electoral Areas (one of which has two members).

In March, 1957, elections are to be held for the election of the eight African members who are at present styled Representative members.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by non-African Local Authorities. There are now 26 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local by-laws regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. The Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, enables District Councils in the settled areas to prepare schemes for organizing the local government of their area into a County Council. Five County Councils have now been created; these councils include five townships established under the Townships Ordinance, 1931, which had achieved self-accounting status prior to absorption as urban district councils.
In addition there are six municipalities established under the Municipalities Ordinance, 1928, including The City Council of Nairobi which received a Royal Charter in 1950. There are two self-accounting townships established under the Townships Ordinance which have not been incorporated into any county scheme of local government.

In October, 1952, a State of Emergency was declared in Kenya. The Government then assumed special powers in order to maintain law and order in the face of a campaign of violence and barbarous atrocity engineered, principally amongst the Kikuyu, by the Mau Mau secret society. The Government, aided by the Security Forces, which include the Kenya Police Reserve and the Kikuyu Home Guard, as well as by United Kingdom troops under the command of Lieutenant-General G. W. Lathbury, C.B., D.S.O., M.B.E., is making strenuous efforts to stamp out terrorism. In May, 1953, a Deputy Governor was appointed in order to lighten the administrative burden falling upon the Governor as a result of the Emergency.

**Land Policy**

All land in Kenya, apart from a few freeholds, mainly around Nairobi and in the Protectorate, falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands.

(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, may be alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation are:— income tax, which applies to all members of the community; personal tax, which applies to Europeans and Asians; poll tax, which applies to Africans; and hospital tax contribution, which applies to Europeans. Under the Income Tax Law generous personal allowances are given and the rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 1/50 in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases on a graduated scale to Shs. 11/- in the £ on incomes exceeding £50,000 per annum. In addition a surcharge of 75 cents is made on each £ of chargeable income in excess of £800. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/- in the £. The maximum rate of the personal tax is £10 per annum and the amount of the hospital contribution is calculated on the amount of total income.

The other main forms of taxation are Customs and excise duties.

In 1955–56, in addition to the expenditure of £39,025,204 mentioned above, issues from the Exchequer Account for expenditure under the Colony's Development Plan and the Swynnerton Plan for the Intensified Development of African Agriculture amounted to £8,512,502.

The Public Debt of Kenya at 30th June, 1955, was £39,142,201, made up as follows:

| Debt (£) |
|----------|
| Funded Debt | 31,830,600 (of which £6,696,091 was raised for E.A. Railways and Harbours Administration). |
| Unfunded Debt | £7,311,601 (of which £3,000,000 was an interest free loan from H.M. Government to assist with Emergency expenditure). |

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London on behalf of...
the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also British Somaliland and Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-, and Shs. 1/- notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

The Government proposals for a development programme over the period 1st January, 1954, to 30th June, 1957, are self-contained in that they are not merely an extension of the ten-year development programme, 1946–55. The circumstances prevailing when both the 1946 Development Committee and the 1951 Standing Planning Committee reported have changed in a number of important aspects. The Government considers that in the light of experience a ten-year plan becomes in time unrealistic and that, in present circumstances, three or four years is the most suitable period for which a development plan should be drawn up.

The ten-year plan envisaged expenditure of £38-8 million and by 31st December, 1953, £27-4 million had been spent; thus over eight years 70-5 per cent. of the plan had been implemented.

During the years 1946–53 no less than 18 per cent. of expenditure was financed from various appropriated funds, 24 per cent. by contributions from Colony revenue and only 45 per cent. by loan moneys. In this planning period 89 per cent. of the funds likely to be available by 30th June, 1957, will come from loan sources.

The allocations under the 1954–57 Plan total £24-244 million, but it is not now proposed to spend more than £21-779 million due to shortage of development funds and also to limited building resources being available. The Development Committee appointed under the terms of Cmd. Paper 9103 is responsible to the Council of Ministers for recommending any alterations to the Plan, which is continuously under review.

A programme is now being drawn up for a further three-year Development Plan from 1957 to 1960.

Summary of Allocations under Three-and-a-half-year Plan by Ministerial Portfolios

(a) Not including the allocation for the General Works Staff.

Emphasis will be placed in this planning period on the development of African agriculture. Expenditure on ordinary development will be partly financed from the Development Fund and partly from the £5·0 million grant made available by Her Majesty's Government for the Swynnerton Plan. If account is also taken of expenditure on African agriculture included in the three-and-a-half-year Development Plan the total of no less than £4·9 million will be spent on the development of African agriculture by the 30th June, 1957.

Education (1955)—African

The number of African post-primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions was 64, with an enrolment of 4,730 males and 789 females. Of these institutions 24 were run by Government, with an enrolment of 2,563 males and 98 females; and 39 were aided, with 2,122 males and 691 females. One was unaided, with 45 males.

There were 3,424 primary and intermediate schools with 392,897 pupils. Of these, 17 were run by Government, with an enrolment of 1,546 boys and 240 girls; 2,605 were aided with 253,949 boys and 83,972 girls; and 802 were unaided, with 41,273 boys and 11,899 girls.

There is one Government secondary school for boys, with an enrolment of 97. Eight Government primary schools had an enrolment of 1,557 boys and 522 girls, and one aided primary school had an enrolment of 67 boys and 20 girls.

Higher Education

In 1956, 55 Kenya students were admitted to Makerere College in Uganda making a total of 222 students in all from Kenya in residence.

The Royal Technical College of East Africa was opened in Nairobi in April, 1956. There are Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Science, Engineering and Commerce and a Department of Domestic Science; 208 Kenya students have been admitted, of whom 91 enjoy bursaries, and 5 Asian Teachers' Scholarships.
Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education, usually in institutions overseas. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students in going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Government of India, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

The total number of Kenya students in the United Kingdom for the academic session 1955-56 was 635. This number included 68 Africans (48 with bursaries or scholarships), 9 Arabs (7 with bursaries or scholarships), 383 Asians (65 with bursaries or scholarships), and 175 Europeans (60 with bursaries or scholarships). There were also 51 Kenya African students in India during this period, 16 in the United States, and 5 in various other countries.

Trade and Technical Education

There were three Government Technical and Trade Schools for African boys admitting students who had completed eight years of schooling for a three or four-year course of training; in 1955, 902 indentured apprentices were receiving instruction in building, engineering, tailoring and leather working.

Vocational training was also given in two aided schools and one non-aided school, and on a number of mission stations. A number of Government Departments, East African Railways and Harbours and the Posts and Telegraphs Administrations, conducted training schemes for students from the intermediate and secondary schools entering their service.

The Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education, which ranks as a Technical Institute, had 190 students enrolled in 1955.

There were two Asian Technical High Schools providing courses in technical and commercial subjects to School Certificate standard with 738 pupils on the roll.

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library and the Desai Memorial Library, both in Nairobi, and also the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. The Government has a small library of general reference books and books on Africa.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Curator, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, is assisted by a staff of eight Europeans and eighteen Africans, with part-time assistance from two other Europeans.

Health

In 1955 beds available in Hospitals (including Maternity Homes) totalled 8,429 (Government 6,243, Local Authorities 482, Missions 1,213, Private 491). In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 146,900, out-patients 1,216,912.

Total expenditure by the Medical Department on Hospital and Health Services in the fiscal year 1955 was £1,531,698, compared with £388,399 in 1945.

Communications

Eastleigh airport, Nairobi, is the main aerodrome used by international services. Internal scheduled services operated by E.A.A.C. are based on Nairobi West and operate services in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of aircraft-operating companies are based at Nairobi West. Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the Air Transport Authority.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden, Ethiopia and Madagascar.

There are approximately 22,000 miles of roads. Only about 350 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads (2,800 miles, excluding Northern Frontier Province), where not bituminized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (4,200 miles) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. Considerable improvements in alignment and formation have been effected on the main roads, and many secondary roads, during recent years. The Great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) through Kenya, from Namanga on the Tanganyika border in the south and via Nairobi, has been re-routed through Eldoret to Tororo on the Uganda border.

Broadcasting

A broadcast transmitting station providing an English and Asian service is operated in Nairobi by Messrs. Cable and Wireless, Limited. The Charter granted to the company in 1931 expired in September, 1956, but by an agreement between the company and the Government, the Cable and Wireless station will continue English and Asian broadcasts for a further three years from that date.

At Nyeri the Department of Information's African Broadcasting Service operates its own short wave transmitter and produces six hours of Kikuyu broadcasting daily in its studios there. The Department has also opened two new Regional Stations, one at Kisumu and one at Mombasa, each operating one medium wave and one short wave transmitter. Vernacular broadcasts, previously transmitted from Nairobi by the African Broadcasting Service, in Luo, Luluhya and Nandi/Kipsigis, Kalenjin and Kisii are broadcast from the new Kisumu station. Programmes in Swahili and Arabic, which are prepared by the Department of Information, are being transmitted from the new station at Mombasa. Both these new stations are on the air for five hours a day. The African Broadcasting Service, which has now moved into new permanent premises in Nairobi, will now only transmit programmes in Swahili.
and Kamba. These broadcasts are fed by land line to the Cable and Wireless station for transmission on medium and short wave transmitters owned by the Department of Information.

The Department has distributed several thousand radio sets to African listeners; the vernacular programmes are relayed by mobile vans in market places, etc., and wired broadcasting schemes are in operation in Nairobi and Nakuru.

There are at present 27,350 licensed receiving sets in use in Kenya.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. Many Africans in the Highlands also own forest plantations. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1954 are shown in the following table:

| Occupation                          | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|-------------------------------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing   | 220,807  | 626    | 1,549     |
| Mining and Quarrying                | 5,573    | 160    | 81        |

| **All Industries and Services**     | 492,551  | 32,734 | 18,478    |

In December, 1955, 18 employees’ and 7 employers’ unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total book membership was about 26,000.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops and products are sisal, coffee, tea, wattle extract, cotton, maize, wheat and pyrethrum.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an increasingly important role in the general agricultural policy of the Colony and considerable quantities of meat, butter, hides and skins, wool and bacon are produced annually. In addition there is considerable African production of millets, grains and pulses which often yield an exportable surplus.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony’s timber supplies—softwoods such as *Podocarpus* and pencil cedar and hardwoods such as East African olive and camphor. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and already provides some 18% of the annual softwoods production of the Colony, as well as considerable numbers of poles. The annual yield of mangrove poles from the coastal areas is in the region of 700,000.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and in Lake Victoria and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The chief minerals in order of value covering the year 1955 were soda ash, cement (from local minerals), salt, gold, mullite, limestone products, diatomite, carbonic acid gas and graphite. The total value of minerals won during 1955 was £2,707,531.

There are some 100 or so main types of manufacturing and industrial activity, producing goods for local consumption and export. The main productions for export are aluminium holloware, bacon and pork products, butter, canned foodstuffs, cheese, coffee, diatomite products, essential oils, gold, footwear, hydrogenated oils, kyanite, metal containers and tin cans, preserved fruits and fruit preparations, passion fruit juice and pulp, preserved vegetables, parquet flooring, paper products, pyrethrum extract, sisal products, soda ash, tea, tanned leather, wattle extract or bark, pencil slats. Fancy leather goods and native curios are made by individual craftsmen for local consumption and export.
