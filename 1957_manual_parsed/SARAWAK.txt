**Principal Towns**

| Town          | Approximate Population |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Kuching (capital) | 47,000                |
| Sibu          | 13,000                 |
| Miri          | 11,000                 |

| Simanggang    | 3,200                  |

Miri was almost entirely destroyed as a result of the war but reconstruction has now been completed.
Borneo Company, with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

The third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, succeeded his father in 1917, and progress continued in all spheres. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound economic position with large reserves. To celebrate the centenary, the Rajah enacted a new constitution, and set his people on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

During the Japanese occupation, social services and communications were neglected; education ceased; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State. After the surrender of Japan, the Australian forces entered Kuching on the 11th September, 1945, and Sarawak was for seven months administered by a British Military Administration, as a result of whose efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed and the medical and educational services reorganized. The Rajah resumed the administration of the State on the 15th April, 1946. It was, however, evident to him that greater resources and more technical and scientific experience were needed to restore to Sarawak her former prosperity. He therefore decided to hand the country over to the British Crown, and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May 1946 and passed by a small majority. By an Order in Council the State became a British Colony on the 1st July, 1946.

**Constitution**

Provision has recently been made by the Sarawak (Constitution) Order in Council, 1956, for the grant of a new Constitution to Sarawak under which the Council Negri (i.e. the Legislative Council) will have an overall majority of Elected Unofficial Members. There will be 24 Elected Members as against not more than 14 *ex officio* Members, four Nominated Members and three Standing Members who were elected for life prior to Cession. The Constitution also provides for the Supreme Council to discharge functions which in other territories are discharged by an Executive Council and which will include five members elected by the Elected Members of the Council Negri from among the Elected, Nominated or Standing Members of the Council Negri by secret ballot. The council Negri has power to provide by Ordinance, made pursuant to the Order in Council, for the holding of elections, direct or indirect, and for other connected matters. An Ordinance introduced in December, 1956 provides for Electoral Colleges and sub-electoral colleges, the final election to the Council Negri being made by Divisional Advisory Councils, Municipal and two Urban Councils. It is anticipated that Council Negri will be constituted for the first time in accordance with the new Constitution in April or May, 1957 and the Supreme Council shortly after that date.

The new Constitution revokes the provision of an Order of the Rajah made in 1941, as amended by subsequent Letters Patent, under the provisions of which the Government could command an official majority.

**Land Policy**

All the land in the Colony is classified under one of the following headings: mixed zones; native areas; native customary lands; interior areas; or reserved lands. Alienation to non-natives is permitted only in mixed zones which the Director of Lands and Surveys may create from time to time in areas of not more than 500 acres: any area in excess of 500 acres requires the approval of the Governor in Council. In native areas only natives of Sarawak may obtain rights to land. The interior areas consist mostly of virgin jungle and any land occupied there consists entirely of native farming lands lying away from the main centres of trade and plantation industry and only general administrative control is exercised. Land may be alienated in large or small holdings, but small holdings predominate and the policy is one of encouragement for the smallholder to own his land. During 1954 legislation was introduced to restrict severely the indiscriminate felling of virgin jungle. Schemes for land development on a large scale are being introduced.

**Taxation**

The only direct taxes levied on the native population by Government are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year, and the Malay "head tax" of $1 per year which is levied on all males of working age. These taxes are transferred to local authorities, where existent, who may in certain circumstances levy a cess of a similar amount on other indigenous races.

Income tax is levied on limited liability companies.

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 4,261,899   | 4,272,140       |
| 1950 | 30,170,617  | 16,536,527      |
| 1951 | 47,349,365  | 22,517,207      |
| 1952 | 54,266,009  | 28,724,480      |
| 1953 | 43,688,312  | 34,280,449      |
| 1954 | 43,800,621  | 33,264,706      |
| 1955 | 49,774,861  | 34,431,606      |

Approximately 57% of the revenue was derived from Customs import and export duties in 1955; other sources are excise duties, licences and taxes, which include income tax on limited liability companies, and revenue from Government property. The main heads of expenditure in 1955 were: Contribution to Development Fund $3,446,903; Constabulary $3,305,850; Medical $3,733,244; Administration $2,447,991; Public Works $3,054,284; Public Works Non-recurrent $2,441,279.

The Colony has no public debt.

**Currency**

By virtue of the Currency Ordinance, 1951, and Proclamation of November 1952, Sarawak currency ceased to be legal tender as from 31st December, 1952. Notes and coins might be exchanged thereafter only at a Sarawak Government Treasury. The legal tender in Sarawak is the notes and coins issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. The Malayan dollar = 2s. 4d. sterling.

**Development Plans**

Sarawak's Development Plan has been revised, covering the period 1955–60, and is estimated to cost $99,500,000 (£11,608,000). The Plan is to be financed by Colonial Development and Welfare...
grants, local revenue, appropriations, accumulated surplus balances and loan funds. The total provision is divided as follows:

|                | $       |
|----------------|---------|
| Agriculture    | 10,684,471 |
| Forestry       | 690,600   |
| Fisheries      | 158,720   |
| Communications | 54,226,683 |
| Fuel and Power | 1,515,500  |
| Education      | 5,086,000  |
| Medical and Health | 14,800,348 |
| Miscellaneous  | 12,244,209 |

The provision for Communications accounts for about 54% of the Plan and is to be spent on roads, port development, aviation, waterways and telecommunications.

Other Development

Industrial development is mainly in the hands of private enterprise, notably the oil industry. The Government has also spent about $85 million since 1947 on reconstruction and development.

Education

At the end of 1955 there were 571 schools in Sarawak, of which 34 provided secondary education. The number of children in school, which in 1947 was 29,616, had risen by the end of 1955 to 59,258, of whom 53,527 were at the primary stage and 6,271 at the secondary stage. Of the total enrolment, 41,825 were Chinese pupils. Schools are under the management of Government, Local Authorities, Christian Mission bodies, Committees of Management of Chinese Schools, and Village School Committees. In 1955 there were 43 students holding scholarships under various schemes studying overseas. Teacher-training is carried on at a single Centre at Batu Lintang, near Kuching, where teachers are trained for all types of schools. The principal scheme of community development is at Kanowit where young married couples from the indigenous peoples receive a two-year residential course which aims at improving their methods of agriculture and raising their general standards of living. Expansion of educational services since the end of the war has largely been made possible by the encouragement of "self-help" methods on the part of local communities, particularly with regard to the provision and maintenance of primary school buildings and furniture but a recent survey of the educational services has resulted in the recommendation that the central government should assume much greater financial responsibility for them. Estimated expenditure on education from public funds in 1955 was $1,568,124 of which $12,101 was contributed by the United Kingdom from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Sarawak Museum, at Kuching, is the only one in Borneo. Its research activities are largely concerned with the anthropology and ethnology of the country. Archaeological excavations are also in progress. The Public Library is housed in the Museum buildings; the British Council also maintain a library and reading room at Kuching and Sibu.

Health

Health and sanitation are good in the towns but in rural areas there is still a certain amount of malaria and other disease. An extensive malaria eradication scheme is in operation and it is hoped that by the end of 1957 this disease will be virtually non-existent in the whole country.

Beds available at Sarawak hospitals total about 700, including approximately 200 mental. A large new mental hospital is in course of construction near Kuching and considerable extensions to existing hospitals are also either in building or planned.

Outside the main centres there are 25 static dispensaries and 18 travelling dispensaries. A typical travelling dispensary is a small outboard boat which travels on a fixed itinerary along the river, stopping at centres of population and dispensing treatment and advice.

Maternity and child welfare services throughout the country are well advanced and in the town of Kuching, in 1955, 90% of all births were attended by members of the Government medical department.

The estimated expenditure of the Medical Department for the year 1956 was $4,167,129 for ordinary annual purposes and $4,857,299 from the development account for special work such as new buildings and the malaria eradication project. The total of $9,024,428 comprises more than 20% of the total Government expenditure.

Communications

There are two airfields, one at Kuching and the other at Sibu and there are feeder service airstrips at Bintulu and Lutong. Malayan Airways Limited operate five services weekly in each direction between Singapore, Kuching and North Borneo centres; three of these services call at Sibu.

The road system is not extensive, owing largely to the nature of the terrain. The total mileage is about 470, approximately 120 miles hard or gravelled surface, 80 miles metalled and 280 miles dry-weather earth roads and tracks.

The sea and rivers remain the chief means of surface communication. Regular coastal steamship services are maintained by the Sarawak Steamship Company and also a weekly service to and from Singapore and Kuching. The Straits Steamship Company have a regular service between Singapore, Miri, Brunei and British North Borneo ports, calling at Pending each way. The Rejang United Steamship Company also provide a cargo service between Singapore and the Rejang River. Various local shipping companies, mainly Chinese, ply up and down the main rivers and between coastal ports on limited voyages with a variety of launches and small, timber-built, powered craft carrying passengers and cargo.

Kuching is served by the Norwegian motor vessels Hervar and Henrik on a twice-monthly service to and from Hong Kong, mostly via British North Borneo ports. If inducement offers, one ship usually calls at Sibu. Occasionally, ships call at Kuching and Sibu from Bangkok with rice, maize and pickled vegetables.

Miri remains a fairly large oil exporting port and Tanjong Mani, in the Rejang river, exports timber to the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong by vessels of various lines.

The number and tonnage of overseas and neighbouring territories vessels calling at Sarawak ports (including vessels calling for timber, and oil tankers) in 1955 were: arrivals 3,484, tonnage 3,277,022; departures 3,362, tonnage 3,223,626 (whole Colony).
Broadcasting

Radio Sarawak, the Government broadcasting service, was inaugurated on 7th June, 1954, and broadcasts at strength 5 kW, in both the medium and short wave bands on one single transmission, with programmes in English, Malay, Mandarin and Iban (Sea Dayak). Studios, programme and administrative offices are at Broadcasting House in central Kuching. The transmitting station is about 1½ miles, and the receiver station 4½ miles, away. High quality medium wave coverage is given for a radius of 35 miles around Kuching and short wave reception is clear throughout the territories of British Borneo and in many other countries in the South-East Asian region.

Principal Occupations

Approximately 51% of the total population works at some gainful occupation and of these 45% are employed in some form of agriculture. The Chinese are to a large extent pepper and rubber planters. The Dayaks, Kayans and Kenyah are also farmers, employing primitive methods and engaged mainly in planting padi. The Melanaus, a coastal tribe, engage mainly in fishing and in working sago and timber. Approximate numbers employed in the principal industries are:

- Oilfields: 6,000
- Sawmills: 5,600
- Rubber Estates: 1,000
- Cutch: 400
- Jelutong: 300

Sago, arrack, biscuit and soap manufacturing, pottery, brick-making and gold-mining are the other principal industrial occupations; communications and transport and rubber-packing also employ considerable numbers.

Twenty-five trade unions, with a total membership of 4,233 were registered in 1955.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural export products are rubber, sago, pepper and copra. Padi, tapioca, maize, coffee, fruit and vegetables are grown for local consumption. (Local padi production is inadequate to meet local demands for rice, the staple diet, and there are considerable imports of rice.)

Animal husbandry plays only a small part at present in the rural economy. Pigs are kept by the Chinese and Dayaks and this aspect is developing. There are some cattle and buffaloes but they are mainly confined to the north.

Both marine and freshwater fisheries are of considerable importance, but production is inadequate to meet local needs and there are considerable imports of dried, salted and tinned fish.

The Colony's mineral products are oil, gold, coal, antimony, mercury, diamonds, limestone, clay used for bricks and tiles, building stone and phosphate. Oil and gold have received the closest examination but, in common with the other minerals, a large amount of work remains to be carried out before their potentials are known.

The only major industry is the refining of oil. There are many small factories processing rural products scattered throughout the more accessible parts of the country—particularly padi mills and rubber smokehouses; sago factories are mainly confined to the sago-growing areas. There are 58 licensed sawmills, a match factory, a catch factory, a vegetable oil factory, a jelutong refinery, and three distilleries using the products of the nipah palm; all these are privately owned.

| 1955  | 442,347,927 | 477,460,040 |

Principal Exports by Volume and Value

|       | 1938 | 1954 | 1955 |
|-------|------|------|------|
| Rubber | tons | 17,988 | 23,188 | 39,411 |
| Pepper | tons | 3,013 | 15,465 | 16,297 |
| Sago Flour | tons | 15,213 | 12,543 | 9,871 |
| Copra | tons | 3,594 | 2,994 | 1,575 |
| Timber | tons | n.a. | 197,376 | 210,043 |
| Mineral Oil(a) | tons | 897 | 4,664 | 5,129 |

(a) Crude oil is piped to the refinery in Sarawak from the adjoining territory of Brunei, and constitutes most of the output. Crude oil from wells in Sarawak (70,190 tons in 1954 and 65,614 tons in 1955) is also treated at the same refinery and both crude and refined petroleums are included in the total exports.

In 1955 42·34% of domestic exports went to Singapore, 15·93% to other British Colonies, 1·02% to Brunei, 9·62% to the United Kingdom and 31·09% to other countries.

In the same year 66·21% of imports originated in Brunei (crude oil for refining, which is re-exported), 4·58% originated in Singapore, 5·19% originated in other British Commonwealth countries, 9·45% originated in the United Kingdom, and 14·57% originated in other countries.

The chief imports, other than oil from Brunei, are foodstuffs, textiles, tobacco, beverages, and manufactured goods.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing boards or statutory marketing organizations. Government provided facilities for the purchase of padi at a fixed floor price throughout the country. Control over the standard grading of sago and pepper for export was also exercised by Government.

Co-operative development was started in 1949 and has made steady progress. By 31st August, 1955, there were 143 co-operative societies on the Register engaged in the following business:

- Marketing Vegetables 1; Padi Saving 33; Padi Milling 22; Consumers Stores 20; Credit Societies 62; miscellaneous 3; Secondary Societies (including Bank) 2.

These societies were distributed through the First, Second, Third and Fourth Divisions and were composed of Malays, Melanaus, Land Dayaks, Sea Dayaks, Kenyahs, Kayans and Chinese. The Co-operative Development Department is expanding in accordance with the extension of co-operative activity, which is, however, somewhat impeded by difficulties of communication and illiteracy in rural areas.
