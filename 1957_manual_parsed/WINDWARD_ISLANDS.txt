THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

Area
The total area of the Islands is 826 square miles.

Population
At the end of 1955 the total population was about 316,229. The majority are of the negro race; less than 5% are white. There are a few persons of East Indian descent, and a few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent and Dominica.

Principal Towns
The capitals of the four colonies are:

| Colony          | Estimated Population in 1955 |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Grenada—St. George's (residence of Governor) | 5,606                        |
| Dominica—Roseau | 13,000                       |
| St. Lucia—Castries | 25,000                     |
| St. Vincent—Kingstown | 6,338                   |

Geographical Features
The islands are of volcanic origin and the more sheltered coasts are fringed by reefs. Torrential streams from the more rugged areas tend to lose their gradient nearer the coast and the deposition of their sediments has led to the formation of fertile river flats and occasional river terraces. The residual clays on the rugged volcanic areas are comparatively fertile. One of the volcanoes in the Windward region (St. Vincent) was active in 1902. At the Soufrières of Dominica and St. Lucia and in parts of Grenada hot sulphuretted gases still emerge and there are numerous hot springs which contain salts.

Climate
The prevailing trade winds provide a delightful climate; there is little variation between night and day.

History
As early as 1763 one Governor was appointed for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776; and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government. On 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad. On 1st January, 1940, Dominica was included in the Windward Islands.

Constitution and Administration
Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada, where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the Chief Justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established in 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889. In March, 1956, revised constitutions were introduced in each of the four islands.

Land Policy
There is a small amount of Crown land reserved mainly for purposes of forest and water conservation. There is no restriction on the transfer of land except to aliens, for which the consent of the Governor in Executive Council is necessary.

Currency
The currency comprises dollar notes ($1 = 4s. 2d.) and British coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, and Trinidad) in currency unification.

Legislation has been enacted in the Windward Islands to provide for the reciprocal legal tender of currency notes of the Government of Jamaica and the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean.

Development
Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955 the Windward Islands received an allocation of £3,250,000. This was sub-allocated to the various colonies as follows:

| Colony | £       |
|--------|---------|
| St. Lucia | 1,130,000 |
| Dominica | 820,000   |
| Grenada | 540,000   |
| St. Vincent | 540,000 |

A sum of £220,000 was reserved by the Governor for schemes covering more than one territory and for unforeseen contingencies.

Libraries, Museums, etc.
In each of the principal towns of the four Islands of the Group there is a free public library and there are several branch libraries throughout the Islands, all maintained by Government. The Dominica Museum, the only one in the Windward Islands, possesses a fine collection of pictures, specimens of birds and fishes and relics of the original Caribs.

Health
The principal diseases are malaria, enteric fever, helminthic diseases, yaws, venereal diseases, pulmonary tuberculosis and dysentery.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, in co-operation with the World Health Organization, have made grants towards the implementation of insect control programmes in St. Lucia and Grenada. Applications have been submitted for the carrying out of similar projects in Dominica and St. Vincent.

Communications
Airfields have been constructed in Grenada and St. Lucia, and these two colonies are served by British West Indian Airways on a regular schedule. A temporary service with Grumman Goose...
amphibian aircraft is operated by the St. Vincent Government between Trinidad, Grenada, Carriacou, Barbados, St. Vincent and Dominica.

Broadcasting

The Windward Islands Broadcasting Service, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, was inaugurated in 1955. Transmissions take place on short-waves from a 5-kW transmitter, and cover all four Islands.

The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

DOMINICA

Area and Population

The area is approximately 305 square miles, and the estimated population is 63,000.

Geographical Features

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island. The island is well-watered.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good; during the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd July, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1761, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

Until 1940 Dominica was grouped with the Leeward Islands.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council is the "principal instrument of policy" and the Governor and Administrator will normally accept the Council's advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote.
Since the President has a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and Works;
The Minister for Social Services;
each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any member of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 2d. to 10s. in the £ of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 6s. on every £ of chargeable income. Ad valorem duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 5% to 35% preferential and 3% to 75% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on most products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue $000 B.W.I. | Expenditure $000 B.W.I. |

| 1955 | 3,271             | 3,374                  |

Of the total revenue in 1955 $1,268,318 was derived from Customs, $299,494 from Taxes and $125,802 from Fees of Court, etc.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Education $290,545, Medical $272,863, Police $216,186, Public Works Department $598,581. Prior to 1940 Governor, Legislature, Audit and Judicial were borne by the Federal Government, Leeward Islands.

Development Plans

The Colony has been allocated $3,715,776 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945 for the ten year period ended 31st March 1956 as well as a further sum of $3,936,000 under the 1955 Act in respect of the five-year period 1st April 1955 to 31st March 1960. Development Schemes fall into six main headings as follows:

- Agriculture and Forestry.
- Public Works.
- Education.
- Medical.
- Social Welfare.
- Miscellaneous.

In addition to the above, the Colony is engaged upon a programme of Public Works amounting to £405,000 financed from Loan Funds as set out below:

- Ferro-concrete Jetty at Roseau $321,600
- Goodwill Housing Scheme (Town expansion and slum clearance) $177,600

A fair proportion of the Development and Welfare Funds allocated to Agriculture, Education, and Medical programmes is for building construction undertaken by the Public Works Department.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation is engaged on development of Melville Hall Estate, in the northern part of the island. They completed the construction of a hydro-electric plant near Roseau in 1953.

Education

There are 47 Elementary Schools with a total enrolment of 11,571 pupils, and four Secondary Schools with an enrolment of 865 pupils. There are also eight private or temporary schools with an enrolment of 668 pupils. There is no technical school nor any local institution of Higher Education. The number of students from this Colony known to be in Universities or University Colleges abroad is:

- United Kingdom 26
- Canada 4
- Jamaica (University College of the West Indies) 10
- Trinidad (I.C.T.A.) 2
- France 1
- Belgium 1

In 1955 Government expenditure on Education was $290,545 as compared with $35,976 in 1935.

Health

There are four Government hospitals, including a Leprosy Home, with a total of 183 beds. The latest available annual figure for out-patients is 7,262 and for in-patients 2,753. Regular clinics are held throughout the year by District Medical Officers at the 20 dispensaries distributed all over...
the island. A Maternal, Child Hygiene and School Health Service with its Headquarters in Roseau is operated by a Senior Health Visitor, assisted by five Health Visitors, under the direction of the Senior Medical Officer. As part of its functions the clinic distributes free milk, cod liver oil and food yeast to needy and undernourished children. Under a U.N.I.C.E.F. school feeding programme, all children in primary and secondary schools receive a pint of reconstituted milk daily. There are also an Anti-Yaws Campaign and a Dental Service.

The Health Department with its auxiliary the Public Health Engineering Unit is under the control of the Senior Medical Officer who is also Chairman of the Central Board of Health. This Board is statutorily constituted and is responsible to Government for the initiation and carrying out of public health measures.

Government expenditure on medical and allied services in 1955 was $272,863 compared with $19,243 in 1936.

Communications

The amphibian aircraft of the St. Vincent Government service use Soufrière Bay.

Sailing and motor vessels connect Dominica with most of the smaller West Indian islands.

The following steamship lines call at Roseau: Canadian National, Harrison, Alcoa, Furness Withy, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique and Royal Netherlands Steamships Limited.

There are 100 miles of oiled surface roads, 250 miles of secondary roads and 325 miles of tracks. An extensive programme of road development is being carried out.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture is the principal occupation and provides employment for about 5,000 wage-earners in addition to about 3,000 peasants. Road and building construction workers are estimated at 2,000. There are two trade unions with an estimated membership of 5,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are limes, bananas, coconuts, grapefruit, oranges, cocoa, vanilla, mangoes, avocado pears and various ground provisions for domestic use. The main products are raw and sweetened lime juice, lime oil, copra and rum.

The livestock population consists of about 4,000 head of cattle. A Government stock farm has been established in order to stimulate expansion of the livestock industry.

There is considerable production of timber for local use, but no export trade.

The production of handicrafts from local straws is a widespread minor industry. The annual value of production is estimated at $36,000.

The chief imports are food, drink and tobacco, textiles, machinery and metal manufactures.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

All fresh fruit for export beyond the Caribbean area is required by law to be packed at a licensed packing house. The Government Fruit Packing and Marketing Dépot continues to offer facilities for marketing abroad of citrus and other fruit. In 1955 there were the following co-operative societies operating:

- Thirteen Credit Unions with 3,293 members;
- Two Marketing and Processing Societies (Lime Juice and Lime Oil) with 160 members. These did not operate during 1956 owing to difficulties of marketing the products in which they deal.

GRENADE

Area

The total area of the Colony is 133 square miles. In addition to the island of Grenada it includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.

Population

The estimated population (mid-1955) of 88,215 is for the most part “coloured”. There is a small white population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Geographical Features

In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon’s Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate

Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month, and November the wettest.

History

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of 1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from the French West India Company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George’s. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the French Company and passed to the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795–96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. Many atrocities were committed, including the cold-blooded murder of the Lieutenant-Governor. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council is recognised as the “principal instrument of policy” and the Governor and Administrator normally accept the Council’s advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three ex officio members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor’s absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote. Since the President has a casting vote only and whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:
   The Minister for Trade and Production;
   The Minister for Communications and Works;
   The Minister for Social Services;
each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.
The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any members of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two ex officio members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

Taxation

Forms of direct taxation include income tax, estate duties and land and house tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale of 3 cents to 65 cents in the $ for individuals, companies paying a special rate of 37½ cents in the $. An agreement was reached in 1949 with various Governments for the avoidance of double taxation. Taxation is enforced in other forms through import, export and excise duties, licences, etc.

Development Plans

Under the 1945 and 1950 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts Grenada received allocations totalling £591,121; a further allocation of £540,000 was made under the 1955 Act. By 31st March 1956 some £497,000 of the total of £1,131,000 had been committed to approved schemes, the balance being earmarked for the following services:

- Contribution to Hurricane Rehabilitation Programme: £312,500
- Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries: £133,000
- Medical and Health (including water supplies): £129,000
- Education: £37,000
- Miscellaneous: £22,500

Total: £634,000

A loan of $1,540,800 was raised in 1952 for the execution of the following projects:

- Civil Servants Housing: $149,564
- Electricity: $200,000
- Grenville Jetty: $19,089
- Hospitals: $148,783
- Morne Rouge Development: $215,359

- Water Supplies: $150,699
- Port Works: $171,949
- Expenses of Loan: $40,304

Total: $1,540,800

Other Development

It has not so far been possible to attract the assistance of any organization of suitable capacity by way of investing in any desirable major development scheme at present beyond the competence of the Colony to finance. One such scheme is the development of the Morne Rouge area in the interest of tourism.

Education

There are 54 Primary Schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 19,104. Average attendance in 1955 was 14,338 or 75%. Compulsory attendance is enforced in the capital and one other area where accommodation is regarded as adequate. Eleven of the Primary Schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned buildings of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are three handicraft centres. In addition two schools have well-equipped handicraft rooms. There are also three domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at two other schools. A visual education unit serves the whole colony. A filmstrip library service with four projectors is maintained. Six Secondary Schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,307. Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys’ Secondary School, the Presentation College, the St. Joseph’s Convent and Anglican High School also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The estimated cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1955 was $514,421. In 1935 the total expenditure on education amounted to $73,080.

The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a university in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad.

Health

A WHO-UNICEF assisted Campaign for the eradication of *Aedes aegypti* which has been in operation for the past two years is well on the way to complete success. This Campaign has also substantially reduced the incidence of malaria. WHO-UNICEF also assisted with a B.C.G. vaccination campaign throughout the island in 1954, with a follow up in 1955; also with a scheme for the supplementary feeding of children and expectant and nursing mothers.

One medical officer is engaged in a yaws and venereal disease campaign.

The Colony Hospital of 200 beds is at St. George’s. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew’s, is a modern building, recently constructed, and provides 32 beds. The district hospital at Carriacou was completely destroyed by the hurricane of 22nd September, 1955. Plans have been prepared for its replacement by a hospital of 32 beds.
There are 23 district Medical Visiting Stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Maternity and child welfare work is carried on in all these Stations. There are two main Health Centres at St. George's and Gouyave, and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Estimated expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1955 amounted to $697,373, compared with $97,987 in 1935.

Communications

The airfield is at Pearls, and has a runway 5,280 feet long and 150 feet wide.

There are approximately 472 miles of good roads divided into four classes according to standard of construction. About 234 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief ports are St. George's (possessing a good harbour though reconstruction of the deep-water pier destroyed by the hurricane of September 1955, will not begin until early 1957), Grenville and Hillsborough (Carriacou). Cargo services are operated by the Harrison Line steamers from the United Kingdom and by calls of the Canadian National Steamship Company and the Alcoa Line from Canadian and United States ports. The Canadian National Line and Caribbean Fruit Company boats also carry passengers. Several small motor, auxiliary and sailing vessels ply regularly between the islands.

Principal Occupations

The following is a summary of gainfully-employed labour for 1955:

Agriculture—

(a) Field Workers : 5,400
(b) Spice Curing Stations : 600
(c) Sugar production (factory):

In Season : 100
Out Season : 50

The approximate livestock population is:

Cattle 7,500
Equines 6,000
Sheep and Goats 9,000
Pigs 7,500
Poultry 80,500

There is a cigarette factory, a soap and edible fats factory, and a sugar factory producing unrefined sugar for local consumption. The sugar factory also operates a continuous rum-distilling plant and together with a number of estates equipped with pot stills, supplies the demand for uncured rum. A lime factory and two estate equipped lime stills deal with the Island's lime crop. There is also a Government-operated cotton ginnery in Carriacou.

Principal Exports by Volume and Value ($ B.W.I.)

| Item          | Volume | Value   |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| Cocoa (raw)   | cwt.   | $       |
| Nutmegs      | cwt.   | $       |
| Mace          | cwt.   | $       |
| Bananas      | stems  | $       |
| Cotton (raw)  | cwt.   | $       |
| Copra        | cwt.   | $       |
| Lime oil     | lb.    | $       |
| Nutmeg oil   | lb.    | $       |
| Cotton seed  | cwt.   | $       |

Nutmeg estates, coconut trees, breadfruit trees and bananas suffered heavy damage and destruction in the hurricane in September, 1955, and the effect of the hurricane will be felt for many years to come. An estimated 95% of the nutmegs were destroyed and most of the cocoa entirely stripped of leaves, flowers and fruit. As nutmegs and cocoa are the major export crops, the magnitude of Grenada's long-term problem becomes apparent.

The chief imports are foodstuffs, iron and steel, timber, textiles and cement.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.

Six co-operatives were registered in 1954, and there are a number of small co-operative societies and two estate buying clubs in operation.

ST. LUCIA

Area and Population

The area is 238 square miles and the population 88,150 (1955 end-year estimate).

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest-clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September—October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

The date and the person who discovered St. Lucia are unknown, for according to the known evidence of Columbus's voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April, 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops,
12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June, 1803, was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

**Constitution**

A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial system came into force in March, 1956. This follows the lines of those already in force in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main features are:

(a) The Executive Council is the “principal instrument of policy” and the Governor and Administrator normally accept the Council’s advice unless they deem it expedient to do otherwise in the interests of public faith, public order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided over by the Governor of the Windward Islands when he is in the Colony, comprises three *ex officio* members (the Administrator, who presides in the Governor’s absence, the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one nominated member from among the nominated members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor; and four members, being elected members of the Legislative Council and chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected members. There may also be, at the discretion of the Council, one member, being a person holding a public office in the Colony, styled the official member; he, however, has no vote. Since the President has a casting vote only and, whenever the Governor is present the Administrator has no original vote, the elected members thus have a voting majority on Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by the Governor in Council:

- The Minister for Trade and Production;
- The Minister for Communications and Works;
- The Minister for Social Services;

each of whom is responsible for a number of subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains with the Governor through the Financial Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc., of any member of the Civil Service is the sole responsibility of the Administrator and Governor, advised by a non-political Public Service Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising the Administrator, two *ex officio* members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary); three nominated unofficial members; and eight elected members. The Administrator is President of the Council, and there is a Deputy President appointed from among the nominated and elected members of the Council; the presiding member has a casting vote only. The Governor may address the Council at any time he thinks fit. Election of members to the Legislative Council is on the basis of universal adult suffrage.

**Taxation**

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 8d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | $453,528 | $504,984    |
| 1951 | $4,448,832 | $4,244,218 |

**Education**

In the 1954–55 session there were two students from St. Lucia at the University College of the West Indies, Jamaica. There were 23 students at Universities in the United Kingdom, nine in Canada and three in France. Of these five held Government scholarships, the balance being private students. There were two Secondary
Schools with 655 pupils on the roll, and 51 Primary Schools with a total of 16,230 pupils enrolled. The Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies conducted adult education classes throughout the year, and the aggregate attendance was 1,435. The total expenditure for 1955 was $328,210, compared with $32,122 in 1935.

**Health**

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases, and venereal diseases.

The incidence of malaria has fallen sharply as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

Available hospital beds amount to 120. There are 15 dispensaries and Health Outposts and a Day Nursery.

In 1955, 51,788 persons attended at clinics or health outposts and there were 4,218 admissions to hospitals. The expenditure on medical and allied services in 1955 was $292,714, compared with $55,795 in 1935.

**Communications**

There are two airfields, the Vigie Airport, and the Beane Field Airport. Air services with the other islands are maintained by British West Indian Airways Incorporated, and chartered flights by K.L.M. and British Guiana Airways. The island's road system comprises the following:

| Roads          | Miles |
|----------------|-------|
| Main roads     | 111-92|
| Second Class Roads | 95-90 |
| Unclassified Roads | 170-60|
| Total          | 378-42|

Cargo steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, Alcoa Steamships, the Harrison Line, the Geast Industrica Company and numerous inter-island craft are the main means of communication by sea. Castries handles about 945,000 gross tons of shipping annually.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture (18,000). Other gainful occupations are fishing (1,500), manufacturing (3,830), public services (2,100), lumbering (221), transportation (1,800), commerce (2,160), and domestic service (2,100).

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are sugar cane, bananas, coconuts, cocoa, cassava, fruit, vegetables, rice, cotton, and citrus.

Livestock estimates are: cattle 15,000, pigs 20,000, sheep 9,000, goats 7,000, horses, mules and donkeys 1,500, poultry 45,000.

Estimated timber extraction was 500,000 board feet.

There is a fair amount of fishing, but the supply does not meet the demand.

The principal manufactures are sugar, rum, citrus products, edible oils, cotton ginning, cigarettes, and mineral waters.

ST. VINCENT

Area
The total area of the Colony, together with the
St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population
The estimated population at the end of 1955
was 76,778.

Geographical Features
Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent
is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufrière
(4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length
of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A
backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending
along the main axis divides the island into
windward and leeward districts. The area under
forest is approximately 87 square miles. None of
the rivers are navigable.

Climate
Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an
extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade.
At Kingstown, 60 feet above sea level, the mean
temperature was 85·8°, and the rainfall 104·17
inches, in 1953.

History
St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in
1498. It was included in a patent given by
Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660
England and France agreed that the Island should
be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to
Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first
people of African origin arrived. They were a
number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines,
who eventually reached St. Vincent, and inter-
married with the Carib inhabitants. Later,
French settlements were made along the leeward
coast including the site of the present capital,
Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent
was declared neutral, but was captured by the
British fourteen years later in 1762. After the con-
clusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began
to arrive. During the American War of Independ-
ence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and
St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in
1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles
in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution
A new Constitution incorporating the Ministerial
system came into force in March, 1956. This
follows the lines of those already in force in
Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. The main
features are:

(a) The Executive Council is the "principal
instrument of policy" and the Governor and
Administrator normally accept the Council's
advice unless they deem it expedient to do
otherwise in the interests of public faith, public
order and good government.

(b) The Executive Council, normally presided
over by the Governor of the Windward Islands
when he is in the Colony, comprises three ex
officio members (the Administrator, who
presides in the Governor's absence, the Crown
Attorney and the Financial Secretary); one
nominated member from among the nominated
members of the Legislative Council appointed
by the Governor; and four members, being
elected members of the Legislative Council and
chosen by the Legislative Council, styled elected
members. There may also be, at the discretion
of the Council, one member, being a person
holding a public office in the Colony, styled the
official member; he, however, has no vote.
Since the President has a casting vote only
and whenever the Governor is present the
Administrator has no original vote, the elected
members will thus have a voting majority on
Executive Council.

(c) There are three Ministers, appointed by
the Governor in Council:
The Minister for Trade and Production;
The Minister for Communications and
Works;
The Minister for Social Services;
each of whom is responsible for a number of
subjects.

Full responsibility for financial matters remains
with the Governor through the Financial
Secretary.

The appointment, retirement, discipline, etc.,
of any member of the Civil Service is the sole
responsibility of the Administrator and Governor,
advised by a non-political Public Service
Commission.

There is a Legislative Council, comprising
the Administrator, two ex officio members (the
Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary);
three nominated unofficial members; and
eight elected members. The Administrator is
President of the Council, and there is a Deputy
President appointed from among the nominated
and elected members of the Council; the
presiding member has a casting vote only. The
Governor may address the Council at any time
he thinks fit. Election of members to the
Legislative Council is on the basis of universal
adult suffrage.
Taxation

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 65 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 37½ cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 18s. 2d. per proof gallon.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue B.W.I. | Expenditure B.W.I. |
|------|---------------|--------------------|
| 1938 | 489,677       | 464,458            |
| 1951 | 2,183,392     | 2,317,061          |
| 1952 | 2,113,384     | 2,105,005          |
| 1953 | 2,790,712     | 2,618,773          |
| 1954 | 3,061,693     | 2,846,026          |
| 1955 | 3,327,388     | 3,312,885          |

In 1955 Customs and Excise duties produced $1,375,412 (or 41·04%) of the total revenue while direct taxation yielded $355,534 (or 10·69%).

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Medical: $442,542
- Education: $362,634
- Police: $185,132

The Public Debt at 31st December 1955, was $679,854, equivalent to $8·85 per head of the population.

Development Plans

The Ten-Year Development Plan, compiled in 1946, has been revised and replaced by the Five-Year Plan, 1955–60. It is hoped that the sum of £360,000 will be made available from public loans, and some £600,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare funds (including a further allocation of £540,000 under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act). These funds will be spent in the following proportions:

- Communications: 65%
- Social Services: 24%
- Economic Development: 11%

Education

In 1955 there were two Government Secondary Schools and one grant-aided Secondary School with an enrolment of 590 pupils and 43 Primary Schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 16,895 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Three Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 163 pupils.

During 1954–55 some 32 St. Vincent students were attending Universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1955 expenditure on educational services amounted to $362,634, of which the contribution of the United Kingdom under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $2,847. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

Health

Of tropical diseases yaws is prevalent, and tuberculosis is a major health problem but does not appear to be increasing (average deaths over a five-year period were 53 annually). Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 20 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery): 134
- Maternity: 16
- Tuberculosis: 40
- Mental: 100
- Leprosy: 20
- Pauper Home: 125

In 1955 in-patients numbered 5,041; out-patients, 9,350.

Total expenditure in 1955 on Government Health and Medical Services was $453,983; in 1935, $66,945.

Communications

The seadrome is situated at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown.

There are about 400 miles of roads of which some 120 miles are motorable throughout the year; 63 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 37 miles of metalled roads and about 325 miles of earth roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo service is provided from Canada, by the Canadian National Steamship Company, with limited passenger accommodation. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service every six weeks by the Harrison Line. The Alcoa Steamships call southbound from Canada fortnightly via the islands and proceed to New York approximately every five weeks. The Caribbean Fruit Company have recently started a passenger and cargo service which operates between Trinidad, Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Barbados. Schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Principal Occupations

The working population is estimated to be some 31,000, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

Trade Unions

| Trade Union                                      | Membership |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| The United Workers’, Peasants’ and Ratepayers’ Union | 1,100      |
| The General Workers’ Union                       | 50         |
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers’ Union | 2,500      |
| The Civil Service Association                    | —          |
| The Teachers’ Association                        | 300        |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are arrowroot, cotton, copra and coconut, sugar, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, bananas and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 11,000; cattle 7,750; sheep 3,300; horses and mules 250; swine 9,400.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

There is fairly extensive fishing in-shore but very little is done off-shore. Catches are often insufficient to meet demand.

A Central Arrowroot Factory with modern equipment has been erected. There are a good many privately-owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a soap and cigarette factory; an oil expressing and refining...
plant for cotton seed and coconut oil, with their by-products of stock feed and manure; a bacon and ham factory, and a deodorizing plant for the treatment of coconut and fish oils at the Government Cotton Ginney; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks.
