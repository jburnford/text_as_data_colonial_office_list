THE GOLD COAST (GHANA)

The Gold Coast, while remaining within the British Commonwealth, attained independence on the 6th March 1957 and took the name of Ghana. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations will in future be the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government and the Government of Ghana.

Basic information about the territory will be found in the 1956 edition of the Colonial Office List.
