BRITISH GUIANA

Area

British Guiana lies on the north-east coast of the South American Continent. Its area is 83,000 square miles, divided into three counties as follows:

| County       | Square miles |
|--------------|-------------|
| Essequibo    | 61,660      |
| Berbice      | 16,920      |
| Demerara     | 4,420       |

Population

At 31st December, 1955, the population was 492,980, comprising the following racial groups—

| Race                  | Population |
|-----------------------|------------|
| East Indians          | 230,840    |
| African descent       | 171,960    |
| Mixed descent (Coloured) | 55,260   |

| Europeans other than Portuguese | 4,130 |
| Chinese               | 3,320      |
| Amerindians           | 19,400     |

Principal Towns

The City of Georgetown, Demerara, is the capital and has a population of 116,000. New Amsterdam, Berbice, has a population of 13,500.

Geographical Features

The Colony may be divided into three zones, viz., the low-lying coastal region, the mountain region and the intermediate region. The coastal region comprises a low-lying, swampy strip of marine alluvium which varies in width from about ten miles in the west to about 40 miles in the east. Its flat, grassy savannahs would mostly be inundated during the rainy season but for artificial drainage and sea defences. Almost the whole of the population and agricultural activity of the Colony is concentrated between the Pomeroon River and Corentyne River along this strip. The mountain region, known as the Pakaraima Range, lies along the western boundary of the Colony. Mount Roraima, a plateau 22 square miles in extent and over 9,000 feet above sea level, is the highest elevation. The intermediate region, the largest area of the Colony, lies mainly to the east and south. It is almost entirely forest clad. The total area under forest is approximately 70,000 square miles.

There are many large rivers which with their numerous tributaries form a vast network of waterways. All the large rivers are impeded above the tideway by rapids, cataracts and falls. Kaieteur, one of the largest single-drop waterfalls in the world, is situated on the Potaro River. It is nearly five times the height of Niagara and has a vertical drop of 741 feet with a further 80 feet of rapids and falls. Its width varies from 350 to 400 feet.

The Climate is pleasant for the greater part of the year; it is hot only in the summer months. The mean temperature is 80·3° (82·6° in the interior). There are two wet and two dry seasons in the coastal regions—the long wet season usually from April to August and the long dry season from September to mid-November. This is followed by wet weather until the end of January, and the short dry season until April. The rainfall average is about 90 inches in the coastal belt and 59 inches in the savannahs of the interior where the dry season is October to February and the wet season May to August. The nights are uniformly cool.

Slight earth tremors are felt occasionally, but no damage is caused.

History

There have been some discrepancies in dates and other matters in the various historical accounts but the following brief statement is based upon what is taken to be the most authentic version.

In history there are really five Guianas—Spanish Guiana (now Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now Brazil), Dutch Guiana (now Surinam), French Guiana and British Guiana. A navigable river was so important to the Europeans who first visited the coastline between the Amazon and the Orinoco that they gave the Amerindian name of the river to the surrounding countryside. Thus the three counties of British Guiana are Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice, and the areas known as Rupununi, Mazaruni, Potaro, Cuyuni, Pomeroon and Corentyne take their names from the rivers that flow through them. Guiana is an Amerindian word meaning "Land of Waters."

The coastline of the country between the Amazon and Orinoco was first traced by Spanish sailors in 1499 and 1500 and the first European settlements were almost certainly Spanish or Portuguese. The Dutch established a settlement on the Pomeroon in 1581 but were evicted by Spanish and Indians (probably in 1596) and retired to Kyk-over-al up the Essequibo. In 1627 Dutch merchants settled on the Berbice. The Dutch West Indian Company, formed in 1621, controlled these settlements.

The first English attempt at settlement in the area lasted from 1604–06, on the Oyapock River (now French Guiana). Fresh ventures in 1609 and 1629 failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, founded a settlement in Surinam in 1651 but this was captured by the Dutch in 1667. In October of the same year it was recaptured by a British expedition from Barbados, the leaders being unaware of the signing of the Treaty of Breda in the previous July. It was mid-1668 before the Dutch finally obtained possession of Surinam in accordance with the terms of that Treaty. In effect Surinam was exchanged for New York, though this was not explicit in the terms of the Treaty.
The Dutch retained their hold on the territory with more or less firmness, now yielding to England and now to France or Portugal, until 1796 when during the war of the French Revolution it was captured by a British fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain and finally ceded to her in 1814, exclusive of Surinam.

**Constitution**

A new and advanced form of Constitution with universal adult suffrage at the age of 21, a two Chamber Legislature and a ministerial system, based on the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission of 1950-51, was brought into effect in 1953 by an Order of the Queen in Council dated 1st April, 1953, made under the British Guiana Act, 1928, and a General Election was held on the 27th April. As a result of subsequent developments it was announced on the 9th October that Her Majesty's Government had decided that the Constitution must be suspended to prevent Communist subversion of the Government and a dangerous crisis both in public order and in economic affairs.

A Constitutional Commission was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Chairmanship of Sir James Robertson, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., with Sir Donald Jackson, Chief Justice of the Windward and Leeward Islands, and Mr. George Woodcock, C.B.E., Assistant General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, as members. Its terms of reference were: "In the light of the circumstances which made it necessary to suspend the Constitution of British Guiana to consider and to recommend what changes are required in it".

The Commission's report was published on the 2nd November, 1954, and Her Majesty's Government announced their acceptance of its recommendation for a period of "marking time" in the advance towards self-government. In the meantime the affairs of the Colony continue to be administered in accordance with the British Guiana (Constitution) (Temporary Provisions) Order in Council dated 22nd December, 1953. This provides for an Executive Council of three *ex officio* Members and not more than seven Nominated Members; and a Legislative Council of a Speaker, the same three *ex officio* Members and not more than twenty-four Nominated Members.

New constitutional proposals provide for a Legislative Council of not more than 28 members (excluding the Speaker) consisting of three *ex officio* members, not less than 14 elected members and not more than 11 nominated members. At the first elections to be held under the amended constitution, the number of members to be elected will be 14. The Executive Council will consist of three *ex officio* members, two nominated and five elected members of the Legislative Council.

**Land Policy**

Land in the Colony falls within three categories—

(i) Freehold: *(a)* alienated by the Dutch prior to 1803; *(b)* alienated by the Crown;

(ii) Crown land—about 90% of the area of the Colony;

(iii) Colony land, acquired from private owners and the Crown for public purposes.

Crown land may be alienated or leased to any individual with the consent of the Governor; in the case of Colony land with the consent of the Governor in Council. Absentee lessees must have a legal representative in the Colony. Alienation of Crown land is restricted to leases for periods not exceeding 99 years. The sale of Crown land has been suspended, but in very special circumstances small areas may still be bought.

**Taxation**

The main heads of taxation are Customs, excise and licences, income tax, stamp duties, estate duties, acreage tax, duty on transport and mortgages.

Income tax rates range from 6 cents (for the first $1,200 (£250)) to 60 cents on each $ of chargeable income in the case of individuals. Companies, other than Life Insurance companies, pay 45%; Life Insurance companies 15%.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue* | Expenditure* |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1938 | £1,302,519 | £1,312,177 |
| 1951 | £5,249,766 | £5,161,659 |
| 1952 | £6,219,875 | £5,929,044 |
| 1953 | £6,725,726 | £6,540,307 |
| 1954 | £7,537,829 | £7,192,757 |
| 1955 | £8,853,763 | £8,336,670 |

* Total Colony revenue and expenditure.

In 1955, 28·51% of revenue came from Income Tax while Customs and Excise produced 46·67%. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

Social Services ... £2,566,134

Administration including

Law and Order ... £1,871,955

Public Works ... £1,021,376

Economic Development ... £777,565

The Public Debt at the end of 1955 was £7,272,294.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is (1) the new unified currency notes and coins issued by the Currency Board of the British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) brought into circulation on 1st August, 1951 and 15th November, 1955 respectively; (2) note circulation of the two Joint Stock Banks, Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) and Royal Bank of Canada, being gradually withdrawn; (3) United Kingdom silver and copper coins and local silver coins (4d.) being gradually withdrawn. The currency is exchangeable with sterling at par. The unit of currency is the $ = 4s. 2d. sterling; £ = $4·80.

**Development Plans**

A Two-year Development Programme, 1954-55, was launched early in 1954. Expenditure ($9 million in 1954 and $16 million in 1955), fell short of the estimate of $44 million but public investment over the period stimulated economic activity throughout the Colony. The unexpended balances from the Two-year Programme are being incorporated into a Five-year Development Programme for the period 1955 to 1960.

The Programme is designed mainly to improve and extend basic developmental facilities, e.g. drainage and irrigation, roads, internal transport services and telecommunications, and to provide...
for an improvement and expansion of social services, in the fields of health, housing and education. It is financed partly from Colony funds, derived from loans and accumulated surplus revenue balances, and partly from Colonial Development and Welfare grants.

Arising from recommendations made by the International Bank Mission after their visit to the Colony in 1953, for the planning and execution of the Development Programme, an Economic Council has been set up and a Credit Corporation established to administer credits for the encouragement and development of agriculture, industry, forestry, fisheries, rural and urban housing. There is also a Development Programme Technical Co-ordination Committee consisting of Heads of Departments concerned with the Programme.

Regional Development Committees and Area Sub-Committees have been established in each of the twelve administrative districts to assist in general development activities, especially to promote aided self-help schemes and to advise the Credit Corporation on applications for loans.

Technical assistance in many fields of development work is being provided by the United States International Co-operation Administration whose personnel stationed in the Colony include a Director of Operations and administrative staff, and Specialists in Housing, Community Development, Geology, Agriculture, Land Settlement, and Drainage and Irrigation.

Other Development

Development is also being undertaken by the Colonial Development Corporation. The Corporation has acquired concessions for the large-scale development of timber in the area known as the Bartica Triangle, and has completed a new mill at Houston at a cost of over £600,000. The Corporation has shares in the British Guiana Consolidated Goldfields, Limited, which is engaged in the dredging and mining of alluvial gold, and in the associated Potaro Hydroelectric Company, Limited, which is building a small hydroelectric station at Tumatumari to provide necessary power. The Corporation has also furnished capital on short-term loan for the Rice Development Company.

Education

Nearly 80% of the population is literate. There are 301 primary schools (Government-owned and aided) with over 95,258 pupils. Secondary schools cater for about 7,640 students; these include two Government schools—Queen's College for boys and Bishops' High School for girls with a total enrolment of about 1,000 students. The Carnegie Trade School for women provides day and evening courses in various domestic crafts and the Technical Institute trains industrial apprentices and provides evening classes. The number of students studying in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland at 1st January, 1955, was 322; those studying in Canada at 30th June, 1955, numbered 28. There were 44 undergraduates enrolled at the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. In 1955 the total recurrent expenditure on Education was £1,086,188. In 1938 expenditure was £94,290.

Health

The principal diseases are filariasis, enteric fever, tuberculosis, helminthiasis and nutritional deficiency (especially vitamin B complex). Preventive measures provided by Government consist of a Sanitary Department with headquarters in Georgetown and branches in each district working under a Public Health Ordinance; Medical Officers of Health for each county; a School Medical Service with a School Medical Officer; a Maternity and Child Welfare League with a Lady Medical Officer of Health; a Mosquito Control Service under a Health Officer.

There were in 1955, five general Government Hospitals with 1,075 beds; two private general hospitals with a total of 240 beds; 20 cottage hospitals with 1,217 beds; one Tuberculosis Sanatorium with 201 beds; one Leprosy Hospital with 405 beds, and one Mental Hospital with 832 beds.

In 1938 Government expenditure on Medical Services was £126,025; in 1955, £960,511.

Communications

Atkinson Field is the only airport but there are a number of airstrips. Internal services are operated by British Guiana Airways. They are also the agents of the British West Indian Airways Limited who operate services between British Guiana and other parts of the Caribbean; other external services are provided by Pan American Airways and the K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines.

There are two Government-owned railway lines (single track), both parallel to the coast, 80 miles in length. Passengers carried in 1955 totalled 1,907,820 and freight totalled 68,940 tons.

There were in 1955 75 miles of roads with bituminous surface and 587 miles of burnt earth and other roads (including gravel trails).

The chief ports are Georgetown, New Amsterdam and Springlands, with a sub-port at Morawhanna. Port Georgetown handled nearly 2½ million tons of shipping in 1955. British Guiana is in direct communication with the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Canada, U.S.A., the West Indies, Surinam, and French Guiana. Services are provided for passengers and cargo principally by Booker Lines, Harrison Lines, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Alcoa, and Saguenay Terminals.

The three main rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable by ocean-going vessels of moderate draught for 60, 35, and 100 miles respectively. There are also numerous other rivers which are navigable in their tidal reaches by smaller vessels. There are very many long stretches of water in the upper rivers navigable by launches. Ferry services, coastal and river services are also operated by steamers.

Broadcasting

The commercial broadcasting station, Radio Demerara, operates on short and medium waves with a power of 500 watts, medium wave, and 2,000 watts, short wave. There were 27,449 licensed holders of radio receiving sets in 1955.

Principal Occupations

The greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture. Estimates of average employment for the following industries are: sugar-planting—20,548; sugar milling—5,544; bauxite—2,637; rice milling—900; saw-milling—1,382.
The Main Crops and Products are sugar, rum, molasses, rice, coconuts, bauxite, timber, gold and diamonds. In 1955 production was:

- Sugar: 250,111 tons
- Rum: 2,800,000 proof gals.
- Rice (milled): 89,100 tons
- Bauxite: 2,435,282 long tons
- Gold: 23,766 bullion ozs.
- Diamonds: 33,300 metric carats.

Timber production (principally greenheart, mora, and crabwood) in 1955 was nearly 7.1 million cubic feet.

The livestock population in 1954 was: goats 13,100; sheep 38,600; cattle 167,000; pigs 22,000; horses 3,700; mules 130; donkeys 6,700; poultry 564,800. This data does not include livestock under the direct control of the Sugar Estates.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

An independent Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of rice. This Board financed the purchase by rice farmers of tractors, combines, ploughs, etc. A hire service of mechanical equipment to farmers has been operated by Government mills and land settlement authorities.

Investigations into mechanized cultivation and the agronomic problems involved are carried out on the Mahaiqony-Abarry Rice Development Scheme.

At 31st December, 1955, there were 511 primary co-operative societies with 27,000 members and savings of £89,479.
