**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.**

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward Islands consist of the three islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically, Tobago from 1764 to 1783, and all three in 1838. The three first-named islands are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the three Colonies is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and their estimated population at 31st December, 1917, 177,653.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776, and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1838 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.
The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white and there are some Indian Coolies. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia, the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois. In Grenada the same condition obtains, but to a less extent.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. A Windward Islands Court of Appeal was set up in 1850 (13 & 14 Vict. c. 15), and abolished in 1920 by an Act (9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 47), which set up a Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica. There is also a common audit system instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. There is a temporary Government note issue, the denominations being 10s., 5s. and 2s. 6d., but the "Colonial Bank" and "Royal Bank of Canada," which have branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line, Grenada being the first and last port of call. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's Canadian line of steamers call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in telegraphic communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by cable to Havana and Bermuda. The rate per word for telegrams to the United Kingdom from Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent is 2s. 6d. The rate to Europe varies from 2s. 9d. to 3s. 4½d. per word. (Government messages pay half rates.) Government messages are always routed via Bermuda.

**GRENADA.**

**Situation, Area, etc.**

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; it is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 24th April, 1921) of 66,302.

**General Description.**

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former a sanatorium is established. All the roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. About 140 miles of main roads, all drivable, and a perfect network of byways (303 miles), all in good condition, provide for the important item of inland communication. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John, while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a District Commissioner. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping and, had on 31st December, 1920, 130 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,211 tons; its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call and coaling station for steamers. The town had a population of 4,629 by census of 24th April, 1921.
The other towns in the colony are Gouyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Pauvre), Sauteurs; Grenville (or La Baye); and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken, but the peasantry speak among themselves a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the Negro race, except the East Indian population, which was 181 in number according to the census of 1921.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. Yellow fever, the bugbear of the West Indies, is almost unknown, and if new arrivals do get a touch of "acclimatising fever," which is far from being the rule, it is mild and soon disappears. The average annual rainfall at St. George's for the 29 years, 1892-1920, is 76'68 inches and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer for the last five years are 93° and 71° respectively, the average mean temperature being 79° in the shade. The rainfall in other parts of the island is much greater; at the Grand Etang, in 1916, it was 140'93 inches.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. Unlike the other islands, however, it has long ceased to be a sugar-producing colony, and has therefore not suffered as they have from the depreciation in the value of cane sugar. There is at present hardly any sugar-cane cultivation. The chief produce of Grenada is, and has been for some time, cocoos, of which a total value of 466,658£ was shipped in 1920. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such, for instance, as rubber, limes, coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, etc. Nutmeg cultivation occupies a prominent position. So general is the cultivation of spices carried on here, that Grenada may be called "The Spice Island of the West." The value of spices exported in 1920 was 73,957£. In Carriacou cotton is the staple product, its cultivation having never been wholly abandoned there; the value exported in 1920 was with cotton seed, 48,678£. The cultivation of limes has now been successfully established in Carriacou, the exports of lime juice in 1920 amounting to 9,072£. Tropical fruits of almost every description and of the finest quality are fairly plentiful, and are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, tannias, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, etc. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullewood, locust, mahogany, white cedar, galba, etc. Rum is manufactured for local consumption, the total number of proof gallons in 1920 being 49,823.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit and poultry.

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,467.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889, and the number of depositors on 31st December, 1920, was 1,509, the amount at credit of depositors being 18,636£.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French Company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; and in 1762 it was surrendered to the British under Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estatign; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1795-6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated by the French Republic. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred by the rebels, and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established in regard to the African slaves, and this was followed in 1838 by their unconditional emancipation.

Constitution.

There was from 1766 a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 21 elected members.

Under an Act of 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100£ a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most
desirable for the welfare of the Colony.” The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and Crown Colony Government was established in December, 1877. The Legislative Council now consists of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The members hold their seats for 3 years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards, and by unofficial Road Wardens, who, with Road Surveyors attached to the Public Works Department, attend to the upkeep of the main roads.

Education.

There are 59 elementary schools, 11 Government and 48 aided. These schools are of three classes, Infant, Lower Division and Combined, and the law also provides for a fourth class, Industrial schools. Head teachers of combined schools are paid from £60. to £100. per annum, according to their certificates of proficiency, and to the class of school. Bonuses are given them for long service or extra duties. Grants are also given by Government in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. The administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1920 the average attendance was 5,847 children, the number on the rolls being 9,437. There is a secondary school for boys, and two for girls, which receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue. There is also one Technical School recently established.

ST. LUCIA.

Situation and Area.
The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long.; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 24 miles in length, and 12 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is 150 miles, and its area 233:29 sq. miles, rather less than Middlesex. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 1,422 houses, and a population of 5,899 as per census of 24th April, 1921. Next in importance is the town of Soufrière, containing a population of 2,480 souls.

History.
At the period of its discovery St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orléans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Islet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.
In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms on the 4th of April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population by census of 1921 amounts to 51,505. Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but English is gradually becoming more generally used. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, except 2,189 of East Indian origin. The reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is undeserved, the death rate for 1920 being 21.7 per 1,000, and for the year 1918-19 28.3 per 1,000. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation.

The danger from venomous reptiles is also much exaggerated. Owing to the introduction and spread of the mongoose, snakes are now but rarely met with. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are almost unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday, in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera.

Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour, Dredging operations have been carried out in the harbour, rendering it more commodious. A substantial concrete wharf, 650 feet in length, with a depth alongside of 27 feet at low water, has been completed, and the western wharf, having a length of 552 feet, has been refaced in wood, and dredged to an average depth alongside of 18 feet to 24 feet. The facilities offered by the port as a port of call and coaling station are widely recognised. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1920, 13 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,159 tons.

A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and has now 1,322 depositors, with 19,476£. to their credit on 31st December, 1920. Branch savings banks were opened at Soufrière and Vieux Fort in March, 1898, at Dennery and Gros Islet in November, 1905, and at Anse-la-Raye in December, 1906.

Constitution and Law.

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Sénéchaussée," and a higher Court, called the "Conseil Supérieur," or Court of Appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council. The Legislature consists of the Administrator and a Council composed as the King may direct. Law is administered by a Chief Justice, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the West Indian Court of Appeal, and two magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve as in England.

A code of civil law, the authors of which were Sir G. W. Des Vœux, G.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code has been framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances. The Statute Law of the Colony was consolidated to 1916 by Mr. F. H. Coller, Chief Justice, who also edited the Commercial Code, 1916.

The revising and editing of the Criminal Law and Procedure of the Colony by Mr. J. E. M. Salmon was completed during 1920 and proclaimed as the Criminal Code, 1920. It came into force on the 1st January, 1921.

Education.

On the 30th June, 1891, the trustees of the Lady Mico charity closed the eleven schools which they had till then maintained, and withdrew their connection with the Colony. Three of these schools became Government schools, and the others assisted schools under the new Education Ordinance. In 1898 all the Government schools were handed over to the Roman Catholic body, and became assisted schools. There were, on the 31st December, 1920, 50 assisted schools. The number of children on the rolls was 6,404, and the amount spent by the Colony on primary education was £4,640. The Government grants £400 a year to a Roman Catholic second-grade school, which has over 100 pupils on the roll; the Sisters of St. Joseph conduct a similar school for girls. The number of pupils on the roll is 138, and a Government grant of £175 is made to the school annually.

Industry.

Sugar, cocoa, logwood, cocoanuts, limes, Bay oil, and spices are produced. There are four sugar "Usines" with the best machinery, and
the export of cocoa is increasing. Limes are being extensively planted, and a Government Factory has been erected in Castries, with the object of encouraging the establishment of the industry among small proprietors, at which limes and lime-juice are purchased at market rates. Rubber and cotton grow well, and samples of the former prepared at the Botanic Station, from trees growing there, have received favourable reports.

A considerable amount of land is in the possession of the Crown, and may be purchased in lots up to and including 50 acres, at £1 per acre, and for every acre beyond 50 at 10/- per acre, payable by four equal annual instalments. In the event of a certain area being put into permanent cultivation before the due date of the last instalment, that instalment may be remitted. Under the Crown Lands Regulations, the period over which (in certain cases) the payment of the purchase money may be spread is ten years. The soil will grow any kind of tropical fruit trees or economic plants.

Surveys are made at the cost of the purchaser.

ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 96,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from Kingstown.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contained at the census of 1921, a population of 3,836 souls. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1921, 19 vessels of a net tonnage of 397 tons.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Barrouallie on the west.

The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufrière," or volcano, situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rising to about 4,098 feet above the level of the sea. After a violent eruption in 1812, it remained dormant for a period of ninety years, and then broke into violent eruption again on May 7th, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont Pelée in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carlo Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates. The next highest point after the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. St. Lucia and Barbados also suffered from this storm, but in lesser degree. There has, however, been no hurricane since that year.

Climate.

In the dry season, December to June, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy, and fever is almost unknown. The nights are cool all the year round. The rainfall during 1920 was 85.51 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during the same year was 81°0°F., the lowest 77.3°F., the mean monthly temperature being 79°0°F. in the shade. The prevailing wind is N.E.
Industry and Communications.

Sugar, rum, cocoa, and excellent arrowroot are produced. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention, and Sea Island cotton, the best in the Empire, is now extensively planted, for the ginning of which a Government Ginnery has been erected. Most of the sugar and all the arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivable land is owned by a few individuals; portions of Crown lands have been alienated to peasant proprietors, and several estates have been purchased by the Government with the aid of an Imperial grant and allotted to the same class of settlers. The forests produce excellent woods. There are 59 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne. There are also some 230 miles of byeway connecting with the highway.

The port of Kingstown is visited fortnightly by the Royal Mail S.P. Co.'s Canadian Line, and occasionally by the steamers of the "Direct" Line (Messrs. Scrutton, Sons & Co.).

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 7 branch exchanges, with 173 connections and some 169 miles of line.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £63,625.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1795 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Ruanan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of East Indian Coolie labourers in 1861. Most of them returned to India, but some made their home in the Colony.

Constitution.

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly. The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex officio, three nominated by the Crown and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. The Legislative Council now consists of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.
There were, on 31st December, 1920, 27 schools, with 3,669 children on the rolls. The average attendance during 1920 was 1,912. There is also a government secondary school for boys, and a high school for girls.

The Government expenditure on education in 1920 was £2,069.

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 921 depositors, with 16,530£ deposited, at 31st December, 1920. Branches of the bank have been opened at Georgetown, Barrouallie, and Union Island.

ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is the largest coraline island on the African coast, being 48 miles long by 15 broad, and having an area of 640 square miles. To the north east at a distance of some thirty miles lies the island of Pemba, in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 40 miles long by 10 broad, and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The annual rainfall amounts approximately in Zanzibar to 58 inches and in Pemba to 83 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined; the heavy rains occur in April previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in
November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The thermometer ranges from 77° to 90° with a minimum of 80°. The climatic conditions though trying in the hot season which lasts from November to March are not necessarily unfavourable to Europeans provided that periods of residence are limited to terms of from twenty to thirty months.

**People.**

The Arabs were the conquerors and are the principal landowners of the islands. The conditions of life in a malarious and tropical country have deprived them of much of the vigorous temperament which distinguished their ancestors and the stoppage of the supply of slaves has left many of them almost without any resources. Nevertheless, though shaken by the ordeal through which they have passed, they still possess most of the land, and carry on the clove growing industry for which the two islands are famous. They understand the natives, and the natives understand them and accept their control more readily than that of any other race, except Europeans.

The bulk of the Zanzibar population consists of representatives of all the tribes of East Africa, intermingled with an Asiatic element. The name given to this mixed population is Swahili, a term formerly used to note the coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "sahil" in Arabic meaning coast.

The descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern portion of the island and especially on the east coast. They are the principal cattle breeders of the island. An Mhadimu is literally a servant, a term bestowed by the northern tribes when they conquered the country.

The natives of Pemba are known as Wapemba; they do not live in such seclusion as the Wahadimu on the larger island, but intermingle more freely with the Arabs and Swahili.

Khojas, Bohoras, Hindoos, Parsees, Goanese possess most of the trade of Zanzibar either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders or skilled mechanics. Goanese keep the European stores and provide both cooks and dhobis. They and the Parsees are also employed largely as clerks.

There is a considerable contingent of natives of Tanganyika Territory and of the Comoro islands who have settled in Zanzibar and with the northeast monsoon arrive numbers of Somalis, Shihiri Arabs and Baluchis in dhows laden with the products of their countries. These people usually return with the south-west monsoon, but a few remain and settle permanently.

**History.**

The early history of Zanzibar is chiefly a record of petty feuds and complicated quarrels. The so-called "Zenj Empire" was already declining when the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral towards the close of fifteenth century. It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by making the island his permanent residence and by encouraging the cultivation of cloves. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "all Africa as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000L. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000L.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the Imperial Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

**Industries and Trade.**

The clove industry is by far the most important in the Protectorate, the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba yielding the bulk of the world's supply. The clove was first introduced into Zanzibar from Réunion in 1818, and Sir Richard Burton remarks that as early as 1835 it had "almost supplanted the vulgar valuable coconut and the homely rice necessary for local consumption." He advised the Arabs of Zanzibar to follow the example of Mauritius and to give up cloves in favour of sugar. Colonel Rigby wrote in 1860:—"Were the prosperity of the Zanzibar Dominions dependent upon these degenerated Arabs it might well be despaired of," and complained of their lack of initiative in refusing to cultivate anything else. In spite of advice, however, and notwithstanding disasters—the hurricane of 1872, which devastated the main island, cutting off every clove and coconut tree, and the smallpox epidemic of 1898, which decimated the population—the Arabs clung to their cloves, and, by thus concentrating on one
product, "surpassing all plants in value," to quote Lord Acton, have given Zanzibar a position on the world's market which she would probably never have attained had her energies been dissipated over a large variety. It is estimated that there are in both Islands about 60,000 acres under cloves and about 5½ million trees in bearing. The output varies considerably, the trees yielding heavy crops every three to five years; the average output of recent years has been about 14 million lbs. The large plantations are chiefly owned by Arabs, but many natives possess small holdings.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 45,000 acres under cultivation and 2½ million trees in both Islands. The export of copra, which is steadily increasing, amounted in 1915 to 10,286 tons. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Cochin and Ceylon.

The principal export besides cloves and copra is chillies; re-exports, gum copal, hides and skins, ivory and rubber.

The chief imports are piece-goods, rice, various grains and petroleum.

Currency and Banking.

The silver rupee of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, is the standard coin of Zanzibar. All other silver coins of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. These coins are ½, ¼, and ⅛ of a rupee. British India 1 rupee notes are also legal tender to any amount. Seyyidish copper pie are legal tender at the rate of 64 pie to 1 rupee for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. There is a Government note issue of the denominations Rupees 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500.

The National Bank of India, Ltd., and the Standard Bank of South Africa have branches in Zanzibar.

Shipping and Communications.

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Beaulieu coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend to indicate that the Island will continue, by reason of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic.

The British India Steam Navigation Company and the Union Castle Steamship Company maintain monthly services between London—Zanzibar—Durban and Southampton—Zanzibar—Durban respectively, the Clan-Ellerman-Harrison Line between Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), and the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes between Marseilles—Zanzibar—Madagascar. The British India Steam Navigation Company also maintain a service twice a month between Bombay—Zanzibar—Durban, and there are local services between Zanzibar—Mombasa—Aden and the Benadir Coast. The Government possesses two steamers which maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba.

The steamers of the Societa Maritima Italiana call three times weekly between Genoa and Durban and back to Genoa.

The steamers of the Holland Africa Line call about once in 21 days between Amsterdam and back to Amsterdam via Durban.

Portuguese Government steamers call at irregular intervals from Lisbon via the West Coast, and back to Lisbon via the Suez Canal.

There is cable communication with Europe either via Aden or via Durban.

There are 75 miles of roads throughout the Island of Zanzibar suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations in Zanzibar and Pemba and a telephone system in the town of Zanzibar which is connected with the District and Agricultural Stations in the country. A light railway runs north from the town to Bububu, 7 miles distant.

There are 7 post offices in the two Islands.

Constitution and Government.

The Government is administered by a High Commissioner and a British Resident, who are appointed by commissions under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercise their functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1914.

Legislation consists of certain British and Indian Statutes, and also of Decrees of His Highness the Sultan, which latter are binding on all persons when countersigned by the British Resident under the Order in Council.

There is a Council for the Protectorate which exercises functions of an advisory and consultative nature and consists of His Highness the Sultan as President, the British Resident as Vice-President, and three official and four unofficial members.

Justice is administered in His Britannic Majesty's Court for Zanzibar and in the Court for Zanzibar and Pemba, the former exercising jurisdiction over British and foreign subjects and in all cases in which one of the parties is a British or foreign subject, and the latter over subjects of His Highness the Sultan. Appeals from His Britannic Majesty's Court for Zanzibar lie to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa.

APPENDIX TO PART II.

This Appendix gives some account of Iraq (Mesopotamia), North Borneo, Palestine, Sarawak and certain miscellaneous British Possessions and Protectorates which are not included in the main portion of the Historical and Statistical Account above.

IRAQ (MESOPOTAMIA).

Iraq, in the sense in which the name is used now, is that part of the former Ottoman Empire which stretches from Fao on the Persian Gulf to a point north of Mosul and just south of Jazirah-Bin-Umar, on the Tigris. It comprises the vilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul, with the exception of Amadiyah which, by the Treaty of Sèvres, is left to Turkey.

The area of Iraq is about 143,000 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the new Turkish frontier, which approximates to latitude 37° N. and follows the northern boundary of the vilayet of Mosul. On the east, it is bounded by Persia. The frontier, the delimitation of which was completed by a Turko-Persian Commission in 1914, runs in the north through, and in the southern portion skirts, the Kurdish mountains which form the western edge of the Persian plateau, and descends 10 miles above Mohammerah to the Shatt-al-Arab, the river formed by the union of the Euphrates and the Tigris. On the south, Iraq is bounded by the Persian Gulf and Kuwait; and on the south-west and west by the deserts of northern Arabia and Syria. On the north-west, the boundary between Iraq and Syria was settled by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920. It runs from the Tigris at Feishkhabur to Albu Kemal on the Euphrates, and thence across the desert to Imtar, south of Jebel Druz. Apart from the hill country in the north-east, Iraq mainly consists of great plains traversed by the Euphrates and the Tigris. The country between these rivers is divided into two parts. The southern portion, stretching from Baghdad to Basrah is a great alluvial plain about 35,000 square miles in area with a fertile soil wherever the land can be irrigated without being drowned. A considerable extent of it is, however, covered by marshes formed by the uncontrolled action of the rivers and canals. The northern portion known as Jazirah or "the Island," is more undulating, and is in places broken by ranges of hills. It is fertile under irrigation in the north, but further south the plains become more arid until it passes into a hard desert tract.

The climate of Iraq is of the continental sub-tropical type, with very high temperatures in summer in the plains. In July and August the mean daily maximum temperature is 104° F. at Basrah, and 110° F. at Baghdad, while in December and January the mean daily minimum temperature is 47° F. at Basra and 40° F. at Baghdad. The rainy season is from November to March. There is a rainless summer of six months lasting from about April to September. The Mosul area has a rainfall of about 13 inches a year and relies on the rain to grow its crops. The rest of the country, however, has an annual rainfall of only about seven inches, and the crops are grown, with very little help from the rain, on irrigated land.

The chief towns are Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, Kerbeila, and Nejer. The two last, situated on the edge of the Arabian desert, are pilgrim centres which attract Shi'ahs from all parts of the Mohammedan world, but especially from Persia and India.

Population.

According to a census taken in 1920 the population numbers 2,849,282, made up as follows:

|                | Sunni   | Shi'ah | Jewish | Christian | Other Religions | Total  |
|----------------|---------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Basrah Vilayet | 42,558  | 721,414| 10,088 | 2,551     | 8,989           | 785,600|
| Baghdad Vilayet| 524,414 | 750,421| 62,665 | 20,771    | 2,133           | 1,360,304|
| *Mosul Vilayet | 579,713 | 22,180 | 14,835 | 55,470    | 31,180          | 703,378|
| Total          | 1,146,685| 1,494,015| 87,488 | 78,792    | 42,302          | 2,849,282|

* The figures for Mosul include the population of the Kurdish area of Sulaimaniyah, viz., 155,000, of whom all but 1,100 are Sunnis.

Natural Products.

The chief articles of export from Iraq before the war were dates, wool and barley. Dates and wool have continued to be exported, but the export of barley has fallen almost to nothing, mainly because of the purchases made by the British military authorities in Iraq. Round Mosul the prevailing crop is wheat, but all the wheat grown is consumed in the country. Rice, in most cases "red" rice of inferior quality, is grown on the swampy lands on the Middle Euphrates, in the Amarrah area on the Tigris, and to a small extent, on the Diyalah canals, near Baghdad. Rice of better quality but in very small quantities is grown in the Kurdish hills.

In the Kurdish regions round Sulaimaniyah and Rowanduz and to the north of Mosul tobacco is an important crop. The crop is hardly sufficient for local requirements. None is exported.

In the Baghdad Vilayet cotton can be grown. Experiments carried out since the occupation of Baghdad in 1917 tend to show that Iraq cotton compares favourably with cotton grown in other parts of the world.
Wool is exported in considerable quantities. The principal sheep-rearing districts are the Mosul area and the Kurdish hills.

There are traces of petroleum in many places round Mosul and Kirkuk and near the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanasirin.

Minor products are millet, licorice root, gall-nuts, gum and dye-roots.

**Railways.**

The railways open to traffic are—

*Metre Gauge.*

1. From Basrah to Baghdad (about 300 miles).
2. From Baghdad to Quraith on the Persian frontier (130 miles) with a branch line to Kifri (50 miles).
3. From Baghdad to Shargat (about 200 miles).

With the exception of about 75 miles of the Baghdad-Shargat line, which was built by the Baghdad Railway Company before the war, the whole of this railway system has been made by the British authorities during and since the war.

There is a gap of 70 miles between the Mesopotamian railroad at Shargat and Mosul; and the Baghdad Railway comes down to Nisibin, about 110 miles from Mosul. Thus railway communication between Constantinople and Basrah, via Aleppo, Mosul and Baghdad is complete except for a gap of less than 200 miles.

**Government.**

The war left Iraq in British occupation; and by the Treaty of Sèvres (10th August, 1920), Turkey renounced all sovereignty over the country. On March 2nd, 1921, the supervision of the affairs of Iraq was transferred to the Colonial Office.

In Turkish times each of the three Vilayets was governed by a Vali, who received orders directly from Constantinople. The official hierarchy, in descending order of importance, was:

- **Vali**, in charge of Vilayet.
- **Mutasarrif**, Liwa.
- **Qaimmaqam**, Qadha.
- **Mu'dir**, Nahiyah.

As Iraq came under British control, as a result of the military operations of 1914-1918, British Political Officers took over the administration of liwas and qadhas, working under the orders of the Chief Political Officer (later the Civil Commissioner). This system was modified when Sir Percy Cox was appointed High Commissioner. When he took up his post in the autumn of 1920, he organised a provisional native Government composed of a Council of Arab Ministers which was presided over by the Naqib of Baghdad. On August 23rd, 1921, the Sharif Faisal, third son of the King of the Hejaz was proclaimed King of Iraq, by virtue of a referendum to the people, which resulted in his election by 96%.

The government of the country is thus vested in an Iraq Government, the King being advised by the British High Commissioner, while each Ministry has a British Adviser attached to it. Every Liwa is administered by a native Mutasarrif, who is assisted by a British Inspector.

**NORTH BORNEO.**

**Situation and Area.**

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lehad Datu, and Tawao, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at Jesselton. Other stations are at Labuk, Kotabehud, Tuaran, Tambunan, Kaningau, Tenom, Beaufort, Pensangan, Lamag, Papar, Putatan, Ranau, Timbang Batu, Sempona, Mempakul, Sipitong and Rundum.

**General Description.**

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be
well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, cocoanuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The mineral resources of the country are now being fully investigated. Gold has been found in three of the rivers on the east coast; coal, manganese, and other minerals have also been met with, and are being worked.

The country is mountainous. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who according to the Census taken in 1911 number about 216,000, are mainly Bruneis, Ibanuns, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the interior they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt, clearing fresh jungle every year; the Muruts, another interior tribe, are very numerous and peaceable, occasionally varying more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting raids on a petty scale. There are Chinese settlements on the coast; they cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. There are 400 Europeans and 30,000 Chinese in the territory. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of 12,000. There are two missions, one the Church of England, with stations at Kudat and Jesselton and Beaufort, and one Roman Catholic, with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission also has schools at Kudat, Beaufort and Papar, and at Sandakan and Tenom.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1863 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 120 inches, according to situation.

Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce, and much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco and rubber, for which the soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited. The value of tobacco exported in 1912 was $2,264,378; in 1913, $2,919,970; in 1914, $1,913,365; in 1915, $2,342,758; in 1916, $1,519,155; in 1917, $172,603; in 1918, $42,140; and in 1920, $191,168; of estate rubber, 1912, $879,207; 1913, $1,768,183; 1914, $1,615,461; 1915, $2,348,754; 1916, $4,327,195; 1917, $634,564; 1918, $627,236; and in 1920, $689,307; and of timber, 1912, $727,083; 1913, $869,463; 1914, $863,666; 1915, $831,466; 1916, $774,944; 1917, $43,796; 1918, $41,702; and in 1920, £155,048. Coconut plantations are rapidly increasing in number, and the export of coconuts and of copra is becoming of importance. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper and tea. There is a large and increasing export of plantation rubber. The enormous virgin forests of North Borneo have enabled a lucrative timber trade to be carried on with China and Manila, and inquiries for railway sleepers are now coming from various parts of the world. Sleepers have already been supplied to Manila, and it is certain that this trade can be largely developed. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay, where two large saw mills have been working for some years. A slipway carrying vessels up to 150 feet in length or a dead weight of 600 tons has been constructed. The Cutch factory is doing a considerable business, and another factory has been established in Marudu Bay. An electric light and Power Company has been established at Sandakan.

An electric light and cold storage company has been established at Jesselton, which port is rapidly growing in size and importance. Large development works have been undertaken by the Government at Jesselton, and are now completed. The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, cutch, etc., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, stamps, and royalties, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.
Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports. It is also rapidly becoming of importance as a coaling station for ocean liners.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. A syndicate has recently been formed for the working of the oil belts which have been discovered on the West Coast.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent, and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars. A State Bank of North Borneo has been established with head office at Sandakan, and a branch office at Jesselton. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Chinese Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Taiwan. A State Bank is in process of formation.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are 10 provinces divided into five Residencies (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, Myburgh, and Clarke).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British Colonies, and an Imam's court, for the administration of Mohammedan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 850 armed police under European officers.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every 10 days between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government have constructed a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Beaufort, 20 miles, and from Beaufort to Jesselton, 57 miles, and a line of 33 miles from Beaufort to Tenom, which will open up the interior. In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 120 miles. The principal coastal terminus is Jesselton, at which port there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. Over 600 miles of telegraph line are open, and wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau. Several riding roads already exist, and over 400 miles of bridle path have been constructed. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about twenty-six days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 4 cents per oz.; foreign countries, 10 cents per ½ oz.

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau-Sebatik. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Lamag and Labad Datu from Sandakan, and Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan and Kudat.

PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the French sphere of Syria and the Lebanon, on the west by the Mediterranean, and on the south by Egyptian and Hedjaz territory, the boundary running from just west of Rafa on the Mediterranean to just east of Taba at the head of the Gulf of Akaba, and then north-east. On the east, the boundary is undefined.

The boundary on the north was settled by the Anglo-French Convention of 23rd December, 1920, but has not yet been entirely delimited. From the Mediterranean Sea, just south of Ras-el-Nakura, and about half way between Tyre and Acre, it runs eastwards and northwards to Metullah (British), and across the Upper Jordan Valley to Banias (French). It then runs south-eastwards to Shek, and thence down the rivers Jeraba and Massadye to the north-eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias and across the Lake to Semakh at its southern extremity. From Semakh, the boundary runs up the Yarmuk Valley, leaving the existing railway to Nasib in the French sphere.

Palestine comprises four zones of country. On the west, along the shores of the Mediterranean, which are deficient here in good natural harbours, is a low plain, which varies from 15 to 20 miles in width at Gaza to about two miles at Acre, but which, at one place, the plain of Esdraelon, stretches for a considerable distance into the interior, and separates the high lands of Galilee from those of Samaria and Judea. From the coastal plain, the country rises into a plateau, intersected by deep valleys, which drops steeply to the east to the third zone, which is formed by the great depression down which the River Jordan runs to the Dead Sea, and which is prolonged for another 100 miles to the Red Sea as the Wadi Araba. This depression reaches a depth below sea level of 2,600 feet in the deepest portion of the Dead Sea, the surface of which is about 1,300 feet below sea level, and which is 46 miles long with an average breadth of 8½ miles. East of the Jordan valley the country rises again, and merges into the Syrian desert.
The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude; the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated hilly zone is drier and more temperate; the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight; while, further east still, the neighbourhood of the desert makes its effect marked on both the temperature and the rainfall. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are the wettest months, and the main rainfall occurs between November and April.

Water for domestic use is obtained in towns mostly from rock-cut cisterns in which rain water is collected, and in rural districts also from wells. Jerusalem has a piped water supply, pumped from a spring about 10 miles south of the town, the installation having been made by the Military Authorities soon after its occupation.

Considerable progress has been made towards the eradication of Malaria, formerly so prevalent, by Government distribution of quinine in villages, oiling of wells and cisterns, and drainage of swamps.

Government.

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet of Beirut, part in the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem, and part, that which is now termed Trans-Jordania, in the Vilayet of Damascus.

After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British Forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July 1st, 1920, when Sir Herbert Louis Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

Under the Treaty of Sevres, signed on 10th August, 1920, Turkey renounced her sovereignty over the country, and under the draft Mandate submitted in December, 1920, to the Council of the League of Nations (Cmd. 1176), the Mandate for Palestine was to be entrusted to Great Britain, as the Supreme Council of the Allied Powers had already agreed, on 25th April, 1920, at San Remo.

The draft Mandate contemplates the establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people, according to the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, which has been incorporated in the Peace Treaty with Turkey. The Balfour Declaration was in these terms:—

"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

The High Commissioner appointed an Advisory Council, composed of the heads of the principal Government Departments, and 10 "unofficial" members (four Moslems, three Christians, and three Jews), representing the various communities. The Jewish population of Palestine have perfected their internal organisation by convening an elected Assembly, which elected a National Committee, to represent the Jewish population of Palestine in its dealings with the Administration. English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

The British Government and Palestine Administration recognise the World Zionist Organisation, which in Palestine is represented by the Palestine Zionist Executive, as the Agency of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home.

Proposed New Constitution.

In February, 1922, details were published of a provisional draft of a new constitution to replace the existing arrangements. The proposals, which have not yet been finally settled, provide for the appointment of a High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief and an Executive Council.

A Legislative Council will replace the Advisory Council and will have authority to pass such Ordinances as may be necessary for the peace, order and good government of Palestine, provided (1) that no Ordinance shall restrict complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship, save in so far as is required for the maintenance of public order and morals, or shall tend to discriminate in any way between the inhabitants of Palestine on the ground of race, religion or language; (2) that no Ordinance shall take effect until either the High Commissioner or His Majesty has assented thereto, and; (3) that the High Commissioner may reserve any Ordinance for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure, and shall so reserve any Ordinance which concerns matters dealt with specifically by the provisions of the Mandate, and that His Majesty may disallow any Ordinance to which the High Commissioner may have assented within one year of the date of the High Commissioner's assent.

The Legislative Council will consist, in addition to the High Commissioner, of 25 members, of whom 10 will be official members and 15 unofficial members. Twelve of the unofficial members will be elected and three nominated; one to be nominated by the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Palestine, and the other two, being persons not holding public office in Palestine, to be nominated by the High Commissioner with a view to the representation of any community or interest which after the elections are held shall be found to have insufficient representation on the Council, this power to be exercised in such a way that one of the nominated members shall be a Moslem, one a Christian, and one a Jew.

The elected members of the Legislative Council will be chosen by primary and secondary elections. Every male Palestinian citizen over 25 years of age will be entitled to vote at the primary election, unless he has lost his civil rights or claims to be a foreign subject, or under foreign protection, or is otherwise disqualified. The number of secondary electors to be elected in each electoral area will be determined on the basis that every 200 primary electors will elect one secondary elector. If any village or quarter has between 150 and 200 primary electors, it will be entitled to vote for one secondary elector; if it has between 350 and 400 primary electors it will be entitled to vote for two secondary electors, and so on.

Any person may be elected as a secondary elector provided he is on the register of primary electors for the district.

The secondary electors will be formed into twelve electoral colleges according to the religious community to which they belong; the members of colleges to be allotted to each religious community will be proportionate to the number of secondary electors belonging to the several communities; and each electoral college will elect one member of the Council.

Special provision is made for the government of territories comprised in Palestine to the east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea.
Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into four districts, administered by Governors: Jerusalem, Galilee, Samaria and the Southern District.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is about 9,000 square miles in extent, and includes only that part of Historic Palestine which lies to the west of the Jordan. The population of this territory on July 1st, 1921, was approximately 770,000, of which number one-third is located in 22 small towns and large villages.

There are 600,000 Moslems, 84,500 Christians, 80,000 Jews, some 5,700 Druzes, and 170 Samaritans.

Palestine, east of the Jordan, known as Trans-Jordania, is controlled by a separate administration under supervision of the High Commissioner for Palestine.

The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population is estimated at 64,000. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large bands of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Mosque of Omar, which contains a relic of Mahomet and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The population figures for the other principal towns are: Jaffa, 45,100; Gaza, 15,000; Haifa, 39,000; Nazareth, 9,000; Nablus, 20,000; Tulkarm, 3,000; Safed, 14,000; Tiberias, 6,000; Jenin, 4,000; Hebron, 16,000; Ramleh, 10,000.

The Jewish Colonies are grouped in four districts as follows: in Jerusalem District, 21; in Samaria, 10; in Lower Galilee, 20; in Upper Galilee, 10.

The total population of these settlements is about 17,000. Thirteen of them belong to the Jewish National Fund, which was established by the Zionist Organization for the purpose of acquiring lands to remain the national property of the Jewish people. The Palestine Land Development Company, also organised by the Zionist Organization, owns the lands of Tel-Adas, Kalandiah, and lands on the Carmel, at Jaffa, Jerusalem, etc. The other colonies were founded mostly by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and by the Jewish Colonization Association, which administers all the properties of Baron Rothschild. The total area of the Jewish Settlements is 652,653 dunams (4½ dunams equals 1 acre).

The local affairs of the Jewish Colonies are controlled by Vaads or Councils elected by the male and female residents who own registered holdings or pay taxes.

Instruction.

The approximate number of children under 14 in Palestine is as follows:—Moslem, 110,000; Christian, 12,500; Jews, 12,000. The schools maintained by the Government number 246, and contain 15,500 children. The great majority of the scholars are Moslems. The extension of village education undertaken by the Government is being carried out, and 75 new schools have been opened since January, 1921. The Training Colleges for Teachers have been extended and the number of men students increased to 75 and of women to 50. Technical education is being carried out systematically in the villages and in some of the towns. A Law School has been opened in Jerusalem, and a School of Pharmacy is in progress of organization.

The Christian and Jewish Communities provide to a very large extent for the education of their own children.

The Zionist Organization, through the Department of Education attached to the Palestine Zionist Executive, controls 135 educational institutions in Palestine, with a staff of 523 teachers, and attended by 12,330 pupils. These institutions include Gymnasia at Jerusalem and Jaffa, Teachers' Training Colleges (General, Orthodox, Women's and Kindergarten), Schools of Music in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, an Agricultural School, an Arts and Crafts Institute (Bezalel), Commercial Evening Classes, and a Technical College.

Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are either civil or religious courts. The former have jurisdiction over local subjects in all matters save those of personal status and charitable endowments, and over foreign subjects in all matters, subject to the provisions mentioned below.

Civil Courts.

There is a Magistrate Court in every sub-district and, in the larger towns, such as Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Haifa, two such courts. The Magistrate is in every case a Palestinian and has jurisdiction in first instance in minor criminal cases of which the punishment is not more than one year's imprisonment, and in civil cases where the subject matter does not exceed £E. 100. He has also jurisdiction in actions for the recovery of the possession of land.

There are four District Courts, each composed of a British President and two Palestinian members. They serve respectively the district of Jerusalem, the sub-districts of Jaffa and Gaza, and the districts of Samaria and Galilee, and go on circuit within the area of their jurisdiction. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance in all crimes and civil cases not within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate, and also hears appeals from the decisions of Magistrates both in civil and in criminal cases, except in cases for the recovery of the possession of land.

The Court of Appeal is composed of a British Chief Justice, a British Vice-President and four Palestinian members. A division of this court normally consists of the Chief Justice or the Vice-President and two Palestinian members. It has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided in first instance by the District Courts, and in actions for the recovery of the possession of land decided by Magistrates. It also hears appeals from the Land Courts.

A bench of honorary magistrates has been established in Jerusalem, Jaffa and Haifa, who try contraventions for which the maximum penalty does not exceed £E. 5 fine and 15 days' imprisonment.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba District, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs. A British Judge visits Beersheba every month to hear appeals from the local courts and to try more serious criminal cases.
Two Land Courts have been established in the sub-district of Jaffa and the district Samaria respectively, and a third will shortly be established in Jerusalem. These courts, which are composed of a British President and a Palestinian Judge, hear all cases in which the ownership of land is in issue.

Religious Courts.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Kadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moslem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish Religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Jews, and jurisdiction by consent in other matters. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish Religious Courts lies to the Rabbinical Council.

Other religious communities (such as the Latin and Orthodox) retain the courts and jurisdiction which they enjoyed in the Turkish régime.

Special Rules of Court exist with regard to the trial of foreigners. The general effect of these rules is that where a foreign subject is charged with an offence more serious than a contravention he may claim to be tried by a British Magistrate or by a Court containing a majority of British Judges.

The official languages of the Courts are English, Arabic and Hebrew.

Production and Industry.

Although economic conditions are still primitive, modern methods are making headway and hold out hopes of development and progress. The country is generally fertile, and cereals, wine, olives and various fruits are produced, while sheep and goats thrive both in the lowlands and in the mountains.

For the most part the crops are raised without irrigation, except where springs exist, and on the banks of the Auja, in the district of Jaffa. There are generally two cereal crops each year, harvested in May and September.

For the area under British Administration, exclusive of Trans-Jordania, the following are the figures of cereal production, and of the taxable animal census, during 1920–21.

| Crop                  | Quantity |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Wheat                 | 75,133   |
| Barley                | 51,869   |
| Millet (Durrah)       | 30,352   |
| Grapes (Wine and Dessert) | 5,490    |
| Olive Oil             | 6,706    |
| Water Melons and Melons | 16,351   |
| Lentils               | 3,211    |

| Animal                | Quantity |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Sheep                | 262,400  |
| Goats                | 271,750  |
| Camels               | 9,000    |
| Buffaloes            | 620      |

Limestone is found all over the country; sandstone abounds on the coast; gypsum of good quality is found at Mount Gipsa near Melhamia (Galilee). Rock salt abounds in the Jordan Valley and on the shores of the Dead Sea, where sulphur is also obtainable. Mineral oil is said to be found, but pending the ratification of the Mandate no work on concessions is permitted. The Dead Sea contains cooking salt, carnallite, and bromide. There are medicinal hot springs in the Jordan Valley, the most important being at Tiberias.

The only industries of export importance are those of wine-making in the Jewish Colonies, especially Zichron-Jacob, Rishon-le-Zion, and Petach-Tikvah; soap-boiling in Nablus and Haifa olive oil in Nablus, Akka, and the district round Jaffa.

Oranges, grown chiefly in the Jaffa District, are exported to Egypt and Europe, the total quantity exported during the year ended 31st March, 1921, being 830,959 cases valued at £E. 200,475.

A Woods and Forests Ordinance has been promulgated and also various Forestry Regulations supplementary to the Ordinance, for the protection, management and control of existing forests. The country had been terribly deforested during the Ottoman régime.

Nine nurseries have been established for the raising of forest trees and fruit stock. Planting commenced last year at each centre where nurseries exist is being considerably extended. Special attention is being given to the reclamation of sand dunes and the planting of road sides.

Shipping and Communications.

The chief Ports of Palestine are Jaffa and Haifa. There is a small haven at Acre, and coasting vessels touch at Gaza and Caesarea.

In the year ending 31st March, 1921, 603 steamers of 779,521 tons, 151 men-of-war of 222,521 tons, and 2,688 sailing vessels of 29,573 tons arrived at Palestinian Ports; and for the half-year ending September 30th, 1921, 381 steamers of 560,837 tons, 74 men-of-war of 138,705 tons, and 2,106 sailing vessels of 29,857 tons.

Seventeen Shipping Lines call, of which the following run regular services: Khedivial, Lloyd Triestino, Servizi Maritimi, and Affréteurs Réunis, weekly; Messageries Maritimes, Fabre Line, Dutch Oriental, Dutch Levant, and Martini Italiani, bi-monthly; and the Prince Line, monthly.

Calls are made at irregular intervals by the Compagnie Russe de Navigation, Moss & Ellerman Line, Greek Line, Palestine Shipping Company, Royal Line, Dutch Lines & Co., Kerr Line.

The total length of the Palestine Railway, which are State-owned, is approximately 1,000 kilometres, including branch lines and sidings, subdivided in the following sections:

- Stand. Gauge (4'8") Section, Kantara-Haifa, 412½ Kilos.
- Ludd Section, Jaffa-Jerusalem, 98½
- Rafa-Beersheba, 59½
- Ludd-Kurnafed Military Siding, 4½
- Kafr Jinnie-Beit Nabala Quarry Siding, 3½
- Ras El Ain-Petach-Tikvah Line, 6½
- Narrow (3' 6") Section, Haifa-Acre, 17½
- Haifa-El Hammra, 65½
- Nasaret South - Amman, 86½
- Afule - Nablus, 80½
- Tulkarem, 90½
- Jenin Military Siding, 2½

The Kantara-Rafa Section known as the "Sina Military Railway" (approximately 200 kilos) is operated by the Palestine Railways on behalf of the War Office.

There is through communication with Egypt, and trains connect at Kantara West daily with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez and other parts of Egypt, railway vehicles being sent across the canal by means of a truck transporter.

North of Haifa the Palestine Railways system terminates at El Hammé, and the Section El
Hamme-Derra (Junction of the Hejaz Railway to Medina) is operated by the Hejaz Railway, which in turn is controlled by the French Government.

There are 450 kilometres of metalled roads in Palestine extensively used by motor transport, and in addition, many kilometres of tracks passable by wheeled traffic of all kinds during dry weather.

Banking and Currency.

The most important Bank in Palestine is the Anglo-Egyptian, with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Gaza. The Anglo-Palestine Company has its head office in Jaffa, with branches in Jerusalem, Haifa, Tiberias, Safed and Hebron. In addition, there are branches in Jerusalem of the Crédit Lyonnais, the Imperial Ottoman Bank, and the Banco di Roma.

There is as yet no Palestinian currency. Egyptian Bank and Currency Notes, gold, silver and nickel coins, and British gold sovereigns at the rate of 97½ piastres Egyptian, are legal tender.

Other foreign coins, previously legal tender, were demonetised on 22nd January, 1921, by a Public Notice. Trade with Transjordania is carried on in gold and Turkish silver mejdias.

The metric system is followed by the Government, and its use regulated by Ordinance, but the local weights and measures are still commonly employed.

SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. His Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 600,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 500 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained o
100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1884 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1904. The present Rajah, H.H. Charles Vyner Brooke (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 25 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses a hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 300 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Mission have stations at various other places all over the Country.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baram, Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang, Lawas, Niatu, Sarebas, Kalaka, Lundu, Miri.

Communications.

Vessels of the Sarawak Steamship Company Limited provide a service every 10 days between Kuching and Singapore; and a coasting service is maintained by that Company and by the Government.

There are roads only around the capital and thence to the mining district in Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles). To open up country in the vicinity of the capital where communication by water is not available about 10 miles of railway has been constructed and is open for traffic, and a further 10 miles is in course of construction to be increased gradually hereafter; otherwise, internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.
