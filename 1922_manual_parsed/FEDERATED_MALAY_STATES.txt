THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years previous to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters reached a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations...
were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. Clementi Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Chief Secretary and to the High Commissioner for the Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States,* to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

No further meetings of this nature have been held since 1903, as the necessity for them has been removed by an important development of the principle of Federation, which was introduced in 1909. In that year a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." The Council consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Chief Secretary, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British Residents, the Legal Adviser and four unofficial members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision is made in the agreement for the addition, if desired, of the heads of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficials. The Council meets at least once a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1903, at Kuala Kangsar.

### Railways.

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also in the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (120 miles), extending from Johore Bahru at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore Island, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas, the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Selangor, and Perak, then enters Province Wellesley, passing Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—about 472 miles from Johore Bahru, and thence proceeds through the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Siamese State Railways was opened on July 1st, 1918. The distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,188 miles.

The East Coast Line proceeds Northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan and Pahang, and is completed as far as Padang Tungku, 6 miles north of Kuala Lpis—the capital of Pahang—and 2681 miles from Johore Bahru. Between Padang Tungku and Tanah Merah in Kelantan a distance of 149 miles, the permanent location of the line has been definitely decided and construction is now proceeding northward of Padang Tungku. A section of 32 miles in Kelantan, between Tanah Merah and Tumpat, on the East coast is open for traffic, and construction is also proceeding.
southward towards Pahang. Between this section and Ootapao Junction, a section of 12 miles on the Kelantan side of the frontier, was opened in 1920, and the section from the Siamese boundary to Ootapao a distance of 145 miles was opened in November, 1921.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, and Port Weld.

At Prai, on the mainland opposite Penang, an extensive scheme of deep water Wharves is under construction.

A causeway carrying two lines of rails and a roadway is being built across the Johore Strait to connect the island of Singapore with the peninsula.

Portions of the line in the neighbourhood of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur are being doubled.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States railway administration is 1,014 miles, 67 chains.

The line is of metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant cars. The expenditure on capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was $144,134,625-50 up to 31st December, 1920, and this has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

Posts, Savings Bank, Telegraphs and Telephones.

A well organised system of Posts extends throughout the Federated Malay States by rail, motor car, cycle, runner, sea and river. All towns and villages of any size have their regular deliveries and collections of mail matter and these facilities are being extended rapidly. The external mail services are frequent to all other parts of the world through the Straits Settlements ports Singapore and Penang. The postal services include Parcel Post, Cash on Delivery (or Value Payable Post), Insurance, Money Orders, British Postal Orders, all these services extend to a great many different countries. They are operated at some 106 Post Offices by officers of the Posts and Telegraphs Department and at 31 other places by stationmasters and others. Savings Bank business is transacted at all Post Offices at all hours at which they are open, the Bank being controlled by the Department. The interest payable on deposits is at present 3 per cent.

Telegraph lines connect all the Post Offices and "Allowance Offices" with a main trunk system throughout the Peninsula, and through Singapore and Penang with the rest of the world by submarine cable and by wireless. The Malay State of Trengganu has recently been connected with this system and has thereby come into telegraphic communication with the rest of the world. The Department has its own telegraph lines through the State of Johore connecting the Federated Malay States with Singapore.

The Telephone system also extends throughout the Federated Malay States. In Perak there are 9 public exchanges (at Taiping, Ipoh, Batu Gajah, Gopeng, Kampar, Sungkai, Tapah, Teluk Anson, Tanjong Malim) all of which are in inter-communication by means of trunk lines. In Selangor and Negri Sembilan there are 10 public exchanges (at Kuala Lumpur, Kajang, Klang, Port Swettenham, Seremban, Port Dickson, Kuala Selangor, Pawang, Kuala Kubu and Banting) and these also intercommunicate. The two systems mentioned will shortly be connected by a new trunk line enabling telephonic conversation to take place between any two telephone stations west of the mountain range forming the backbone of the country. Several new exchanges are on order. The State of Patang on the east side has no public telephones but a Police system connects all the police stations. The police telephone system is erected and maintained by the Posts and Telegraphs Department.

There are 2,550 miles of telegraph and telephone lines in the Federated Malay States with a wire mileage of 12,500 miles. In addition there are 27½ miles of underground cables with a wire mileage of 2,511 miles. The Department also has 121 miles of telegraph line with a wire mileage of 365 miles in the State of Johore.

Pétrak.

H.H. Sir Paduka Sri Sultan Iskandar Shah,
K.C.M.G., ibni Idris, Sultan.

Pétrak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1876, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 7,800 square miles, is well watered, the Pétrak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Parsa, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 74,102 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Pétrak is (a) 844 of metallised and (b) 88½ of unmetalled cart roads, 1,130¼ miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Pétrak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Pétrak, and the State now includes the
whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory, which was taken over on the 16th July, 1909, and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Kian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasek on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

**Sélangor.**

H.H. Sir Ala'idin Suleiman Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni Almerhum Raja Musa, Sultan.

Sélangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Pérák, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,156 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Pérák and Sélangor, the Sélangor, the Klang and the Langat. The natives are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Pérák, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines. The population at the 1921 census was 398,434, of which 170,726 were Chinese, 132,114 Indians, 89,676 Malays, 2,475 Europeans, 1,561 Eurasians, and 1,883 others.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably, as much as 104 inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are from March to May, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Sélangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Sélangor, each under a British District Officer.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 80,356 (1921 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 69 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence.

There are 165 schools in the State, comprising one Government English School, 67 Government Vernacular Schools, 87 Grant-in-aid Vernacular Schools and 10 Grant-in-aid English Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, registered in 1920 was 2,948,414.

The total revenue of the State in 1920, was $25,697,388.72, and the expenditure $37,642,036.33.

There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. The only import duties are those charged on spirituous liquors, beers, petroleum, and tobacco. In 1920 the gross total value of imports was $102,410,392, and the export, $100,915,769.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1920 was 162,392 pikulas, valued at $24,626,737. The area alienated for mining is 67,433 acres, and a labour force of 29,129 is employed in this industry. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned owing to the fall in price. There are 62,217 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides. Most of the large estates have been converted into or sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1920 the area under rubber cultivation was approximately 409,267 acres. The value of cultivated rubber exported during 1920 was $69,296,250.

The road mileage is: metallised cart roads, 770; gravelled cart roads, 76; natural cart roads, 30; and bridle paths, 148 miles.

**Negri Sembilan (Nine States).**

H.H. Sir Muhammad, K.C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti, and Chiefs.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan dates, as at present constituted, from 1896, but a similar Federation was already in existence before that year. The present Federation consists of the following States: Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gengencheh.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungei Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at the Coast, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and at Tampin.

The total area of the State is about 2,550 square miles. The population stood at 177,981 at the census taken in 1921 and is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Tamils.

The value of imports amounted to $13,403,573 in 1920, and that of exports to $38,604,887. The revenue of the State, which in 1920 amounted to $5,942,205, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1920, 15,619 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 450,669 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the
installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemenchek and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population, numbering some $80,954, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coco-nuts.

During 1920 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:—Rubber 259,773 acres, rice 30,213 acres, and coco-nuts 11,135 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses 72 Malay vernacular schools, two English schools and one Tamil school.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 421 miles of metalled and 9 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 256 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Sultan Abdullah ibni Almerhum Sultan Ahmad Maimun Shah, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, having an estimated area of some 14,000 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming part of the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 286 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Bentong, Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast line of the Federated Malay States Railways was opened for traffic as far as Padang Tungku, 5 miles north of Kuala Lipis on 16th March, 1921.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital, which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

There is a motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 33 miles, and from Raub to Bentong, via Tras and Tranum, a distance of 30 miles; also twice weekly from Jerantut Station on the Railway to Kuantan, a distance of 109 miles.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, and from Benta to Kuantan (147½ miles), have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungei Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

The total revenue of the State during 1920 amounted to $2,956,200, and the expenditure to $4,269,822.

The census of 1921 gave a total population of 134,684.

MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

Johore had entered into a Treaty with Great Britain as early as 1855, and in 1885, the Sultan, by an agreement dated the 11th of December, placed his foreign relations under the control of the British Government. He also undertook to receive a British Agent at his Court when required to do so, but no such appointment was made until January, 1910, when, in consequence of a request received from the Sultan, Mr. D. G. Campbell, Resident of Negri Sembilan, was transferred to Johore to act as His Highness's Adviser.

In May, 1914, the Sultan suggested that, with a view to the development of the State, the Agreement of 1885 should be revised to permit the appointment of a General Adviser with powers similar to those exercised by British Residents in the Federated Malay States. His Majesty's Government accepted the proposal and a subsidiary agreement was accordingly signed by His Highness and the Governor of the Straits Settlements on the 12th of May.

The other States came under British protection in 1909 as a consequence of a Treaty, signed at Bangkok on March 10th of that year, by which Siam transferred to Great Britain all her rights over them. The transfer was formally effected in July, 1909, and British officers were then appointed to reside at the Courts of the native rulers, and to assist them in the administration of their territories.

The officer administering the Government of the Straits Settlements is His Majesty's High Commissioner for all Protected States in the Peninsula.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,500 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The area alienated for cultivation extends to some 650,000 acres of which upwards of 200,000 acres are under rubber, and a further 200,000 acres are under coconuts. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunung Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,180 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and the Johore, which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bharu, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Pengkaram in Batu Pahat. The population of Johore Bharu is about 15,000. The population of the whole State as determined at the census of 1921 is 282,244, about 56 per cent of whom are Malays.

The principal products of Johore are rubber (26,832 tons in 1920), gambier (2,821 tons), copra (18,947 tons), tapioca (8,373 tons) and arecanuts (16,213 tons).

The mineral resources of the States have hitherto been much neglected, but the discovery of a rich tin field in the East Coast has resulted in considerable activity. During 1920, the export of tin ore amounted to 1,586 tons valued at $3,996,000. Iron is found in abundance, and ore is being exported from Batu Pahat.

The public revenue in 1920 was $11,838,975 while the expenditure amounted to $13,070,283.

The public debt of the State on the 31st December, 1920, was nil.

Returns show the value of imports to be $42,877,896 (5,002,421l.), and of exports to be $68,685,787 (8,013,342l.).

The Johore State Railway, to which reference has been made above (see Federated Malay States), runs from Kuala Gemas on the Negri Sembilan
border to Johore Bharu, a distance of 120½ miles. The line, which was opened for traffic in July, 1909, was constructed by the Railway Department of the Federated Malay States, the necessary funds being lent by the Federation. It is now leased to the Federated Malay States for a period of years at an annual rental.

KEDAH.

H.H. Sir Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibni Ahmad Tajuddin, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Kedah is a State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula situated between the parallels of 5°5' and 6°35' N. lat. and the meridians of 99°36' and 101°10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (north and east) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of £10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the south. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the north of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern watershed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 105 miles in length and about 65 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi groups about 3,900 square miles. The four highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Bintang (6,103 feet), Gunong Kangar (4,760 feet), Gunong Jerai (3,978 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,823 feet). Gunong Raia, on Langkawi Island, is 2,960 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammadanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was, at various times, under the domination of Burmah, Aceh, Malacca and Siam. Like the other States, too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul, Perlis, and part of Singgora on the north, and Krian on the south, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders, its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Oppelhoofden (Commandants) in Kedah from 1654 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese, and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammed Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1841 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kelah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammadans. Only a few families of the aborigines (Sakels) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River. They numbered 100 all told at the 1911 census.

South Kedah, the area lying south of the mountain known as Kedah Peak (Gunong Jerai), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils, planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying lands along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang and to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 245,986 at the 1911 census. At the 1921 census the population was 338,644, of whom 300 were Europeans, 75 Eurasians, 237,043 Malays, 50,403 Chinese, 33,019 Indians and 8,704 "other races."

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered, with the exception of a deposit of marble which may prove to be of value.

Climate.

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the daytime rising
to over 90 deg. F. and falling to nearly 70 deg. F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply, which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

Communications.

Steamers ply between Penang and Semilling, and Yen (in South Kedah), and Sela, and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 48 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road is being pushed forward towards the Patani frontier, through Langgar. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak, and other metalled roads have been completed or are under construction. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns; 183 miles of canals are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Mertajam, in Province Wellesley and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier. Trains have been running regularly since October, 1916. A connection through Perlis, with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There is an English school and a Malay girls' school in Alor Star. There are 61 Malay schools.

Constitution.

Until the beginning of this century the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

On the 23rd July, 1905, the Sultan, by an edict, appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country.

The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud. The Adviser and the Chief Judge are ex-officio members, and two members may be nominated.

In 1913, the Sultan's health became such that it was necessary to appoint his eldest son, Tunku Ibrahim, as Regent, pending the restoration of the Sultan's health.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,600,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent. The Federated Malay States Government paid the interest, $120,953, due at the time of the transfer, and added it on to the capital, thus making the loan amount to $2,720,953.

The public revenue and expenditure during the five years A.H. 1335 (A.D. 1917) to A.H. 1339 (A.D. 1921) were respectively:

| Year       | Revenue     | Expenditure |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| A.H. 1335  | 4,584,140   | 3,240,121   |
| A.H. 1336  | 5,059,429   | 3,785,454   |
| A.H. 1337  | 4,941,484   | 4,282,038   |
| A.H. 1338  | 6,850,319   | 4,305,681   |
| A.H. 1339  | 6,710,785   | 5,900,173   |

(estimated)

The Public Debt on the 31st of December, 1920, was $2,720,953.

Trade.

Perlis.

H.H. Syed Alwi, Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula North of Kedah. Its area is 316 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano. Perlis has a bi-weekly steamer communication with Penang, and has a good system of telegraphs and telephones. There are fifteen miles of metalled roads, and thirty miles of earth roads.

The population is about 40,091. The public revenue and expenditure for the last five years were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1335 A.D. 1917 | 264,976 | 193,776 |
| A.H. 1336 A.D. 1918 | 306,924 | 247,583 |
| A.H. 1337 A.D. 1919 | 294,044 | 243,885 |
| A.H. 1338 A.D. 1920 | 443,443 | 277,994 |
| A.H. 1339 A.D. 1921 | 341,420 | 337,331 |

(estimated)

The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. The total debt of the State is now $495,394. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Advisor to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Advisor appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Advisor appointed by Great Britain.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Advisor.

Kelantan.

H.H. the Sultan Ismail bin Almerhum,
Sultan Mohamed IV.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 5° 45' and 6° 15' north, and between longitudes 101° 23' and 102° 40' east. It is bounded on the north by the China Sea; on the east by Trengganu; on the south by Pahang; and on the west by Perak and the Siamese Monthon of Petani. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,870 square miles.
As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the state according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in July, 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the south. Gunung Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabal, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1921 Census was 309,293, including 127 Europeans, 286,334 Malays, 12,779 Chinese, 3,622 Indians, and 6,396 others. A large number of Chinese agricultural labourers are now being imported for the rubber estates.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 10,800 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has a school attended by some 540 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Kuala Krai has been completed. It is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Puteh, Kuala Krai, Chehil and Bangnara. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 2,406), Bachok (population 766), on the coast, Pasir Puteh (population 858), and Kuala Krai, the head quarters of the southern district of the State. The Trunk Road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai (43 miles) affords good communication throughout the dry season and only requires a little more metalling to make it available at all seasons.

Pasir Puteh is connected by road with Kota Bharu, and the road is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, which will eventually connect Kelantan with Singapore, has been completed as regards the section between Tumpat and Tanah Merah, while communication with Penang is now established with a daily train service.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the annual harvest of which amounts to 70,000 tons. Kelantan is one of the few Malay States which export padi and rice. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years. In addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. Most of the estates have reached the tapping stage. There is now a steady output of rubber, the quality of which is of a high standard. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, though it has been necessary temporarily to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of silk sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Since the extension of British protection to Kelantan, there have been several applications for land for tin mining.

The tin mining industry is likely to increase when the railway is able to carry supplies to the back country. Recent prospecting points to a possibility of gold being found in payable quantities.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, cattle, padi and rice, betelnuts, fish, and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot, and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 103 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, but a coin made from an alloy of tin and lead and called pittis is also current in the bazaar; 480 pittis equal one dollar.

Regular steam communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

TRENGGANU.

H.H. Slemah bin Almarhum Zenalabidin, Sultan.
British Adviser, J. L. Humphreys, 1,470l.; H. C. Eckhardt, acting.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 30' and 5° 45' North, and longitude 102° 15' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 6,000 square miles.

The total population of the State, as recorded by the census taken in April, 1921, is 153,092. This total is made up as follows:

- European and kindred races ... 34
- Malay races ... 144,859
- Chinese ... 7,240
- Indians ... 215
- Other nationalities ... 744

There are no roads (except 10 miles at Kuala Trengganu), or railways; communication with the interior is entirely by means of the rivers and good native paths. Telegraphic communication will shortly be established between the State, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements. There is a telephone exchange at Kuala Trengganu.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 13,991.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretai, Dungun, Paki, Marang, Ibar, Stiu, and Besut.

The public revenue and expenditure in 1920 were £970,541 and £767,645 respectively.

The total value of exports from Trengganu in 1919, was approximately $3,544,906. The principal exports were:

- Fish (dry and salted) ... $1,499,965
- Tin ore ... 813,683
- Copra ... 366,815
- Black pepper ... 118,867
- Wolfram ore ... 102,582

The total value of imports into Trengganu from Singapore in 1920, was $1,571,789. The principal imports were:

- Rice ... $253,089
- Cotton stuffs ... 177,380
- Tobacco, cigars and cigarettes ... 228,764
- Petroleum ... 83,487

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the north-east monsoon, from November to February.

The rainfall recorded at Kretai was: in 1918, 126°70 inches; in 1919, 117°13'; and in 1920, 91°50'. The temperature ranges between 63° and 92° F., the greatest range in 24 hours being 25°. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconut, coffee, and pepper.

During part of the north-east monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable. British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909; on this date a Commissioner from the Siamese Government surrendered in the presence of the Sultan and his principal Chiefs, the suzerainty formerly exercised over the State by Siam, to a British Officer (Mr. W. L. Conlay), appointed to accompany the former to Trengganu for the purpose of notifying the transfer, and of assuming the position of British Agent resident in the State. The suzerainty of Siam was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the Bunga Mas to Bangkok. This tribute will not be rendered in future either to Siam or to Great Britain.

An Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainal Abidin was signed in Singapore on the 22nd April, 1910.

This agreement of four articles provides that mutual help shall be rendered by the two Governments, and for the rendition of fugitive criminals. It also provides for the appointment of a British Officer to reside in Trengganu to be an Agent with functions similar to those of a Consular Officer. His Majesty's Government undertake to protect the Government and the State of Trengganu and all its Dependencies from attack by foreign enemies, and the Trengganu Government surrenders the management of all political matters with Foreign Governments to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The limitation of mining and agricultural concessions to any person other than natives and subjects of Trengganu is also provided for.

This agreement was amended on May 24th, 1919. Under the amended agreement the Sultan agrees to accept a British Officer, called the British Adviser, whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues.

The ruling line of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainal Abidin, through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The State is included within the Postal Union, under the regulations approved by the Convention of Rome, on the 26th May, 1906.
