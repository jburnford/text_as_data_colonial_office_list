NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.

Situation and Area.
The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by Tanganyika Territory, on the west by the British South Africa Company's Territory known as "Northern Rhodesia," on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and has a total area of about 33,956 square miles, according to the most recent survey.

It is divided into three Provinces, each under the control of a Provincial Commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into eighteen districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate. An agent of the Government is stationed at Chinde at the mouth of the Zambesi, where a concession has been leased from the Portuguese Government as a landing and forwarding depot for goods intended for British Territory north of the Zambesi, and where a Postal Agency is also established.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 250 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.
In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yao round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shiré districts.
Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wahenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganjika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shiré and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaus at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikha arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

**Constitution.**

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Mombasa.

**Climate and Products.**

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shire Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shiré Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

**Industry.**

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, tobacco, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat and fibre.

Cotton has rapidly increased and the export reached 3,462,478 lbs. in 1916-17, but fell to 866,510 lbs. in 1917-18 owing to shipping restrictions; it rose again in 1918-19 to 2,670,834 lbs., and in 1919-20 dropped to 930,048 lbs. owing to market fluctuations. The export for the year ended 31st December, 1920, was 913,718 lbs. Tobacco shows a considerable increase, the export reaching 4,304,124 lbs., but fell to 2,025,352 lbs. in 1917-18 from the same cause. In 1918-19, 5,805,396 lbs., in 1919-20, 4,340,381 lbs. and for the year ended 31st December, 1920, 4,963,130 lbs. were exported. 95½ per cent. of the export trade was to the United Kingdom and British Colonies. Further development is greatly dependent on improved transport, as during the dry season the Shiré River is shallow.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition. 78½ per cent. of the imports in 1919-20 came from the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

**Population (31st March, 1921).**

Europeans, 1,427; Asiatics, 561; Natives, 1,199,631.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway from Port Herald, on the Lower Shire, to Blantyre, 113 miles, via Chirone and Luchenza, was built by the Shire Highlands Railway, under an agreement made in 1902 with the Nyasaland Government under which a subsidy was paid to the Railway. Subsequently the Central African Railway Co., Ltd., constructed a section, opened in 1915, from Chindio on the Zambesi to Port Herald, 61 mles, of which the first 45 are on Portuguese territory. Imports are carried by steamer from Chinde, at the mouth of the Zambesi, to Chindio, unless the railway there is flooded, in which case the steamers proceed to Port Herald. Both lines are of 3ft. 6in. gauge. A railway of the same gauge is being constructed by the Trans-Zambezia Railway Co., Ltd., from the south bank of the Zambesi to a point about 20 miles from Beira (165 miles, all in Portuguese territory). The Nyasaland Government has had under consideration a railway from Luchenza to Lake Nyasa. There are eight British steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shiré between Chinde and the railway terminus. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 3,569. There are nine steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Mails to and from England are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

The total mileage through the Protectorate is 869 miles. Telegrams may also be transmitted over the railway line and the Portuguese line between Chinde and Tete.

Education.

There are no Government schools, and native education is in the hands of the missionary societies. There are 2,414 schools, at which 133,291 natives receive instruction, which is largely practical. An annual grant of 2,200L is made by Government.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.

Banking operations in the Protectorate are governed by "The Banking Ordinance, 1902."

Two Banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited, and The National Bank of South Africa, Limited; both have branches at Zomba, and agencies at other centres.

A Post Office Savings Bank has also been established in the Protectorate.

It is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Cape Town 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 17 days, and from Cape Town, 6 days.

A census taken in April, 1921, showed a population of 3,747, of whom 49 were members of the Garrison, and 32 East African deportees.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of 1,438. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 84°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall in 1920 was 35 inches in the country. The island is very healthy. The death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants was for 1915, 14·7; for 1916, 13·6; for 1917, 13·75; for 1918, 9·85; and for 1919, 7·94; 1920, 8·87.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch held it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1665 it was seized by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they seized it, to be driven out finally in May, by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A new charter was issued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 3 schools, having 236 scholars. There are also 5 endowed and private day schools, two of which are aided by Government, having 376 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 11 of 1903, and fees of 1d. a week per child are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1920 were 824l. and 837l.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the Red Sea route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818 a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre (phormium). The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre, though, under present conditions of working, ten tons of phormium leaves give one ton of fibre and a quarter ton of tow. The industry was re-started with the help of a grant from the Home Exchequer. The Government Mill opened in 1907, but was closed down in May, 1910, on exhaustion of millable leaf. It was re-opened on 13th November, 1911, and still continues to run.

Between July, 1913, and March, 1917, three private mills were opened.

The figures in the three last years were:

| Year | Govt. | Private Mills |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1918 | 1,103 tons | 4,269 tons |
| Produced Fibre | 121 | 431 |

Land under cultivation of Flax, 1,000 acres.

A lace-making industry was established in August, 1907, with the help of a grant from Imperial funds.

Trade depends upon the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress, and has greatly diminished in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal. The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war, was, in 1917, 51; in 1919, 30; and in 1920, 37. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are phormium fibre and lace-making, fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being potatoes.

A branch of the National Bank of S. Africa was established in January, 1920. The Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1920—11,073l.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at par.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal, steamers arrive from thence at the same interval and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 6 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India, and certain Colonies is 1d. per oz.; to other parts of the world 2½d. per oz. There is no internal post, but there are 40 miles (about) of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 400l. The cable from the Cape (which is being worked by the Eastern Telegraph Company with a staff of 13, including a Superintendent) reached St. Helena at the end of 1899, and was carried forward to Ascension by February, 1900. It is completed to St. Vincent.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of His Majesty in Council.
