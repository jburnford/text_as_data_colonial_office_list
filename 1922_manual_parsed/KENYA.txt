THE KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," until recently known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the coast line from Umba River to the Juba River, and vast territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. It includes the Witu Protectorate, a small tract of country at the mouth of the Tana. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew on July 31st, 1893. Witu is now regarded for administrative purposes as part of Tanaland.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika, mandated Territory frontier to Kipini, the island of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the fort of Kismayu; these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of £7,000. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1896 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and henceforward the Sultan's dominions are styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 248,800 square miles.

A new scheme of Administration providing for the separate control of the native and the settled areas, has been approved, and is in process of introduction. The revised system is being adopted gradually, and on the 1st of January, 1921, the following divisions were in existence:

1. Jubaland Province (Headquarters, Kismayu), consisting of the districts of Kismayu, Serenli and Goaba.

2. Coastal Area (Headquarters, Mombasa), comprising the districts of Lamu, Tana River, Malindi, Mombasa (excluding the town and Island of Mombasa) and Vanga with the Nyika Reserve.

3. Ukamba Province (Headquarters, Nairobi), comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kitui, Machakos, and Teita (Voi).

4. Kikuyu Province (Headquarters, Nyeri), including the districts of Kyambu, Fort Hall, Nyeri, Embu, and Meru.

5. Nyanza Province (Headquarters, Kisumu), including the districts of Kisumu (exclusive of the township itself), Lumbwa (including Sotik and Kericho areas), Nandi, North Kavirondo, and South Kavirondo.

6. Masai Reserve (Headquarters, Narok), comprising the districts of Ngong, Narok, and Mara.

7. Kamasia and Suk Reserve (Headquarters, Ravino), including the districts of Eldama Ravine (with sub-stations of Elgeyo, Marakwet, and Kabarnet) and Kacluliba District.

Each Province and the Coastal Area is under the control of a Senior Commissioner, and a similar official is stationed at Nakuru. There is an Officer-in-Charge, Masai; and an Officer-in-Charge, Kamasia and Suk Reserves.

Resident Commissioners control the townships of Mombasa and Kisumu, as well as the settled areas of Naivasha, Trans-Nzoia, Laikipia (Headquarters, Rumuruti), Uasin Gishu (Headquarters, Eldoret).

The Military authorities are administering the Turkana tribes on the north-western confines of the Colony.

The Northern Frontier District is now under Military Control, and is administered by the O.C. 5th King's African Rifles, with headquarters at Meru.

The capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the territory. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1920-1921 | 2,339 Europeans |
|        | 9,001 Asiatic |
|        | 16,000 Native |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 30,032, of whom about 650 are Europeans. It is situated on the Eastern side of an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, on the South-Western side of the island. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the Port. Kilindini is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply and a scheme for improved harbour facilities is being carried out; in due course it will be the centre of distribution for the trade of Equatorial Africa.

The two principal rivers in the North are the Tana and Juba, which flow into the Indian Ocean. They are both navigable for about 400 miles by shallow draught steamers.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 2,529,133, including 35,982 Asiatics and 9,651 Europeans. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Masai, the Somalis and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many
The town and island on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many
Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

**Constitution.**

Following the annexation of part of the East Africa Protectorate in 1920, under the Royal Instructions dated the 11th September of that year, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner and Principal Medical Officer (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, ten ex officio members, not more than seven nominated official members, eleven European elected members, and two Indian elected members; the ex officio members to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Uganda Railway, Land Officer, Director of Agriculture, Director of Public Works, and Chief of Customs; the nominated official members to be such persons holding office in the Colony or Protectorate of Kenya as the Governor may appoint; the European elected members to be such fit persons as may be elected under the Electoral Ordinance of 1919 or any subsequent law; the Indian elected members to be such fit persons as may be elected under any law enacted for the purpose. If one of the nominated official members is not specially appointed to represent the interests of the Arab community, there shall be a nominated unofficial member to represent such interests, who shall be such Arab or other person representing such interests and not holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Mombasa, and sessions are held at Nairobi, Naivasha, Kisumu and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the East Africa Protectorate.

**Climate**

The Lowlands, or districts near the coast, are fairly healthy for the tropics. The hot season is from January to April. The Highlands, or central plateaux, have a temperate climate, the mean average temperature at noon is 78° F. July, August and September are usually cold months.

**Currency and Banks.**

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at 1s. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent. piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921, from circulation. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents, of a rupee) remain in circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (cents. of a shilling) are being introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Chief of Customs at Mombasa as Currency Officer with the Treasury Officer as Assistant.

**The National Bank of India Ltd.** (Head Office:—26 Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of British East Africa, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

**The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd.** (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

**The National Bank of South Africa, Ltd.** (Head Office:—Pretoria) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi and Eldoret.

**The Bank of India, Ltd.** (Head Office:—Bombay), have a branch at Mombasa.

**Products and Trade.**

The agricultural products of the lowlands are cocoa-nuts, rice, maize, and various native grains; cotton, sisal, sugar cane and tobacco are also cultivated. Experiments with a view to a large extension of cotton growing are being made, and the introduction of other seeds and plants of economic value is being tried. In the highlands potatoes, fruit and vegetables, maize, sim sim and beans grow freely, and are now exported; coffee, sisal, flax, sugar cane, wheat and barley are successfully cultivated, and on an increasing scale. On the uplands extensive pasture grounds are available for cattle, sheep and ostriches. The export of wool is steadily increasing. The grading of native with imported stock has made great advancement.

The forest products of the coast are gum copal and timber. Mangroves grow on the coast, acacia and ebony in the scrub forests further inland. The highland forests contain croton, olive, fig and several good timber trees. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kilwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous. Sisal and rubber are being extensively planted.

The mineral resources of the Protectorate are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to
occur abundantly in most districts; mica diatomite and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold mining began, but was discontinued. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

In recent years land has been disposed of as follows:

| Year | Freehold acres | Leasehold acres | Total acres | Agriculture acres | Grazing acres | Fibre acres | Fuel acres | Forest acres |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1915 | 16,823         | 230,156         | 246,979     | 14,204            | 232,775      | —          | —         | —           |

Communications.

The vessels of The Union Castle Line from London, via Marseilles to Durban, and the Messageries Maritimes from Marseilles to Madagascar call monthly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The Maritima Italiana now have two lines calling monthly; one steamer running as far as Zanzibar, and back to Genoa, and the other as far as Durban, and also back to Genoa, calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland.

The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintain a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool as far as Beira.

During 1921 the Holland Africa Line commenced a monthly Service from London and continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this Port.

The fortnightly Mail Service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company cargo steamers of this line occasionally run from London.

Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to two Indian firms.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway was worked as a State Railway of the Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April it should be controlled by a Central Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Colony (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes. Its length is 618 miles, with a gauge of one metre. The construction cost, including steamers, etc., to March 31st, 1921, was £7,099,706l. Nine steamers on the Lake are also worked in connection with the railway. During 1920-21 (exclusive of railway material) 268,997 tons of goods, and 708,668 passengers were carried.
