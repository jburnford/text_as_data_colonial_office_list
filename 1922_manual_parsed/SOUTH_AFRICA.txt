SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union of South Africa is constituted under the South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, ch. 9), passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 20th September, 1909. In terms of that Act the self-governing Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony become united on the 31st day of May, 1910, in a legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa, those Colonies becoming original provinces of the Union under the names of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State respectively.

The Act constituting the Union provides for the appointment by the Sovereign of a Governor-General, who, with an Executive Council (of which the members are chosen and summoned by him), administers the executive government of the Union as the Governor-General in Council. Departments of State are established by the Governor-General in Council, the Governor-General appointing not more than ten officers to administer them. Such officers are King's Ministers of State for the Union and members of the Executive Council.

The Senate consists of forty members. For ten years after the establishment of the Union eight were nominated by the Governor-General in Council and thirty-two were elected, eight for each province. The first election was made prior to the establishment of the Union by the two Houses of each of the Colonial Legislatures sitting as one body, and a vacancy will be filled by the choice of the Provincial Council in respect of whose province a vacancy occurs.

The first Senate automatically dissolved in 1920 and only two senators, who were appointed in 1920 to fill vacancies and who will sit for the full term of 10 years, still hold office. It is expected that the Senate will be brought up to full strength by nomination and selection, early in 1921.

The House of Assembly consists of 134 elected members, 51 of whom represent the Cape of Good Hope, 17 Natal, 49 Transvaal, and 17 the Orange Free State. Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent.

The qualifications of voters are the same as in the Colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership.

[In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise was restricted to white men; in Natal a native could obtain a vote, but under conditions which made this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native could do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.]

Pretoria is the capital and seat of government of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Legislature.

The first Parliamentary Election under the South Africa Act was held on the 15th September, 1910, and the Union Parliament was opened by H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught, K.G.

Provinces.

A Provincial Council in each province has power to legislate by ordinance on certain subjects specified in the Act, and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. The specified subjects include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for five years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game preservation and other purely local or private matters. In addition the Union Parliament may delegate the power of making Ordinances on any subject to Provincial Councils. All ordinances passed by a Provincial Council are subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Members of the Provincial Council are elected on the same system as members of Parliament, but the restriction as to European descent does not apply. The number of members in each Provincial Council is as follows:

- Cape of Good Hope ... ... ... ... 51
- Natal ... ... ... ... ... 25
- Transvaal ... ... ... ... ... 49
- Orange Free State ... ... ... ... ... 25

The first Provincial elections for the Cape of Good Hope and the Transvaal were held on the 15th September, 1910; those for Natal and the Orange Free State on the 12th October, 1910.

The executive power in the subjects on which the Provincial Council is empowered to make ordinances is vested in an Executive Committee consisting of an Administrator, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and four members elected by the Provincial Council.

Areas and Population.

| Area, Square Miles | Population, Census, May, 1921 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Cape of Good Hope | 276,966 | 2,781,185 |
| Natal | 35,284 | 1,427,431 |
| Transvaal | 110,450 | 2,085,837 |
| Orange Free State | 50,389 | 628,360 |

Total... | 473,089 | 6,922,813 |

Of the total 6,922,813 persons (1921), 3,534,171 were males and 3,388,642 females.

The increase for the Union (1911-21) was 15·89 per cent. For the Provinces it was as follows: — Cape, 8·43 per cent.; Natal, 19·55 per cent.; Transvaal, 23·70 per cent.; Orange Free State, 18·97 per cent.

The population comprised (1921) 1,522,924 Europeans or whites (739,227 females); 5,399,889 coloured persons (natives, Asiatics, and other

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Natal Province.

The climate of the Natal Province varies at different levels. On the coast-line it is subtropical, but is considerably modified inland owing to increased altitude. Thus Umsinti in the south near the coast, at an altitude of 400 feet, has a mean annual temperature of 69°2'; Durban (261 feet), 70°8'; whilst Howick, at an elevation of 3,439 feet, has an average yearly temperature of 63°0'. In the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced. Snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer and the sky is bright throughout the winter months. Hot winds occasionally occur towards the end of the year (September-November), when temperatures of 100° to 110° may be recorded. At Pietermaritzburg (2,200 feet) the annual temperature is 66°6', with an average maximum of 79°9' and a minimum of 53°4'. The warmest days occur in February, when the mean maximum averages 85°3' and the coldest nights in June, when the mean minimum is 41°3'. Again, Weenen (2,540 feet), situated in a deep cup-shaped valley, has a mean annual temperature of 66°4', the mean maximum being 83°7' and the mean minimum 49°2'; the hottest month is January, when the mean maximum is 92°3', and the coldest nights are experienced in July, when the mean minimum is only 31°4'.

The average rainfall over the Province is approximately 34 inches, being about 40 inches along the coast belt (Durban 43-45 inches) and mostly about 30-00 inches inland, but decreasing to 26-37 inches at Weenen. Thunderstorms are frequent and destructive hailstorms are common during the summer months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

Transvaal Province.

Owing to the altitude (4,000 to 6,000 feet) of the plateau constituting the greater part of the Transvaal Province, the climate on the whole is healthy, cool and bracing; over the Lowveld to the north and east, however, it is hot and fever-stricken, and not at all adapted for stock owing to various endemic diseases. During summer the days are hot, occasionally exceeding 100 deg., but tempered by frequent thunderstorms, while the nights are mild to warm. During the winter months (April to September) the days are usually bright, sunny and almost cloudless, being frequently almost as warm as in summer, while the nights are cold with frequent frost and haze or fog. The rainfall is greatest in the east, Woodbush in the north-east (Zoutpansberg District) having an average of 72-53 inches in 138 days; it decreases rapidly, however, westward from the escarpment falling to about 18 inches in the extreme south-west of the Province. The mean annual temperature shows considerable variation according to position and altitude; thus, Volkrust in the south-east, near the Natal border, at an elevation of 5,300 feet, has an annual temperature of 56°9 deg., whilst Komati Poort, bordering Portuguese East Africa, at a height of only 460 feet above sea level, has an

---

average temperature of 73°1 deg. Pretoria, the administrative capital, has an annual average temperature of 63°5 deg., with a rainfall of 29°68 inches; the warmest days there occur in December, when the mean maximum is 84°0 deg., whereas the coldest nights are met with during July, when the mean minimum is 34°8 deg. The warmest month, however, is January, with a mean of 71°8 deg., and the coldest July, with 51°7 deg. The town of Johannesburg has a mean yearly temperature of 59°9 deg., with an average rainfall of 31°96 inches. Although the mean warmest month there is also January (67°5 deg.), the warmest days occur in December, when the mean maximum is 79°4 deg., and the coldest nights in July, when the mean minimum is 37°3 deg., and the monthly temperature 49°5 deg. Duststorms are frequent during the latter part of August and throughout September. Thunderstorms also are frequent during summer, more particularly from November to January, and destructive hailstorms are apt to occur at this season, destroying trees and crops. Strong, biting, cold, southerly winds blow from time to time during the winter, although the prevalent winds are mostly northerly.

Orange Free State Province.

The Orange Free State can be separated, roughly, into three divisions, viz., the Western, the Middle and the Eastern.

The Western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile. Rainfall averages 15 to 20 inches.

The Middle division, through which the main line railway runs, holds moisture longer than the Western division. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock. Rainfall averages 20 to 25 inches.

The Eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe. Rainfall averages 25 to 30 inches.

The heat, especially in the Middle and Western divisions, is great during the months of December, January and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein (altitude 4,510 feet above the sea) has risen on individual days to 102 deg. Fahr. at noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 74 deg. and the mean minimum 48 deg.

The Eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein:—January, 3°79 inches; February, 3°27; March, 3°60; April, 1°95; May, 1°16; June, 0°41; July, 0°34; August, 0°46; September, 0°87; October, 1°67; November, 2°14; December, 2°39. Total 22°06 inches.

Vital Statistics.

In the Cape Province the European birth-rate in 1920 was computed to be 28°75 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 11°47 per 1,000. As the registration of births and deaths amongst the coloured population is imperfect, the birth and death rates cannot be calculated accurately.

In the Transvaal Province the European birthrate in 1920 was computed to be 30°61 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 11°14 per 1,000.

In the Orange Free State Province the European birth-rate in 1920 was computed to be 26°99 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 9°73 per 1,000. In Natal Province the European birth-rate in 1920 was computed to be 24°76 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 11°02.

The European birth and death rates in 1920 for the Union were 28°86 and 11°10 per 1,000 respectively.

In 1920, the European marriage rates for the Union and Provinces were:—Union, 9°87 per 1,000; Cape of Good Hope, 9°76 per 1,000; Natal, 10°14 per 1,000; Transvaal, 10°01 per 1,000; and Orange Free State, 9°64 per 1,000.

Railways and Harbours.

During 1920, 3,732 vessels of 9,782,955 tons net entered the harbours of the Union.

Prior to Union, which took effect in May, 1910, the state railways of the several colonies now comprising the Union were operated by the separate Governments. In May, 1910, the Government lines were merged into one system, the South African Railways, under the control of the Union Government. The total open mileage of this system at 31st March, 1921, was 9,559 miles (comprising Cape 4,254, Orange Free State 1,342, Transvaal 2,644, and Natal 1,319), of which 8,988 miles are 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and 561 miles 2 ft. gauge.

The capital expenditure on Government railways up to 31st March, 1921, amounted to £99,821,886.

The gross earnings for 1920-21 were £23,618,457/-, and the net loss after payment of interest £1,272,972/.

Working expenditure (including renewals), amounted to £18,646,913/., or 78°95 per cent. of the gross revenue, as compared with £15,126,003/., or 78°9 per cent. of the gross revenue in the preceding year.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. All Union ports are now under the direct control of the Department of Railways and Harbours.

Table Bay.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater 3,640 feet long and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 67 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 75½ acres, with about 2½ miles of berthing, and a depth ranging from 20 to 37 feet at low water. The normal capacity of the docks is 8,000 tons per diem. There is also a graving dock of 500 feet capacity on the keel blocks, with a depth of 25 feet over the sill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T., and a slip is available for vessels up to 600 tons.

Port Elizabeth.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet and 1,204 feet respectively long, and a third jetty, 1,460 feet long.

There is also a slipway capable of carrying vessels of 400 tons dead weight drawing 9 feet 3 inches to 14 feet 7 inches at H.W.O.S.T.

The existing capacity of the Port so far as safe anchorage is concerned is very large, and is limited only by the available appliances for landing and shipping. These can handle approximately 6,000 tons of cargo per diem.

A scheme has been approved by Government for the provision of large sheltering works. The proposal involves the construction of a solid breakwater extending in continuation of the Dom Pedro Jetty for about 3,000 feet in an easterly
direction, when it changes its course to a northerly direction for about another 5,500 feet.

This breakwater will shelter the anchorage up to a depth of 6½ fathoms.

The estimated cost of this proposed breakwater was £1,500,000. The scheme was deferred on account of the European war. Arrangements have now been made to proceed with the work.

East London.

The port of East London is situated at the mouth of the Buffalo River, the entrance being protected by a solid breakwater and training walls. The dock area is 100 acres in extent. Vessels drawing up to 25 feet draught and of over 8,000 tons gross register enter the river and discharge alongside the wharfs, the total length of which amounts to about 5,000 feet. A patent slip provides every facility for effecting repairs to vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight.

The proposal to extend the breakwater and works on the east bank at a cost of £400,000 is in abeyance. Meantime the work of removing a portion of the old eastern training wall and wreck of dredger "Lucy" to improve entrance to the harbour is in hand.

Durban.

Durban harbour is accessible at all times to the largest vessels navigating southern waters.

The harbour is approached through the Bluff Channel, 4,000 feet in length, formed by a north pier and a south breakwater. The width and depth of channel vary, but nowhere is there a less width than 400 feet or a less depth than 31 feet (L.W.O.S.T.). The land-locked bay inside these piers extends about 34 miles east and west, and nearly two miles north and south. The wharves have a length of 2½ miles, with depths alongside of from 23 feet to 38 feet, 6 inches L.W.O.S.T. The deep-water space available for shipping covers about one-ninth of the area, and gives a low-water depth of not less than 30 feet over its greater part.

There is a floating dock of the following dimensions:

- Length: 475 feet.
- Breadth: 70 feet.
- Draught over keel block: 23 feet.

It has been decided to build a graving dock at this Port at an estimated cost of £1,354,465. It is intended that the dimensions of the dock shall be 1,030 feet in length, 110 feet broad at entrance, 41 feet deep on silt at H.W.O.S.T., or 35 feet deep at low water. It will be seen, therefore, that the new dock will accommodate a vessel of larger dimensions than the latest dock at Panama. The construction of the dock is in hand and will take approximately another four years to complete.

Sea and Land Communications.

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Union Government, leave England and the Union (Table Bay) weekly on Fridays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 6 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. As a rule the calls at St. Helena and Ascension are made by the Intermediate steamers under agreement with the Imperial Post Office. The distance by sea from England to the Union varies from 5,966 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, are also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five. The Union-Castle Company also has a service rid the Eastern route (through the Suez Canal), steamers sailing usually every 28 days, both outwards and homewards. Owing to losses during the war and to the fact that some of the vessels requisitioned by the Imperial authorities have not yet been reconditioned, the above services, except the mail services, are somewhat modified.

A frequent service to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund's Blue Anchor Line, and the White Star Line.

There is a mail Service with Mauritius and East Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.), once or twice a month and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. There are also two direct lines of Steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is 26 days.

Passenger train services afford communication between all the principal towns in the Union several times each week; with Rhodesia three times a week, and with Lourenço Marques four times a week. Mail trains depart from Cape Town daily, except Sundays, at 11 a.m. for the North and at 9.15 p.m. daily, except Sundays, for Eastern portions of Cape Province, Orange Free State, Transvaal and Natal. Return trains depart from Pretoria at 7.20 p.m., and Johannesburg at 10.0 p.m., daily, except Wednesdays, for Cape Town rid Kimberley, and daily, except Saturdays, rid Orange Free State, from Johannesburg at 9.0 p.m., arriving at Cape Town on the third afternoon in each case. An additional train also departs from Pretoria at 5.20 p.m., and Johannesburg at 6.30 p.m. on Wednesdays, run rid Orange Free State, and is due to arrive at Cape Town at 10.21 a.m. on Fridays. This train connects with the Mail steamer for Europe.

On Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays a train departs from Cape Town at 11.0 a.m. for Rhodesia. Connection from Transvaal is made at Mafeking by 7.0 p.m. train from Johannesburg on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays. Buluwayo is reached at 7.25 a.m. on Thursdays, Saturdays and Tuesdays from which station connecting trains are run to Victoria Falls, the Congo, Salisbury and Beira. In the opposite direction trains depart from Buluwayo at 5.0 p.m. on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and are due to arrive at Johannesburg at 4.24 a.m., Pretoria at 8.31 a.m., on Thursdays, Saturdays, Mondays, and Cape Town at 9.22 a.m. on Fridays, Sundays, Tuesdays.

A train conveying the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer is despatched from the docks Cape Town to all parts of South Africa.

Mail trains depart from Durban at 5.00 p.m. and 8.40 p.m. daily for Johannesburg and Pretoria. In the return direction trains depart from Johannesburg at 9.30 a.m., and 8.45 p.m. daily for Durban.

Posts and Telegraphs.

At the end of 1920 there were in the Union 2,665 post offices, and 1,833 telegraph offices.

During the year 228,809,308 articles of mail matter were posted addressed to places within and without the Union. 2,223,468 of the articles
posted were registered; 7,740,594 telegrams of all classes were forwarded; there were 12,919 wireless messages handled, and approximately 97,093,000 telephone calls. The number of money orders issued was 447,879 of a total value of 3,555,849L, while the number paid was 422,047 of a total value of 3,480,726L. Postal orders issued numbered 3,146,708 amounting to 1,842,172L in value, and the number paid was 2,879,598, valued at 1,682,780L.

The revenue and expenditure in respect of the postal service during 1920 amounted to 1,573,190L, and 1,973,683L respectively, and the telegraph and telephone revenue was 1,211,949L against an expenditure of 1,371,542L.

44,450 miles of telegraph wire, and 29,447 telephone exchange lines were open.

The number of depositors in the Government Savings Bank at 31st March, 1921, was 308,140, and the total amount standing to their credit £6,861,070L.

The Union is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent by the Western route, and via Zanzibar and Aden by the Eastern route, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Mauritius and Cocos.

Wireless Installations have been established at Cape Town, Durban (Port Natal) and Port Elizabeth. The Cape Town and Durban stations have an effective daylight range of 1,000 miles, and the Port Elizabeth station of 300 miles; these distances are considerably exceeded in night operations, which have been successfully carried out over more than 2,000 miles at Cape Town and Durban and 1,000 miles at Port Elizabeth.

The rates of postage are:

Customs and Excise.

The four self-governing Colonies prior to the operation of the Act of Union gave notice to the Administrations of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia of their intention to retire from the South African Customs Union Convention in terms of Article xxiii. of that Convention, with effect from 30th June, 1910; and subsequently, on the consummation of the Union of South Africa, an agreement was concluded with these Administrations to continue all the essential features of the previous Customs Convention, which agreement has been subsequently amended to permit of freedom of charges for excise. The effects of the amended agreements are:

(a) The free interchange of the produce and manufactures of the Provinces of the Union, and the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, excepting any goods upon which either Government imposes any excise duties.

(b) The collection by and payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of the duties imposed by the late Convention Tariff on goods intended for consumption in the said Territories, or vice versa, subject to a collecting charge of 5 per cent.; and

(c) The payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of 95 per cent. of the duty collected on imported materials which are contained to an appreciable extent in Union manufactures, and vice versa, entered for removal to the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Union of South Africa, as the case may be.

The Agreement continued in force until the 30th of June, 1911, and thereafter for periods of twelve months, subject to three months' notice by either party of its intention to retire therefrom as from the 30th June following such notice. It now applies to Northern Rhodesia, into which North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia were merged. If, however, either party amend the Customs Tariff, or take any steps in conflict with the spirit and intent of this Agreement, the other is at liberty to retire forthwith.

For like reasons a Customs Agreement has been entered into between the Government of the Union and His Majesty's High Commissioner on behalf of the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland. The agreement is in all essentials identical to that referred to above, except that instead of a collecting charge of 5 per cent. on all duties collected, and the payment of 95 per cent. of any duty collected on imported materials contained in Union manufactures, the basis laid down in Section No. 12 of the South Africa Act, 1909, for the adjustment of duties between the parties to the Agreement is followed, viz.: The Treasury of the Union will pay out quarterly a sum in respect of such duties which shall bear to the total Customs revenue of the Union in each year the same proportion as the average amount of the Customs revenue of such Territories for the three completed financial years last preceding the taking effect of the South Africa Act 1909. The Territories collect their own excise duties on spirits and beer.

The Transvaal Province continues, under the terms of the Transvaal-Mozambique Convention, to admit the products and manufactures of the Province of Mozambique, except spirits, free of duty, but such products and manufactures are liable to the Union import duty if removed to another Province in the Union or to Southern or Northern Rhodesia, or to the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland.

A uniform rate of excise duty now applies throughout the Union on spirits distilled, or beer brewed, within the Union, except in the case of spirits distilled from the products of the sugar-cane, on which, when removed from consumption outside Natal, an additional excise duty is levied.

A rebate of the whole excise duty is granted on methylated spirits, on spirits used in the fortification of pure wine and on spirits exported, and a rebate of part duty on plain spirits used in any art or manufacture.

An excise duty is also levied throughout the Union on acetic and pyroligneous acids, extracts and essences of vinegar.

Excise is levied by means of stamps on cigarettes manufactured in the Union, or in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland, when entered for consumption in the Union, or in these Territories, and an equivalent surtax is levied on imported cigarettes, whether from overseas or from Southern or Northern Rhodesia.

The principle of granting a rebate of Customs duties on all goods the growth or manufacture of the United Kingdom is maintained; likewise of granting such rebate of Customs duties to those British Colonies and Possessions which grant an equivalent rebate to the products and manufactures of the Union of South Africa.
All duties are rebated on goods in transit through any part of the Union to places outside the Union.

The duty paid on bond fide samples of commercial travellers is refunded if the samples are exported within twelve months from the date of importation.

A refund of the duty originally paid will be made on all articles not intended for consumption in the Union imported by bond fide tourists for their use while in the Union provided such articles are exported within six months from the date of importation. As regards tourists' motor cars the triptyque system is in vogue.

Commerce.

The total value of the imports and exports of the Union, exclusive of specie, has been as follows:

Money, Weights and Measures.

The coins and the standard weights and measures are British, but the following old Dutch measures are still used: Liquid Measure: Leaguer—about 128 imperial gallons; half aum = 1½ imperial gallons; anker = 7½ imperial gallons. Capacity: muid = 3 bushels. The general surface measure is Morgen, equal to 2:1165402 acres; 1,000 Cape lineal feet are equal to 1,033 British imperial feet. Recently a Bill was introduced to provide for the standardization of the metric system for weights and measures, with the optional use of imperial standards, except in the case of chemists, who are compelled to use the metric system.

Land Administration.

Union of South Africa.

The Land Settlement Act (No. 12 of 1912), as amended by Act No. 23 of 1917, provides inter alia, for the purchase by government of private farms for persons able to pay not less than one-fifth of the purchase price of such farms in cash, the remainder of the purchase price including inspection, survey and transfer costs (if any) and an amount representing 4 per cent. for the first and second years, being repayable in thirty-six equal half-yearly instalments, including capital and interest calculated from the date of purchase at the rate of four per cent. per annum. No instalments are payable during the first and second years of the lease. The Act also provides for the disposal of Crown land, and any land the government may under this Act acquire from private persons, on lease for five years with option of purchase to approved applicants. One important condition of the allotment is that of continuous personal occupation of the land by the lessees. Advances may be made to lessees for the purchase of stock, implements, seeds and other things necessary for the development and working of the holding, but such advances must not exceed 500l. at any time. The Minister of Lands, on the recommendation of a Land Board, may cause boring operations to be effected or improvements of a substantial and permanent nature to be constructed and add the cost thereof to the valuation of the holding.

The Act lays down the qualifications of intending lessees, and prescribes that they must possess capital sufficient for beneficially developing and working the holding applied for.

Not less than ten years after the date of commencement of a lease, a lessee is entitled to a Crown grant of his own holding, provided the purchase price instalments have been paid and the provisions of the Act have been complied with.

The estimated area of unalienated Crown Land, at the 31st March, 1921, very little of which is available at present for agricultural or pastoral purposes, was:

- Cape of Good Hope . . . 12,417,000 morgen.*
- Natal . . . . 1,091,000 "
- Transvaal . . . . 6,478,000 "
- Orange Free State . . . Few farms only."

Geological Survey.

The geological survey of the Transvaal, together with what was formerly the Cape geological commission, have been incorporated together as the geological survey of the Union of South Africa, under the direction of A. W. Rogers, Sc.D.

*1 morgen = 2:1165 acres (approx.).

The publications consist of annual reports, memoirs and maps.

Forests.

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Union of South Africa in March, 1921, was approximately 2,229,000 acres. The timbered area is approximately 500,000 acres, of which some 86,343 acres consist of artificial forests termed plantations. The attention of the government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown forests. The Union is divided into seven conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests, stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna, Umtata, Pretoria, Maritzburg and Bloemfontein respectively, who is responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Union at Pretoria. The annual importation of pine timber into the Union before the war was about 10,000,000 cubic feet, derived from Europe and America. Expenditure on forests, including Railway Sleeper Plantations, for financial year 1920–21, 304,376l., cash revenue 123,549l.; value of gratis issue from forest estate, 12,518l.; total revenue 136,067l. Timber production on forest estate during 1920–21, aggregated 5,847,102 cubic feet.

Instruction.

In the South Africa Act, Section 85 (iii), it is provided that "Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides," shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the respective Provincial Councils. For practical purposes it has been provisionally determined that all post matriculation instruction shall be deemed to constitute higher education.

The Department of Education, under the Minister, was thereby placed in control of:

(1) The University of the Cape of Good Hope, Capetown, established in 1873. It was empowered to grant degrees, but it had no attached teaching institutions. (2) The South African College, Capetown, founded in 1829. (3) Victoria College, Stellenbosch, incorporated in 1831. (4) Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, incorporated in 1904. (5) Huguenot College, Wellington, incorporated in 1907. (6) Grey University College, Bloemfontein, incorporated in 1910. (7) Transvaal University College, Pretoria, incorporated in 1910. (8) South African School of Mines, and Technology, Johannesburg, incorporated in 1910. (9) Natal University College, Pietermaritzburg, incorporated in 1909. The department has also under its administration the training of first-class teachers.

In the session of 1916 three Acts were passed providing for the conversion of the South African College into the University of Capetown; of the Victoria College into the University of Stellenbosch; and of the University of the Cape of Good Hope into a Federal University with the remainder of the University Colleges as constituent Colleges. The last-named University to be styled the University of South Africa, with its seat at Pretoria. April 2nd, 1918, was fixed as the "appointed day," and on that date the new order of things came into force.

The total number of students at the above Colleges in December, 1920, was 2,901 and the State expenditure on higher education during 1920, was 235,000l.

Provision is made on the vote of the department of a grant-in-aid to the South African Native
College at Alice, Cape Province, an institution for the higher education of natives, which was formally opened in February, 1916, and at the end of the 1919 Session (December), had 41 students. The administration of the Children's Protection Act, 1913, and the Government Industrial Schools established thereunder has recently been transferred to this department.

Native Affairs.

Cape: The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amakosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs and others living along the Orange River took up arms against the colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate with a body of police was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up and the special commissioner recalled on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now part of the Cape Province.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve and Nomans Land were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Krel, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then commandant of the frontier armed and mounted police. Their territory was overrun, and Krel deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-6 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Goalekaland, and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland and Goalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the chief Krel requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the chief of the Bomvanas. Fairl, chief of the Amatsehi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondoisi tribe, under the chiefs Uindithawa and Umhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The port at the St. John's River mouth was annexed to the Colony in 1884, and Customs dues are now levied there under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881.

By Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Nqwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the chief Nqwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The District of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now within the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and are grouped under one Chief Magistrate, who is stationed at Umtata, while there are 29 subordinate magistrates. Griqualand East with a population of 3,880 Europeans, 230,574 Bantu, +4,520 mixed, has nine magistrates; Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, with a population of 4,204 Europeans, 225,087 Bantu, +1,821 mixed, has seven magistrates; Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Goalekaland, with population of 2,219 Europeans, 136,318 Bantu, +209 mixed, has six magistrates; Pondoland, comprising East and West Pondoland and Port St. John's, with a population of 1,311 Europeans, 231,682 Bantu, +1,249 mixed, has seven magistrates.

Natal and Zululand.—In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was despatched against the tribe and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "Native Law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch law and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters; a concurrent juris-

diction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime, *Mala in se*. This system of Government remains in operation at the present time, under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11, of 1865; but at the same time and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may, in certain cases, apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A Law No. 26 of 1875, established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1890, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates Courts.

As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work so well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875, the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1/ per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903, to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust for occupation by natives is about 2,400,000 acres, the land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

**Defence.**

The South African Defence Act, 1912, became law on the 14th of June, 1912.

This Act provides for the establishment of Defence Forces, comprising:—

(1) a Permanent Force,
(2) a Coast Garrison Force,
(3) a Citizen Force,
(4) a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and
(5) Special Reserves.

Every citizen between the ages of 17 and 60 is liable to render personal service in time of war and those between 21 and 25 are liable to undergo a prescribed peace training with the Active Citizen Force spread over a period of four consecutive years. The Act states, however, that only 50 per cent. of the total number liable to peace training shall actually undergo that training unless Parliament makes financial provision for the training of a greater number.

The establishment of Rifle Associations is a marked feature of the Act; citizens between the ages of 21 and 25 who are not entered for peace training with the Active Citizen Force are to be compelled to undergo training during these four years in a Rifle Association, thus ensuring that, in course of time, all citizens will at least know how to handle and use a rifle.

Provision is also made in the Act for the cadet training of boys between 13 and 17 in urban and other populous areas where facilities can conveniently be arranged.

Existing Militia and Volunteer units established under the late Colonial Governments have been embodied in the Active Citizen Force.

The permanent force—South African Mounted Riflemen—was established on the 1st April, 1913, and the training of the personnel for the permanent batteries has been undertaken and the training commenced.

The Union has been divided into 15 military districts. To each military district has been allotted various units of different arms, to which the citizens entered for peace training in their 20th and 21st years are now to be posted.

The establishments of units have been fixed, regulations have been prepared, and the Cape Garrison Artillery has been constituted as the First Division of the South African Garrison Artillery, and a movable armament company of Garrison Artillery has been formed at Durban by the transfer of the personnel of two batteries of the late Field Artillery Militia of Natal.

Cape of Good Hope Province.

Extent and Boundaries.
The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Province of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange Free State and Natal Provinces. The Cape Province, with the Transkei, contains an area of 276,966 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 26 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequenas, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mono), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walvis Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of
Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tamboekieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayliff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed. Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1896, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1896.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the Huarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeek, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen," at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted.

An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £50,000 to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:

(1) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question.
(2) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war.
(3) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation.

Population.

The Census of 1918 showed the following European population: Colony proper, 583,021;
E. Griqualand, 5,826; Tembuland, 4,292; Transkei, 2,228; Walhalla Bay, 151; Pondoland, 1,311; Bechuanaland, 18,716; giving a total of 618,825, of whom 311,312 were males, and 307,513 females. In 1921 the population of the Cape Province was 2,781,185, of whom 651,554 were Europeans (329,934 males, 321,620 females) and 2,129,631 were coloured (1,017,368 males, 1,112,262 females).

The number of European births registered in 1920 was 18,425, the number of deaths 7,352, and of marriages 6,336.

(Note.—Population figures for 1921 are preliminary and unaudited.)

Constitution and Government.

The Colony of the Cape of Good Hope was originally founded by the Dutch in the year 1652. Great Britain took possession of it in 1795, but evacuated it in 1803. A British force again took possession in 1806, and the Colony has remained a British Possession since that date. It was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Convention of London, August 13th, 1814. The original Colony has been extended from time to time. East and West Pondoland were annexed in 1894 and Bechuanaland in 1895. For many years the form of Government in the Colony depended on the terms of the Royal Letters Patent and Instructions to Governors. Letter Patent issued in 1860 to Governor Sir Henry Smith declared that in the Colony there should be a Parliament which should consist of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly.

A Constitution Ordinance was enacted by Order in Council of March 11th, 1863, and took effect on May 1st ensuing. This Order in Council provided that nothing it contained should prevent the Parliament of the Colony from making Acts (subject to the power of Her Majesty in Council either to disallow or assent to such Acts) in amendment of the said Ordinance. This power of amending the Constitution was exercised from time to time as the bounds of the Colony were extended. In 1872 an Act was passed at the Cape and assented to by Order of the Council providing for the system of Executive Administration known as Responsible Government. The Constitution formed under these various Acts vested the Executive in the Governor and an Executive Council, composed of certain office holders appointed by the Crown. On the 31st May, 1910, the Colony was merged in the Union of South Africa, thereafter forming an original Province of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Provincial Administration.

The Colony is divided into 119 Magisterial districts, and the Colony proper, including Bechuanaland, but exclusive of the Transkeian territories, into 89 Fiscal Divisions. In each Division there is a Civil Commissioner, who is, in all cases where the Fiscal and Magisterial areas coincide, also the Resident Magistrate. Each Division has a Council of at least six members (14 in the Cape Division), elected triennially by the owners or occupiers of immovable property. These Councils look after roads, boundaries and beacons; return three members to the Licensing Court, and perform other local duties.

There are 129 Municipalities, each governed by a Mayor, or Chairman and Councillors, a certain number of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. There are also 72 Village Management Boards.

The Province is divided into 123 School Districts, each under the control of a School Board, two-thirds of the members being locally elected, and one-third nominated partly by Government and partly by Municipal or Divisional Councils. Education is compulsory for children of European extraction. The School Boards derive their revenue to the extent of 72·85 per cent. from the Central Government, 24·84 per cent. from school fees, and 2·31 per cent. from other sources. Mission schools for non-European pupils are also aided by the Government, the principal of aid in the case of salaries being met in full from government. Free education up to Standard 6 was introduced as from the 1st July, 1920.

Aided schools, June 30th, 1921, 4,671; enrolment, 291,873; attendance, 262,139. There are 133,087 European pupils and 158,786 non-European. Total number of teachers, 10,883.

Provincial expenditure on Education (excluding Higher Education which is under the control of the Central Government), 1910-11, £558,194; 1911-12, £663,662; 1912-13, £784,714; 1913-14, £853,448; 1914-15, £919,485; 1915-16, £917,866;
1916-17, £976,294; 1917-18, £1,150,325; 1918-19, £1,390,958; 1919-20, £1,676,207; 1920-21, £2,000,083.

In the state-aided hospitals in the province 122,101 out-patients, and 24,725 in-patients, were treated during the year 1920. In the Government chronic sick hospitals 1,141 persons received Indoor Relief during the year.

**Fisheries.**

This subject has been engaging the attention of the Cape Provincial Government since the inception of Union.

Under the Fisheries Ordinance which was passed in 1920, regulations were promulgated providing for the better protection of both sea and fresh-water fish. Fishing boats employed for purposes of profit are now licensed and registered, and a licence is also necessary before trout can be caught in any of the public waters of the Cape Province.

The license fee to catch Trout is £1 during the open season, which is, in the case of the Western Area, including all Divisions situate West of the Eastern boundaries of the Divisions of Knyana, George, Oudtshoorn, Prince Albert, Beaufort West, Victoria West, Britstown and Hope Town: (1) in rivers, between the 1st day of October in any year and the 30th day of April in the following year, both days inclusive, (2) in vlei, between the 15th day of September in any year and the 31st day of March in the following year, both days inclusive; (3) in the Eerste River, Division of Stellenbosch, from 1st October in any year, to the 31st January, in the following year, both days inclusive; (4) in the rivers in the Division of Ceres, from the 1st October to the 31st December and from the 1st March to 31st May, both days inclusive; and in the Eastern Area including the Transkeian Territories and all Divisions situate East of the boundary of the Western portion of the Province as defined above. (1) In the Rivers in the Eastern Area, excepting those in the Transkeian Territories between the 1st of October in any year and the 30th of April in the following year, both days inclusive. (2) In the rivers throughout the whole of the Transkeian Territories, between the 16th of September in any year and the 15th of April in the following year, both days inclusive.

Scientific investigations into the habits and spawning seasons of various kinds of fish are also carried on at the Aquarium at St. James, under the direction of Dr. Gilchrist, Fishery Adviser to the Cape Provincial Government.

PROVINCE OF NATAL.

Area and Population.

Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from Cape Town, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange Free State and Basutoland, and on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and Umtamvuna River. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. Pietermaritzburg is the seat of the Provincial Government, and has a population of 35,077; the largest town and only port is Durban.

The Province (including Zululand, 10,424 square miles) has an area of 35,284 square miles, with a seaboard of about 360 miles. The climate is sub-tropical on the coast and somewhat colder inland. It is well suited to Europeans. The Province is divided into 40 Magisterial Divisions.

The European population has more than trebled since 1879. The returns of the total population in 1891, 1901 and at the Censuses of April 17th, 1904, May 7th, 1911, and European Census of May 5th, 1918, and estimated coloured population, 1918, were:

| Year     | Europeans | Indians and Asiatics | Natives | Totals |

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonise it. Tshaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingana, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Tshaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Boers obtained a decisive victory, and placed Mpande, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingana, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the South African Republic (as the Transvaal was at that time called) and Orange Free State on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other, Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and
that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation of Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and a Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotshe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas; total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,970 square miles.

Zululand und Tongatland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Tshaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Tshaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingana in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Mpande. In the latter years of Mpande Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Mpande's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetshwayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetshwayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetshwayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetshwayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetshwayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetshwayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Ivanezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginhlou, on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetshwayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetshwayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Tshaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetshwayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatuze River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatuze and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a
British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetshwayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Umutu (the name by which the personal adherents of Cetshwayo—as distinct from the Zulus in general—were known), finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetshwayo, as King; but it was soon checked, with the assistance of the Imperial troops, and Dinuzulu with his uncles Ndaduko and Tshingana were arrested, tried and convicted of high treason, and removed to St. Helena, while other offenders were tried on other charges, and imprisoned or fined. Dinuzulu and his two uncles were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1898.

In 1890 Tongaland and the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Mbikiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Tongaland, also called Maputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongolo with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Tongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the Colonial forces, with assistance from detachments of volunteers from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

In 1907 there was a further recrudescence of unrest amongst the natives in Zululand, which was, however, easily suppressed without actual bloodshed. Dinuzulu, son of Cetshwayo, together with other chiefs and ringleaders, was arrested, and tried on charges of high treason, rebellion, sedition, murder, etc., and found guilty, though complicity in the murders of several noted loyalist Chiefs was not proved as against Dinuzulu. Dinuzulu was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, whilst other Chiefs were sentenced for longer periods and transported to St. Helena. It was generally believed that prompt action was the means of arresting what might have been a very serious conflagration.

**Constitution.**

Natal, which had been annexed to Cape Colony in 1843, was placed under separate government in 1845, and under charter of July 15, 1856, was erected into a separate Colony. By this charter partially representative institutions were established, and, under a Natal Act of 1893, assented to by Order in Council June 26, 1893, the Colony obtained responsible government. The province of Zululand was annexed to Natal on December 30th, 1897. The districts of Vryheid, Utrecht and part of Wakkerstroom, formerly belonging to the Transvaal, were in January, 1903, annexed to the colony. On May 31, 1910, the Colony was merged in the Union of South Africa, becoming an original province of the Union.

**Instruction.**

With the exception of Higher Education, which has been placed under the control of the Union Government, Education comes under the Provincial Administration. There are 8 Government secondary and intermediate schools, 2 Government preparatory schools, 137 Government primary schools, 1 Government art school, 1 agricultural and trades' school, 6 Government Indian schools, 6 Government schools for coloured children, besides Government-aided schools, and 161 Government-aided farmhouse schools for European children. Also there are 2 technical institutes, 38 Indian schools, 377 Native schools, and 13 coloured schools, all of which receive Government aid; and 36 private schools in the province. Seven of the aided schools are secondary schools for girls. The aggregate number of European pupils in regular attendance at the Government and inspected schools was 26,963 for 1919; the average daily attendance 87 per cent. of the number on the registers. At the Government high and preparatory schools there is an average daily attendance of 2,830 pupils. Considerable numbers of children attend private unaided schools, and it is estimated that only a very small percentage of white children are receiving no education. Primary education is now free in Government European and coloured schools. The direct (government expenditure on Government schools for 1919 was £24,641. Fees paid by pupils in Government schools for 1919 amounted to £7,974. The 337 Government-aided schools for natives had a total enrolment of 27,463, and received in
1919 grants in aid to the amount of 29,253l.; and the 38 Government-aided schools for the children of Indians had a total enrolment of 6,783 in 1919, for which a grant of 8,045l. was expended.

Finance.

Since the coming into effect of the Union there is only one financial statement for the four provinces together. Particulars are given above under the Union. Since the passing of the Financial Relations Act, No. 10, 1913, the provincial revenue is made up of an amount voted by Parliament by way of subsidy and certain revenue transferred or assigned.

* Preliminary unaudited figures.

In 1920 there were registered 4,996 births, 1,796 deaths and 1,812 marriages of Europeans.

The capital, Bloemfontein, had in 1911, 14,720 white inhabitants (8,996 males and 5,725 females), and 12,205 natives and other coloured (6,212 males and 5,993 females); total, 26,925; and in 1921, 19,333 white inhabitants and 19,532 coloured; total 38,865.

PROVINCE OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Province of the Orange Free State lies to the north of the Orange River and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and the Province of Natal. The country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts.
Religion.—The principal body, according to the census of 1911, is the Dutch Reformed Church with 175,311 adherents; of Wesleyans there were 88,857; Anglican Communion 42,401; Presbyterians 7,549; Congregationalists 8,368; Lutherans 8,727; Roman Catholics 5,696; Jews 2,503; No religion (so stated) 173,336, of whom 173,192 were natives and other coloured persons.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Moshesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the rush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieutenant-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the establishment of Responsible Government, July, 1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown Colony Government was established and continued till 30th June, 1907, when Responsible Government was granted. The election of the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907.

The Legislature consisted of two Chambers—a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly, consisting of 11 and 39 members respectively.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Orange River Colony became, under the name of the Orange Free State, a Province of the Union of South Africa, and is now governed in terms of the South Africa Act which constituted the Union of South Africa. Apart from the general control of the Union Parliament the Act provided that the control of certain specified matters should be vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Education.

Higher education is under the control of the Minister of Education for the Union, while primary (including elementary) and secondary education is controlled by the Administrator of the Province. Under the Educational Ordinance No.9, of 1920, the Province is divided into a number of School Districts. Each Government School is under the supervision of a School Committee elected by the parents. For each District there is also a School Board, appointed partly by the School Committees and partly by the Government, which exercises general supervision over all schools within its district. The School Committees have the right of nominating teachers, subject to the approval of the Department. Grants are given conditionally to private schools. At present there are about 861 Government and Government-aided European schools in the Province with a total enrolment of 42,879 to Dec. 31st, 1920. Education is free but fees may be charged under certain circumstances, and attendance is compulsory up to Standard VI. Except where the parent objects, both official languages are taught to all children and where possible are used as equal media of instruction.

Bloemfontein is the chief educational centre, and contains the following institutions:

(a) Primary and Secondary Education.—Grey College School, a boys' high school, with 325 pupils; the Eunice High School for Girls, with 538 pupils; the Brehmer School, a mixed primary school, with 788 pupils; a Model School in connection with the Normal College, and two infant schools. These six are Government schools, Grey College School and the Eunice High School having large boarding departments. The "Orange," St. Michael's Home and St. Andrew's Schools are
Government-aided schools, whilst the Convent School is a private school. All these have large boarding establishments.

(b) Training of Teachers.—The Normal School, established soon after the war, has been replaced by the Normal College, where about 180 students take out the Third Year of the Training Course prescribed by the Education Ordinance of 1920, a limited number receiving a more advanced training. The first three years of the Course are taken out at the various secondary schools throughout the country, the total number of students being about 200.

The Polytechnic College, established in 1912, trains teachers in Art and Technical subjects (music, painting, art needlework, dressmaking, cookery, etc.). The classes are also open for general students.

(c) Industrial Education.—The Home Industries Board directs various spinning and weaving schools throughout the country. The Government Industrial School for boys was opened in 1907. The numbers are 80, all resident and apprenticed to various trades. Saddle and harness-making, carpentry, smithwork, etc., are taught in the institution itself, while engineering, printing, painting, etc., are taught in various local workshops. Artisans schools have also been established at Ficksburg, Jacobsdal, Ladybrand, Heilbron, Kopjes and Goldemoed, the total number of pupils being about 200.

At Bethlehem there is a residential technical school for girls, giving instruction in housewifery, dressmaking, millinery, horticulture and commercial work. Agricultural Schools have been established at Ladybrand and Tweespruit, the latter providing a three years' practical and theoretical course for both boys and girls in farm and dairy work.

Secondary schools have been established in all the leading towns of the Province with more advanced departments, preparing pupils up to University Matriculation Standard.

The gross expenditure on education of white and coloured scholars for the financial year 1920-21 was £30,000. This sum does not include the cost of construction of educational buildings.

TRANSAAL PROVINCE.

Situation Area and Population.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange Free State Province and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal Province at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22° S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea.

The area of the Province is 110,450 square miles, divided into 26 districts. The census of May 7, 1911, showed for the Transvaal a population amounting to 1,686,212, of whom 971,555 were males, and 714,657 females. The population comprised 420,562 Europeans or whites (compared with 499,347 in 1918), 1,219,846 natives and 45,805 other coloured races. In 1921 the population (preliminary unaudited figures) was as follows:—Europeans, 544,486 (284,958 males, 259,528 females); Coloured, 1,541,351 (873,348 males, 668,003 females); total, 2,086,837 (1,188,306 males, 927,531 females). In 1920 there were 16,768 births, 6,040 deaths and 5,432 marriages of Europeans.

The white population of Pretoria in 1911 was 35,942, in 1918, 41,690, and in 1921, 45,183. The largest town is Johannesburg, the mining centre of Witwatersrand goldfields, with a population (1911) of 237,104 consisting of 119,953 whites and 117,151 coloured. In 1918, the white population of Johannesburg was 137,166. In 1921 the population was 284,191 of whom 148,678 were whites and 134,513 coloured persons.

History.

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1858, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagos Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000l. in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,900l. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetshwayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuana chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerrilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of its people. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided refusal.

In December, 1880, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were immediately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender.

The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Pietermaritzburg in Natal to relieve them. A large force of Boers opposed his entry into the Transvaal at Laing's Nek, the path across the Drakensberg mountains.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr.
Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs; that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuanaland tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen. Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial
difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to £77,877., had risen in 1890 to £229,061., reaching £3,329,958. in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1895, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his intervention Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years'
offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

After some correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissence from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveley after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enalin, and on the 26th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronje was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.

The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post.
of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1903, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieut-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less
than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

On 6th December, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The legislature consisted of two chambers, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the former containing fifteen members and the latter sixty-nine.

The Transvaal was included as an original Province of the Union of South Africa in terms of the South Africa Act, 1909, which came into operation on the 31st May, 1910, and is now governed under that Act. Apart from the general control of the Parliament of the Union, the control of certain matters specified in the South Africa Act is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Municipal Government.

Municipal Government was established in the principal towns of the Province by Ordinances enacted in 1903. These Ordinances were extended and amended during the years 1904-1909 inclusive, and were during the 1912 session of the Provincial Council consolidated and further amended so as to give local authorities more extensive powers, principally in regard to matters affecting the public health, although other important amendments, e.g., the basis of the municipal franchise, and the principle of councillors contracting with Councils, were incorporated in the consolidating and amending Ordinances. Three Ordinances were enacted dealing with:

(a) the constitution of Local Authorities, i.e., Town and Village Councils and Health Committees, and the powers and duties of such bodies;
(b) the election of councillors, and
(c) the levying of assessment rates.

Under these Ordinances, as under previous legislation, the Provincial Administration retains some measures of control over the government of Municipalities, limited, however, to powers of audit and surcharge, the approval of loan proposals, local improvement schemes and the alienation of Municipal property. There are now 47 Municipalities (22 Town Councils and 25 Village Councils) in the Province and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made since the inauguration of local self-government.

In areas under the jurisdiction of Town Councils the Municipal franchise under the Ordinance is extended to all white persons, males or females of the age of 21 years and upwards being British subjects who have resided within the Municipality for a period of three months immediately preceding the compilation of the voters' roll, or who is the owner of rateable property in the municipality.

Any person, male or female, qualified to be registered as a voter is eligible to be elected a Councillor.

In areas under the jurisdiction of Village Councils the qualification of voters and Councillors is the same as that for Town Councils. There are 25 such bodies in the province.

In all municipal areas elections are by ballot, a more simple form of procedure being followed in the case of Village Councils than with Town Councils.

Legislation enacted in 1905 and 1906 provided for the creation of Health Committees where the density of population made it necessary in semi-urban areas for sanitary measures to be enforced. Twenty-five of these committees have been established. Provision is now made in the Local Government Ordinance of 1912 for the constitution of such bodies and wider powers of control are delegated to them under that Ordinance. There are 25 Health Committees in the Province.

A Commission, styled the Local Government Commission, is now sitting for the purpose of considering problems connected with Municipal Government, and it is not unlikely that as a result of its deliberations, fundamental changes in the existing law will be made.

SOUTH WEST AFRICA.

This country is bounded on the North by Portuguese West Africa, on the West by the Atlantic Ocean, on the South and Southern portion of the Eastern boundary by the Cape Province of the Union, and on the remainder of the Eastern boundary by the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Attached to it is the so-called Caprivi Zipfel, a narrow strip extending from the Northern corner of the Eastern boundary on East Long. 21° to the Zambesi River, which it meets at a point close to the 25th degree. This strip is bounded on the North by Portuguese West Africa and Northern Rhodesia, and on the South by the Bechuanaland Protectorate.

Early in the late war the country was invaded by the Military Forces of the Union, and on the 9th July, 1915, was surrendered to them at Khorab. It is now administered by the Union under a Mandate from the League of Nations dated 17th December, 1920.

The laws of the Union, subject to local modifications, if required, may be applied to the country, and are gradually being introduced.

In terms of the Mandate, military training of the natives, except for police or defence purposes, is forbidden, and no naval or military fortifications may be established.

The supply of intoxicating liquor to the natives is prohibited, as also is any system of forced labour.

On the Western coast, a strip, varying from 60 to 100 miles in width, and extending from the Orange river in the South to the Ugab river, which borders on what is known as the Kaokoveld, consists of barren desert, as is also the case in that portion of the Great Kalahari depression which is included in the country on its eastern boundary.

The Kukene river and the Okavango, which form portions of the Northern border of the country, and the Orange river in the South, are the only permanently running streams, but there is a system of great sandy dry river beds, in which water can generally be obtained by sinking shallow wells throughout the country, consisting of the Keisib, Swakop, Omaruru and Ugab on the West, the Fish river in the South, the Nosob and the Elephant rivers in the South-East, and a series of what are known as Omiramba in the North-West, with numerous smaller stream beds. During the summer rainy season these nearly all become running streams.

In the Grootfontein area, which geologists describe as a "karst" region, there are large supplies of underground water, but except for a few springs, mostly hot, there is no surface water throughout the country. Much, however, has been done to improve matters by boring, which has almost always been successful if the site for the borehole is well chosen.

The total area of the country is about 322,400 square miles.

The European population, according to the figures of the 1921 census, amounts to 19,237. The native population is calculated at about 218,000. As large areas of the country, particularly along the coast and in the North are uncivilised, it has been impossible to procure precise figures. In particular it has been difficult to estimate the numbers of the Bushmen, who still exist in considerable tribes in the North-Eastern portion of the country.

It is estimated that of the 19,000 European inhabitants between 7 and 8 thousand are Germans. The remainder are almost all South Africans, and farmers by profession.

Thirty British schools have been established with 1,250 pupils.

The administration of the country is conducted from central offices situated at Windhoek, and the country is divided into 17 districts, controlled by magistrates. In addition there is a Native Commissioner in Ovamboland in the extreme North, who keeps in touch with the new races of Ovambos living there, and recruits natives for the railway system and for the working of the diamond fields at Luderitz. There is also a sub-native Commissioner stationed at Kurung Kuru, on the Okavange river, with similar duties.

The principal native races of South-West Africa are the Ovambos, Hereros, Bergdamaras or Klippafirs, Hottentots and Bushmen.
The Ovambos are a Bantu race, and follow agriculture as a pursuit. They still possess its full extent tribal organisation, and are fairly well armed, but have given no trouble since the British occupation of the country. The Germans in pre-war times exercised no authority whatever over them, and never entered their territory.

The Hereros are a pastoral people who formerly owned enormous herds of cattle. The Germans in dealing with these people pursued a policy of oppression, with the result that in 1904 they rebelled, and 75 per cent. of them were destroyed. Their tribal organisation has completely disappeared, and they are now scattered throughout the country on farms and in different towns, where they form the ordinary source of labour.

Owing to the fact that formerly tribal organisation was based on the ownership of cattle, and that they have consequently for generations been familiar with cattle and their ways, the Herero makes an excellent herd. It is not an unusual thing for a member of this race to have charge of, say, 3,000 head, and to know each one individually.

Since the British occupation of the country the Hereros have considerably increased in numbers and in animal wealth.

The Bergdamaras are, it is believed, also of Bantu origin, though some authorities hold that they belong rather to the Hottentot race, whose language they now speak. They are an inferior tribe, and were alternatively the slaves of the Hereros and the Hottentots in pre-European days, as the former or the latter prevailed in the constant struggles that were going on between them.

The Hottentots, so called, consist of two distinct sections, one of which, whose remnants are found in the central portions of the country, is of pure native extraction, the source of which is but little understood, while the other is composed of tribes which have resulted from an admixture of European blood in the Cape with the Hottentot races residing there a couple of centuries ago, and which after conflict with their European neighbours sought refuge across the Orange river in this country.

The Bushmen are the oldest inhabitants of South West Africa, and are to be found in considerable numbers in its eastern portion from Lat. 26° right away to the Northern boundary. There are also remnants of a bushmen tribe in the desert wastes just north of the Orange River and in the Kaokoveld, in the North North-Western portion of the country. These may be of the "Strandlooper" type.

Situated in the centre of the country just South of the Windhoek District is the Bastard Gebiet, occupied by a semi-independent race known as the Bastards, whose origin is much the same as the second class of Hottentots mentioned above, with the difference that the admixture of European blood is much greater, and that their ordinary language is Cape Dutch. These people control their own affairs to a very large extent, and are governed by a Raad (Council) which is partly hereditary and partly elected. The Administration is represented by a magistrate, who assists them with advice, and takes cognisance of serious crimes. They number about 5,000.

Windhoek, the capital, is pleasantly situated at an altitude of 5,600 ft., in the centre of the Territory. The town, with its surrounding district, contains a population of over 4,000 Europeans and 13,000 Natives.

Previous to 1920 German Imperial and Local Laws were in force in the country, plus, during military occupation, Martial Law. On the 31st December, 1920, the latter was abolished, and the Roman Dutch Law became the Common Law of the country. Civil Courts have been established, the whole of the troops have been withdrawn, and the Government is now conducted on a purely civil basis. Its administration has been vested by the Union Parliament in the Governor-General of the Union, but the latter has under due authority delegated his powers to an Administrator, with full authority to legislate. In this respect he now has the benefit of the assistance of an Advisory Council consisting of six members, and at present composed of three Germans, two Dutchmen and one official, the latter representing the interests of the Natives.

The present Administrator is Mr. Gijsbert Reitz Hofmeyr, C.M.G., who was for many years Clerk of the Union House of Assembly, and succeeded Sir Howard Gorges, K.C.M.G., M.V.O., in October, 1920.

The chief executive officer for the country is the Secretary for South-West Africa, Mr. J. F. Herbst, C.B.E.

Finance.

For the financial year 1920-21 the revenue amounted to £1,601,216, and the expenditure to £929,386. The corresponding figures for the preceding year were £654,370 and £718,100. The estimates for the year 1921-22 are Revenue £806,800, and Expenditure £894,644.

The principal course of revenue is the tax on diamonds, which is 66 per cent. of the gross proceeds, less 70 per cent. of the working costs. Owing to the extensive depression in the diamond market at present, revenue is expected to fall off considerably.

Customs.

The revenue from this source is a round sum of £75,000, paid over by the Union Customs Department, which has entire control of Customs matters in South West Africa. This figure is an estimate of the sum which would accrue to the country if it levied its own Customs dues at Union rates.

Trade.

Any figures which can be supplied in this respect cannot be accepted as a sound basis for deductions, in view of the changed conditions owing to the occupation of the country by the Union, and the subsequent construction of a railway line joining the railway system of the two countries together.

The pre-war figures were as follows:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1911 | 2,265,097 | 1,734,558 |
| 1912 | 1,624,944 | 1,952,667 |
| 1913 | 2,171,230 | 3,446,220 |

After the war the following are the figures:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1919 | 1,135,116 | 1,679,534 |
| Six months ended 30th June, 1920 | 1,014,347 | 2,448,321 |
| Six months ended 30th June, 1921 | 656,297 | 1,055,855 |
The big decrease in the exports is due to the falling off of the diamond production.

Mineral Production.

The staple industry is diamonds, which are found along the coast from the Orange river to Conception Bay. The fields are alluvial and the deposits shallow. The stones are small, but of a very good quality. In 1920 the yield was 606,423,690 carats, valued at £3,000,000. Other minerals worked are copper, rich deposits of which exist at Tsumeb, and in the neighbourhood scheelite, wolfram, vanadium, marble and tin. Gold and silver are known to exist, but in such small quantities as not to be payable. The discovery of coal will be an immense benefit to the country, and an occurrence is being investigated, but it is impossible to say whether it is of value or not.

Agriculture.

South-West Africa is essentially a stock raising country, the absence of water and the scarcity of suitable soil rendering agriculture, except on a very small scale, almost impossible, and in fact, except as regards maize, the requirements of the country in this direction cannot be met from local sources. Even vegetables must be imported in considerable quantities from the Union.

So far as stock is concerned the country, with the exception of the desert strips, is excellent, and even portions of the latter are valuable at certain times of the year.

Generally speaking, the Southern half of the Territory is suited for the raising of small stock, while the central and northern portions are better fitted for cattle.

As already mentioned, the Hereros in earlier days possessed immense herds of cattle, and the Ovambos in the North also own numbers.

It is estimated that in 1921 there were 350,000 head of cattle, and 2,000,000 head of small stock within the borders of South-West Africa.

A Land Board has been established, and Government ground is being rapidly allotted to suitable applicants on 5 years' leases, with the option of purchase on very easy terms as to instalments. Personal occupation is essential.

As in almost all cases boring is necessary in order to provide a sufficient supply of water the proceedings of this Board are naturally slow.

A strong Irrigation Section has been established, which now has in its possession some 50 drills, and will shortly receive still more. It is found that each drill can on the average provide four satisfactory bore-holes in 12 months, and it will be seen therefore that only a few farms can be given out each year. They vary in size from 3,000 hectares in the North to 20,000 in the South.

Applications, which come mainly from the Union, are far in excess of the existing provision.

Harbours.

In pre-war times the Germans used Luderitz and Swakopmund as their two harbours. Although the Cape Government made them offers on liberal lines to enable them to land goods at Walvis Bay these were always refused.

At the outbreak of war Union troops were landed at Walvis Bay, and in a very short time a railway was built from that port to join up with the existing line from Swakopmund to the interior, and nowadays the bulk of the imports into the country are landed at Walvis Bay, which, although strictly part of the Union, is administered as far as possible as if it formed a portion of South West Africa.

Swakopmund, which possesses a climate equal to that of any watering place in South Africa, although it lies within the tropics, is now developing as a seaside resort, and is very popular with the European inhabitants of the country during the summer months. It is altogether useless as a port.

The Government proposes to develop Walvis Bay as the main harbour for the service of the country. Its situation is central, and its natural advantages are so great that the proposition is bound to be successful almost automatically. The Bay itself is about 7 miles wide, and of the same length, and is completely sheltered by Pelican Point from the prevailing south-west winds, and in fact from every other direction except North North-West, from which gales are almost unknown.

The Bay is now being surveyed with a view to arriving at a decision as to where is the most suitable spot for the construction of the harbour works.

Railways.

For the purposes of the campaign in this country the railway line which already existed in the Union between De Aar Junction and Prieska was extended through Upington across the Orange river, and eventually joined up with the existing line from Kalkfontein South to Windhoek. The latter line was of the same gauge as the Cape railways, but from Windhoek through Karibib and Usakos to Swakopmund on the coast, and Grootfontein and Tsumeb in the North-West, the pre-war railway was of 2 ft. gauge. For military purposes the Union Forces converted the section between Swakopmund and Windhoek to the Cape gauge, and connected it with Walvis Bay, but the railway in the North remains of 2 ft. gauge.

The whole of the railway system from De Aar in the Union to the border and within the border is controlled by the Director of Railways, who has his seat in Windhoek.

Comfortable mail trains, with dining cars attached, and ample sleeping accommodation, run twice a week each way, and maintain communication with the Union.

The journey from Cape Town or Pretoria to Windhoek occupies three days and four nights. Arrangements are shortly to be made by which it will be reduced by one night.

The total length of the line inside South-West Africa is 967 miles of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, and 98 of 2 ft. There are also 98 miles of private line, most of which has been constructed for the service of the diamond fields south of Luderitz.

There are excellent telephone and telegraph systems in existence, Windhoek being in communication by the former with places as far distant as Outjo in the North, Gobabis in the East, Swakopmund in the West, and Keetmanshoop in the South.

There are two trunk telegraph lines to the Union. In addition there is the great wireless station at Windhoek, which the Germans built for military purposes, and which was able occasionally to communicate direct with Berlin. This has been maintained in good order since the occupation, but the main instruments cannot be worked owing to the removal by the Germans of a few essential parts. It is now under consideration to re-constitute this station as a link in the proposed chain of Imperial Wireless Stations.
HIGH COMMISSION.

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa was created by Letters Patent in 1878. In 1879 a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who was also Governor of Natal (which now includes Zululand and Amatongaland). The High Commissioner for South Africa, who, under the Commission of 1889, was the officer for the time being administering the Government of the Cape, represents the Crown in all matters occurring in South Africa beyond the limits of the Colonies properly so called. He was, till 1889, charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native states and tribes outside the Colonies of the Cape land Natal, including Swaziland, which was administered by the Government of the South African Republic under the Convention of 1894.

The High Commissioner is Governor of Basutoland, supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland, and exercises the control provided by Order in Council over the Administration of the British South Africa Company in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898, and the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1911, provide respectively for a control by the High Commissioner over legislation, important appointments, and Native affairs in Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, who is paid from Imperial funds and acts as the local representative of the High Commissioner and the Imperial Government. The office of High Commissioner, which was formerly held by the Governor of Cape Colony, was, by a Commission dated Oct. 6th, 1900, vested in Lord Milner, by a similar Commission, dated March 15th, 1905, in Lord Selborne. Since 1910, the office has been vested, by separate Commission, in the successive holders of the office of Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.
