HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of Islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area about 32 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Lyceum Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (24 square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1860 with the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutter's Green, Apiechow, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwang-tung, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be leased for 99 years; a stipulation was included that within the walled city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials then stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon City, which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order in Council, was incorporated in the leased territory and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland and Islands leased is about 369 square miles. A careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. This New Territory is divided into two main districts—the Northern and the Southern—and is in charge of two District Officers, who perform the duties of land officers and magistrates, and are authorised to
hold small debts courts. The District Officer of the Northern district has his headquarters at Tai Po on an arm of Mirs Bay; the headquarters of the Southern district are in Victoria.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'oeil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees. Some large and handsome buildings stand on the Praya West Reclamation, which was completed in 1903. The reclamation of a large area (2,249,000 sq. ft.) in front of the Praya East, has been authorised. Work has already begun, and it is expected that the whole reclamation will be completed within six years.

The rainfall for 1919 was 76·14 inches; and for 1920, 107·88 inches. In 1919 the mean temperature was 72·2° and in 1920, 72·0°; the mean minimum temperature during the latter year ranging from 79·1° in July to 54·3° in January and the mean maximum temperature from 87·0° in July to 62·4° in February. Typhoons are prevalent during the months July to October.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1913 being 309,680 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 142,759; immigrants, 166,921, excluding to and from China ports.

Industry.

The position of the island has made it a distributing centre for trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal commodities handled are coal, cotton, and cotton goods, hides, iron and steel, matches, nuts, oils, rice, sugar, silk, sandalwood, tea, tin, wolframite, etc.

Ship-building is a large and growing industry, and there are also factories of very considerable importance engaged in the manufacture of cigars and cigarettes, rope, cement, and the refining of sugar.

Native industries such as the manufacture of vermilion, sauces, bamboo ware, building of native craft, etc., are of large and increasing dimensions.

The natural products of Hong Kong are few and unimportant. There is little land suitable for tillage, and nothing is grown but a little rice and some vegetables near the outlying villages. There are large granite quarries, both on the island and in Kowloon. A bed of fire clay exists at Deep Water Bay, and bricks and earthenware pipes are manufactured from it. A dairy farm supplies fresh meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. The fishing in the waters of the Colony is good and is a source of livelihood to a vast number of Chinese.

The new Territories have extensive cultivable land, on which are grown sugar, rice, vegetables, lychees, pineapples, etc. The cultivation is entirely in the hands of the Chinese villagers and it is doubtful whether European enterprise would be successful. A very rich deposit of iron has been found in the hills, and promises to be very remunerative. A summary of the trade for 1919 is given below:

Shipping.

Hong Kong is a free port except as regards importation of intoxicating liquors and tobacco, and no details of the trade of previous years are available, but the control of trade rendered necessary by the war has given an opportunity of collecting some statistics. Figures of a tentative kind were available for a part of 1917 and full trade returns have been published annually from the year 1918 onwards. The enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected may be estimated from the amount of shipping which has steadily grown, with one or two slight fluctuations, for over twenty years.

The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1920 amounted to 40,129,597 tons, an increase of 4,507,358 tons compared with 1919. There were 21,631 arrivals of 12,123,706 tons, and 21,733 departures of 12,070,308 tons.

Of British ocean-going tonnage 4,184,927 tons entered, and 4,166,197 tons cleared.

Of British river steamers 1,628,878 tons entered, and 1,628,107 tons cleared.

Of foreign ocean-going tonnage 4,616,693 tons entered, and 4,606,869 tons cleared.

Of foreign river steamers 289,186 tons entered, and 288,084 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons trading to ports outside the colony, 83,276 tons entered, and 83,972 tons cleared.

Of junks in foreign trade 1,320,745 tons entered, and 1,297,129 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons plying within the waters of the Colony 7,318,424 tons entered and 7,318,424 tons cleared.

Of junks in local trade 223,101 tons entered, and 223,134 tons cleared.

Thus in Foreign Trade:

Docks.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company, who were aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under the Colonial Docks Act, have three dry docks and two slips at their Kowloon establishment, one dry dock at Mong Kok Tsui, on the western side of the Kowloon Peninsula, and two at Aberdeen, on the south side of the island of Hong Kong. The Admiralty have built a large dock in the Naval establishment in the middle of the City of Victoria, and Messrs. Butterfield & Swire a still larger one at Quarry Bay, just inside the Lyceum Park.

Besides these there are several building slips and repairing shops owned by Europeans and Chinese in various parts of the Colony.

Currency and Banking.

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1895):

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half-dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
4. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
5. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint £2,108,064 dollars and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of £402,671. There were obtained from England, and there were in circulation on 31st Dec., 1920, subsidiary coins (which now include half dollars) to the nominal value of £20,764,370.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now.

The principal Banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Ltd., the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Mercantile Bank of India, the International Banking Corporation, the Russo-Asiatic Bank, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Bank of Taiwan, the Netherlands-India Commercial Bank, the Netherlands Trading Society, the Banque de l'Indo-Chine, the Crédit-Foncier d'Extrême Orient, Banque Industriale de Chine. The first named bank conducts a Savings Bank. There are also a large number of Chinese banks.

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Mercantile Bank of India are authorised to issue notes in the Colony, the total circulation amounting to £37,459,452 at the close of 1920.
Local weights and measures are the following:

1 tael = 1½ oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoirdupois);
7½ catties = 1 imperial gallon; 1,000 Chinese cash = 1 dollar.

Means of Communication.

Hong Kong is extremely well situated as regards telegraphic communication, in all directions, with all parts of the world. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company (British) by means of two cables to Singapore, via Labuan and Cape St. James respectively, provide good connections with Europe, via India, with Australasia and with the other British Colonies and possessions. By their cable to Manilla connection is made with the direct American cable, thence to San Francisco. Two cables to Shanghai, belonging respectively to the Eastern Extension and to the Great Northern (Danish) Companies, via Foochow and Amoy respectively, give a good connection with Shanghai (North China), Japan and Russia; and the system of the Great Northern Telegraph Company gives a good service to Europe, via Asiatic Russia.

A radio-telegraph station established at Cape d'Aguilar provides communication with vessels.

Hong Kong possesses unrivalled steam communication. The P. & O. S. N. Co., M. M. Cie, & Holtz Line maintain a regular service with the United Kingdom and Europe. The P.M., S.S. Co., T. K. K., Admiral Line, O. S. K., N. Y. K., and J. C. J. Line maintain a regular service between Hong Kong and the United States of America. The Canadian Pacific S.S. Limited maintain a regular service with Vancouver, B.C.

The E. & A., N. Y. K., and China Navigation Co. keep up a frequent, but irregular service to Australian ports. In addition to these several large lines of steamers, there are also other lines which frequent Hong Kong from various parts, such as the Robert Dollar Co., Shire, Glen and Rank lines, and Lloyd Trestino, and at a near date the City Line are to have a regular line of passenger steamers in addition to their present irregular service of freighters.

Regular steam communication between Java and Hong Kong has been established by the Indo-China S. N. Co.'s and the Java-China-Japan Line. Between the ports on the east coast of China, Formosa and Hong Kong the steamers of the Douglas S. S. Co. ply regularly twice a week, and those of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha weekly, and there is constant steam communication with Hoihow, Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Touane, Bangkok, Borneo, etc. With Shanghai, Tientsin, and the ports of Japan there is frequent communication by steamers of the Indo-China S. N. Co., China Navigation, and other lines, in addition to the English, French and American mail steamers, which leave weekly. With Calcutta there are services by the Indo-China S. N. Co. and the Apcar Line, about once a fortnight by each line. Between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton there is a daily steam service, and tri-weekly steamers as far as Wuchow on the West River.

A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels. An electric tramway from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. The island possesses roads available for vehicular traffic both in the town and outside from which unrivalled views can be obtained, especially from the wind-swept roads in the hill districts. There is also a fine motor road round the island.

There are excellent motor roads in Kowloon and the New Territory—the road to Fanling via Castle Peak and back via Taipo being a panorama of views over a route of about 58 miles.

The usual means of transport is by motor, ricksha, chair or boat. A railway was completed in the year 1910 from Kowloon to the Chinese frontier, where it joins the line from Canton. Telephonic communication is available to all parts of the Colony.

Direct Money Orders are exchanged with the United Kingdom, China, Canada, United States of America, Union of South Africa, India, Ceylon, the Australian Commonwealth, the Dominion of New Zealand, Straits Settlements, Federated Malay States, State of North Borneo, Sarawak, Siam, Macao, Japan, French Indo-China and the Philippine Islands. British Postal Orders are issued and paid in Hong Kong. Telegraphic Money Orders are exchanged with the United Kingdom only.

Education.

Formerly Government control over education was confined to the Government and grant schools, of which details are given below; but in 1913 an Ordinance was passed, the effect of which has been to bring more than 500 private schools under Government supervision.

The number of Government schools and schools which receive grants from Government is 64, of which 10 are English schools, i.e. schools in which the English language is the medium of instruction, and 54 are vernacular schools. There are four schools which are reserved for children of European-British parentage.

The total number of pupils in average attendance at Government and grant schools was 8,668 in 1920. Of these 2,929 were in Government, and 5,739 in grant schools.

A technical institute supplies instruction in commercial and technical subjects. The total enrolment in 1920 was 588.

The University of Hong Kong has an enrolment of over 200 students. There are at present three faculties, of medicine, engineering and arts. The standard aimed at is that of the University of London.

Revenue.

About one-fourth of the revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly and one-eighth from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes: 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria, the Hill District, Kowloon Point, Yaumati and Hung Hom; and rates varying from 7 to 12½ per cent. in the outlying villages.
The annual rates payable on the valuation for 1919-20 are $2,091,163 an increase of $85,535 on the previous valuation. The remainder is derived from licences, land revenue, stamps, duties, and fees. The duties on intoxicating liquors are expected to realize $730,000 in 1920, Duties on Tobacco (imposed July, 1916), $600,000, Land Sales to reach $200,000, Stamp Revenue to reach $1,100,000, and Postal Revenue $440,000. The total Revenue for 1920 is estimated at $15,314,800.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19th January, 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and three unofficial members, besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of seven official and six unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (two being usually Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members vacate their seats after six years from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1912 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
