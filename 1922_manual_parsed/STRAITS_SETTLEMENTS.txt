STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, comprising Singa-
pore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from
the control of the Indian Government to that of
the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st
April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under
the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament
(29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest
length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing
an area of 217 square miles, situated at the
southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from
which it is separated by a narrow strait about
three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a
number of small islands adjacent to it which form
part of the settlement, which now comprises also
Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singa-
pore, at the southern point of the island, in lat.
1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9
broad, containing an area of 108 square miles,
situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula
in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or
entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the oppo-
site shore of the mainland, from which the island
is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad,
is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming
part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width,
and extending 45 miles along the coast, including
10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide
infra), the whole containing an area of 280 square
miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north
lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the
peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about
110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter,
and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in
length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, con-
taining an area of 720 square miles. The town,
called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14'
east long.

The Dindings, area about 183 square miles,
include the island of Pangkor and a strip of
territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles
from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east
long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland,
possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and
arrangements have been made for coasting
steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were
declared a British possession in 1857, were placed,
by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under
the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by
Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886,
under the Governor of the Straits Settlements.
In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits
Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement
of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50'
to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of
Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There
are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and
nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-
Australia cable route was established on Direction
Island, in the north-eastern part of the group.
The population numbers about 795.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean,
190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long.
105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and
placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 4th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 62 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number about 1,100, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employés of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17th March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 280 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end in 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca, under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 11 official members and 8 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Climate.

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1920 was 83° F.; in Penang, 82° 7° F.; in Province Wellesley, 84° F.; and in Malacca, 81° F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 88° 7° and 74° 6° F. There are no well-marked rainy
and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1911 to 1920, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 171 wet days; the average monthly rainfall for the same period being 212 millimetres. In 1920 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 2,362 millimetres; in Penang 2,532 millimetres; in Province Wellesley 2,318 millimetres; in Malacca 1,823 millimetres; and in the Dinding 1,665 millimetres. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoons blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have south-east, south or south-west winds for portions of the days as early as March or April.

The population as ascertained at the 1921 census was:

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe weekly by British India steamers, via Negapatam and Bombay, and fortnightly services by the Peninsular and Oriental and Messageries Maritimes vessels, via Ceylon; in addition there is a fortnightly service by the Steamship Co. “Nederland”; and at frequent intervals by the Holt’s, Chargeurs-Réunis, Glen, Shire, Japanese and other lines; with China and Japan twice a fortnight by the P. and O. and M.M. lines, and by other lines frequently; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong and by Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok by Straits steamship and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India Ports by Netherlands India Cos.’ steamers; with Australian ports frequently by British India, Burns Philp, Ocean Steamship Co., Western Australia Steam Navigation Co., and other lines direct, and occasionally via Colombo, with the sailings thence of Orient Packets; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, weekly by the British India Cos.’ steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Co., British India, Apcar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang.
Letters from England reach Singapore in from 27 to 30 days. Services have not yet become normal.

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1920 to $7,972,307, the principal business done being with India, Federated Malay States, Ceylon, United Kingdom, Netherlands East India and United States of America.

Ten sub-marine cables radiate from Singapore: 1 direct to Madras; 4 to Penang, thence to Madras (2), Colombo (1), Deli (1); 1 to Batavia, thence to Cocos (1); 1 to Banjoewangie, thence to Darwin (2); 1 direct to Hong Kong; 1 to Cochin-China, thence to Hong Kong(1), and 1 to Labuan, thence to Hong Kong (1). There are also Government telegraph lines from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Pérak, Selângor, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Siam, Johore, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur (503 miles) was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 790 miles of telegraph line, 36 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley and 2 miles between Singapore and Johore and there are 21,081 miles of telephone line. The telephone exchange in Singapore is worked by the Oriental Telephone Co. and the exchanges in Penang, Province Wellesley and Malacca, are worked by the Post Office. A section of the Federated Malay States Railway system connects Singapore and Bangkok, Province Wellesley from South to North with a section from Bukit Martajam to Prai. Another section of the system runs from the docks of Singapore† to Kranji, and a third section connects Malacca with the main line at Tampin, in Negri Sembilan.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided in Government or grant-in-aid schools and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsecular. There is a reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1920 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 10 | 4,243 | 3,983 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 32 | 13,259 | 12,295 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 195 | 12,979 | 11,502 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 10 | 390 | 327 |
| **Total.** | **247** | **39,871** | **28,107** |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners

† The extensive docks owned by the Tanjong Pagar Dock Company were acquired by the Government in 1906, and are now controlled by a Board, composed of members appointed by the Governor under "the Straits Settlements Ports Ordinance."
were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece has been reduced.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to 2¢ and 1¢ respectively. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of denominations 25 cents and ten cents have been issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver. These notes are only legal tender to the extent of 2¢.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, Chinese Commercial Bank, Communication Bank, The Yokohama Specie Bank, The Ho Hong Bank, The Oversea Chinese Bank and The China Southern Bank the Banque Industrielle de Chine, Lee Wah Bank, Bank pour Indic and the Asia Banking Corporation.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1920 was $153,209 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec., 1899—$3,920,000
" 31st August, 1909—$27,569,475
" 31st Dec., 1919—$174,631,973
" 1920—$101,587,186
" 30th Sept., 1921—$84,262,458

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1920, the deposits amounted to $1,761,845.

The native Weights are:

1 kati = 16 tahil = 1 lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 533¾ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipalities at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, administered by Boards of Commissioners, appointed by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1920 was $9,881,382; and the expenditure $12,216,392.

LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 28·6 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, by three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty, by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1869 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1900, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore. On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was constituted a separate settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded great hopes of the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success. In 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited. The mines have been closed since the beginning of 1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty (not at present in use), and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the coaling jetties.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton and H.M. ships with coal, at 2l. 2s. 4d. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and béche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago factories in the island where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office Savings Bank in Labuan, but no other bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins. Straits notes are also available in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other natives from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

There are two schools, viz.:—The Government English School, and the Vernacular School which are maintained by the Government.

A reservoir owned by the Government supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking water.

The Eastern Extension, Australasian and China Telegraph Company has a station on the island connected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong and North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

A weekly service of steamers plying between Singapore, North Borneo Ports and the Philippines provides Labuan with a regular communication with these places; there are, in addition, local coasting steamers. A number of larger seagoing vessels call at the Port for bunker and cargo coal and water.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are supplied by a Navy contractor.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues, land rents and licences.

BRUNEI.

H.H. Sir Mohamed Jemalulalam, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. It is 770 nautical miles distant from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta, of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early
European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 4,000 square miles, containing a population of about 25,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait and Temburong.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000.

Besides the old Malay town which is built over the water on the Brunei River there is a new township on the mainland which has steadily developed since 1910. There are vernacular schools at Brunei and in some of the out-districts. The climate resembles that of the Federated Malay States. The average annual rainfall at Brunei is a little over 100 inches.

Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 600 in the capital. Native industries include fishing, cloth weaving, brass foundries and the manufacture of silversmith's ware. The principal imports are rice, cloth, tobacco, sugar, petroleum and sundries, and the principal exports coal, cutch (mangrove extract), wild and plantation rubber, sago and dried prawns. The trade, to which an impetus was given by the inauguration of the new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber, while oil prospecting is being vigorously developed.

A cutch factory, established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muara (Brooketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882. The output of cutch in 1920 was about 2,093 tons, valued at $355,300. The output of coal in 1920, was 28,107 tons, value $482,400.

The Sultan would derive a considerable income from yearly cession payments made by the State of British North Borneo and Sarawak Governments were they not mortgaged for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amount recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from land and mining rents, from an opium monopoly under Government control, from the collection of customs duties, and from purchased Cession moneys. About half of the original Cession moneys have now been purchased by the Government.

Communications.

There is regular communication with Labuan by steam launch and so with Singapore by the Straits Steamship Company, which maintains a weekly service.

A Central Wireless Telegraph Station was opened in 1921 at Brunei with a subsidiary station at Labuan which enables telegraphic communication to be maintained with Labuan and thence by cable with Singapore and Europe. There is another Wireless Station in the Temburong District.

The Currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.
