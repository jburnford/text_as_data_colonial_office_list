DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba) were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 255,285 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 251,700 square miles.

By Federal Act passed in the Session of 1912, the boundaries of the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba were extended. Ontario was enlarged by 146,400 square miles, Quebec by 354,961 and Manitoba by 178,100.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate now consists of 96 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, 24 to the Maritime Provinces, and 24 to the Western Provinces. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is at the present time (December, 1921) 235; 82 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 16 Nova Scotia, 11 New Brunswick, 15 Manitoba, 13 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 12 Alberta, 16 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that...
Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $4,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $4,000 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council or Cabinet possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. The territory not comprised within any province (the Districts of Yukon, Mackenzie and Franklin) is very thinly inhabited, and is governed by a Commissioner and a Council of four appointed by the Governor in Council at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures. The Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coining, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, as ascertained by the census of 1861, and in the case of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census until the population of each of these two Provinces amounted to 400,000. Each Province also received an annual allowance for Government.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whose public debts were less, proportionally, at the Union than that of the old Province of Canada became entitled to receive an interest allowance, payable half-yearly, on the difference between their respective debts and certain stipulated amounts.

The annual subsidies granted to the several provinces have been revised by Imperial enactment (1907), and are now as follows:

(a) A fixed grant according to population:

| Where population is— | $ |
|---------------------|---|
| Under 150,000       | 100,000 |
| 150,000, but does not exceed 200,000 | 150,000 |
| 200,000             | 180,000 |
| 400,000             | 190,000 |
| 800,000             | 220,000 |
| over 1,500,000      | 240,000 |

(b) A grant at the rate of 80 cents per head of the population of the province up to 2,500,000, and at the rate of 60 cents per head of so much of the population as exceeds that number.

(c) An additional grant of $100,000 yearly to the province of British Columbia for a period of ten years, from 1907.

In lieu of public lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which the Dominion retains, each province receives until its population reaches 400,000, an annual sum of $375,000, payable half-yearly; thereafter until the population reaches 800,000, an annual sum of $562,500; thereafter until the population reaches 1,200,000, $750,000; thereafter the sum payable shall be $1,125,000.

Each of these two provinces, inasmuch as they were not in debt at the time (1905) of their statutory creation, are entitled to be paid half-yearly, in advance, an annual sum of $405,375.

By chapter 32 of the Acts of the Parliament of Canada, 1912, the boundaries of the Province of Manitoba were extended northward to the 60th parallel of north latitude, and eastward to the shores of Hudson Bay, the area of the enlarged province as a result approximating the respective areas of the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In consequence of this enlargement allowances from the Federal Treasury practically identical in amount and upon the same basis as the allowances or grants to Alberta and Saskatchewan, as recited in the preceding paragraphs became payable to the Province of Manitoba.

By chapter 42 of the Acts of 1912, an additional annual grant of one hundred thousand dollars was made to the Province of Prince Edward Island.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland. Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises: (a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 miles square (in the Prairie Provinces 6 miles square); (b) villages with a population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute
(d) the county municipality; (e) cities in the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 10,000 and 15,000 respectively. In the other provinces they are incorporated under certain Municipal Codes and Acts. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councilors; the towns by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except a portion of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,729,665 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion (including territory added to the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba) comprise a little over 1,774,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands on the west.

The total population includes about 105,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories. They are under the supervision of Government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. According to the census of 1911 there were 27,774 Chinese in Canada, most of whom were in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

The number of immigrants arrived during the year ended 31st March, 1921, was 148,477, about one-third of whom belonged to the farming or farm-labouring class; 74,262 were from the United Kingdom, and 48,059 from the United States.

"Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; 45 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 6,732 "homesteads" were granted in 1920, covering an area of 1,077,120 acres. In 1919 there were 3,153 butter and cheese factories and 28 factories producing condensed milk and cream. The value of land, buildings and plant was $33,345,305. The number of persons employed in factories during the year was 11,072, and the amount paid for salaries and wages was $8,968,089.

### IMMIGRATION

Canada, with an area of 3,729,665 square miles, and with numerous resources of field, forest, mine and fisheries, has long been an attractive field for immigration. As long ago as 1882, settlers were entering Canada at the rate of more than 100,000 a year, and immediately preceding the outbreak of war the movement had reached figures approximating 400,000 persons per year. During the war period immigration from Great Britain was almost entirely discontinued and the movement fell to relatively small figures. Since 1918, however, there has again been a steady increase, the total movement of immigrants to Canada for the last fiscal year (1921) being 148,477.

In view of the world wide industrial conditions during the period of reconstruction only those types of immigrants which can readily be absorbed into the industries of the country, namely, farmers, farm labourers and domestic workers, have been generally encouraged to migrate to Canada. Artisans and skilled labourers are welcomed only as conditions afford assurance of their employment. A vigorous system of inspection of immigrants is in effect, and the immigrant must satisfy the Canadian officials that he is desirable, physically and morally, before he can gain admission into Canada. At the present time each adult immigrant is also required to have $250 in money, in addition to a ticket to his destination, and half that sum is required with respect to children. This regulation may be waived in the case of farmers, farm labourers or domestic workers coming to assured employment. Persons who are nationals of late enemy countries are not admitted as immigrants.

### PRODUCTS

The total yield of wheat in Canada for the year 1921 was returned as 300,888,100 bushels from 23,261,224 acres. The average yield per acre for Canada was 13 bushels. For oats the production was 426,232,900 bushels from 16,949,029 acres. The average yield per acre was 25.25 bushels.

The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The value of the yield in the calendar year 1920 was $49,241,339, and the number of men employed in connection with the fisheries was 75,696. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Manufactures have been very considerably developed, the value of the output being in 1918, $3,458,036,975 as compared with $1,381,547,225 in 1910.

### SHIPPING

The arrivals and clearances show, in the year 1920, a total tonnage of 110,046,211 tons. Engaged in sea going trade, 25,244,754 tons, 60,552,658 tons engaged in coasting trade, and 24,248,777 tons engaged on inland waters between Canada and the United States.

The number of steamers and sailing vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1919, was 8,573, with a net tonnage of 1,691,893. Of this number 4,442 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 982,749. The number of men and boys employed was over 46,954.

In 1920 the number of lights shown was 1,578, lightships 10, lightboats 1, and fog-alarm stations 12; the number of fog whistles, hand fog horns, fog bells, etc., was 336; the number of gas buoys, whistling buoys, bell buoys, and submarine bells, 461; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lightships, was 1,120.

### Railways

The increase in the railway mileage of Canada for the year ended December 31st, 1920, was 112 miles. The total railway mileage in actual operation on that date was 39,170 miles. On the same date the total amount of capital invested in Canadian railways was $2,170,030,123. Of this amount $1,043,785,048 represents debenture stocks and $846,234,166 funded debt.

During the year ended December 31st, 1920, the steam railways carried 51,318,422 passengers and 127,429,154 tons of freight. The total earnings during the year were $492,101,104. The operating expenses were $478,248,154 as against $376,789,083 in the previous year.

The aid granted in the form of cash subsidies, loans, subscription to shares, etc., by the
Dominion and Provincial Governments and Municipalities up to December 31st, 1920, is as follows:

**Dominion Government:**
- Cash subsidies: $115,849,561
- Loans: $58,076,533
- Cost of Lines handed over to C.P.R.: $37,785,319
- Paid to Quebec Government: $5,160,053
- Implement Clause of Gr. Tr. P. agreement: $4,994,416

Total: $221,865,882

**Provincial Governments:**
- $8,43,469,371
- Municipalities: $16,390,673

Grand Total: $281,725,926

The Dominion and Provincial Governments have also made land grants amounting to 46,537,256 acres.

The implement clause of the Grand Trunk Pacific agreement provides that the Government shall make up the difference between the amount realised in certain bonds and their par value. Since 1886 the aid granted to other railways includes the sum of $10,189,521 paid by the Government to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for land taken over by the Government from the Company's land subsidy.

On September 20th, 1917, an Act was passed authorising the Dominion Government to take over the Stock of the Canadian Northern System. This was appraised and finally acquired for $9,733,333 and the road taken over in September, 1919, and operated by the Government, through a Board of Directors. The total mileage of this system, including trackage rights, is 9,743.

In June, 1918, certain branch lines in New Brunswick were taken over by the Dominion Government, and during 1920 the Lotbiniere and Megantic, Caraquet and Gulf Short, Cape Breton, and Quebeco and Saguenay also became part of the Government railways. The system known as the Canadian Government Railways, to distinguish from the Canadian Northern system, both systems comprising the Canadian National Railways, now includes the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, Prince Edward Island and the several small lines, and operated in 1920 a total of 4,388·41 miles (including trackage rights). The Canadian Government Railways also operated under contract the St. John and Quebec Railway with 172·07 miles of track.

In March, 1920, the Government took over control of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and branch lines as receiver, and during the same month entered into an agreement with the Grand Trunk Railway Company whereby the Government agreed to acquire the preference and common stock of the company, the value to be determined by arbitration and to guarantee payment of dividends on the present guaranteed stock amounting to 12,500,000£, and payment of interest upon the present debenture stock aggregating 31,926,125£. Under this agreement the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian National Railways are now being operated as nearly as possible as one system.

The mileage operated-gross earnings, operating expenses and net operating revenue of the five large systems of Canada are as follows:

| System                  | Mileage Operated Including Trackage Rights |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Canadian Government     | 4,388·41 miles                            |
| St. John and Quebec     | 172·07                                    |
| Canadian Northern       | 9,742·70                                  |
| Grand Trunk             | 3,574·68                                  |
| Grand Trunk Pacific     | 2,874·16                                  |
| Canadian Pacific        | 13,492·20                                 |
| **Total**               | **34,154·22 miles**                       |

The total single track mileage operated in Canada was 39,383·59. Although there is some slight duplication of miles of track over which these five systems operate under trackage rights, they operate practically 87 per cent. of the total trackage.

| System                  | Gross Earnings | Operating Expenses | Net Operating Earnings |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Canadian Government     | $14,537,804    | $54,967,690        | $10,449,876 Loss       |
| Canadian Northern       | 65,103,916    | 81,544,291         | 16,440,415             |
| Grand Trunk             | 81,170,179    | 75,594,816         | 5,575,363 Net          |
| Grand Trunk Pacific     | 14,408,560    | 34,549,064         | 10,134,514 Loss        |
| Canadian Pacific        | 217,665,474   | 182,312,967        | 35,352,507 Net         |
| **Totals**              | **422,985,923**| **418,982,959**    | **$3,903,065**         |

Net Operating Income: $3,903,065

The Government lines—Grand Trunk Pacific, Grand Trunk and Canadian Pacific, the latter with 13,308 miles of track—comprise over 85% of the total mileage in Canada and form three transcontinental systems. The Canadian Pacific main line extends from St. John to Vancouver, about 3,367 miles. The Intercolonial and Canadian Northern main line extend from Halifax to Vancouver via Edmonton, while the Intercolonial from Halifax to Moncton, with the Transcontinental and Grand Trunk Pacific from Moncton to Prince Rupert, constitutes the third great transcontinental railway.

**Telegraphs.**

There are 49,576 miles of telegraph line, and 224,662 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 12,505, including 336 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 15,308,283 land messages were sent in 1920 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 4,683. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. Wireless Telegraphy.—In 1920 there were 46 Radio-telegraph stations operated in the public service of Canada, having a range of 100 to 750 nautical miles. Messages sent and received were 341,333. At Glace Bay near Cape Breton, N.S., there is a long-distance station with a range of 3,000 nautical miles; one at Newcastle, N.B., with a range of 2,500 nautical miles; and also one at Barrington Passage, N.S., with a range of 1,500 nautical miles. Thirty-nine Government steamers are equipped with wireless apparatus having a range of 100 to 400 miles. The telephone is very generally used. On the 31st Decem-
ber, 1920, there were 856,266 telephones and 2,105,101 miles of telephone wire in use. The earnings amounted to $33,473,712, and the operating expenses to $28,044,401. On December 31st, 1920, the capital liability of telephones in Canada was $116,683,705, of which $36,149,838 are stocks and $80,539,867 are funded debt.

There were, on March 31st, 1920, 768 electric light companies in Canada. Every Province of the Dominion is supplied with the electric light.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 2624 miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts for the year 1919 were $387,655, and the working expenses, including repairs, $1,431,969. Over one hundred and seventy-one million dollars have been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not yet been reimposed.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills, $4.863 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

The Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint was established in pursuance of The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., c. 4), under which an annual sum not exceeding $75,000 is payable to the Imperial Treasury for the purpose of defraying the salaries of officials and other expenses of the Mint, the fees and all sums received being retained by Canada.

Memorandum of gold, silver, and bronze coin struck and issued by the Ottawa Mint during the calendar years 1919 and 1920:

| Description of Coins | 1919 | 1920 |
|----------------------|------|------|
| Gold (Sovereigns)    | 135,889 | 171,042 |
|                      | or $661,326.47 | or $832,404.40 |

| Bronze               | 112,013.47 | 115,100.00 |

The Mint issues gold, silver and copper coins for circulation in Canada, and sovereigns and half-sovereigns coined are legal tender in every country under the British flag.

The Savings Banks, under the charge of the Government, on March 31st, 1920, had $42,334,812 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit on March 31st, 1919, $46,799,877, and on March 31st, 1920, $53,118,053. In addition all the 18 chartered banks have savings banks branches, but the returns to the Government do not specify the amounts on deposits in these branches.

The following banks were established in Canada, August, 1921:

Ontario—(Headquarters).
Bank of Toronto. Imperial Bank.
Dominion Bank. Bank of Hamilton.
Standard Bank.

Canadian Bank of Commerce.
Home Bank of Canada.

* Excluding capital and rest or reserve fund.
In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1930 amounted to $15,501,360, and at March 31st, 1921, to $77,882,285. Under the Dominion Notes Act, 1914 (5 Geo. V. c. 4), the Dominion Government is authorized to issue notes up to and including $50,000,000 against a reserve in gold equal to one quarter of the amount. By Chapter 4, Acts of 1915, "an Act respecting the issue of Dominion Notes," the Dominion Government is authorized to issue notes up to $26,000,000 without any reserve of gold, $16,000,000 of the notes to be against certain specified Canadian railway securities guaranteed by the Dominion Government. Notes may be issued to any additional amount in excess of $76,000,000, but (except as provided by the Finance Act, 1914), an amount of gold equal to the excess must be held. Thus Dominion notes are under normal conditions gold certificates. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government. On July 1st, 1912, the Dominion Government issued five dollar notes for the first time.

Post Office.

The number of offices in 1920 was 12,251. The net revenue for the year ended March 31st, 1920, was $24,449,917, and the expenditure $20,774,385. At the end of the fiscal years 1919-20, there were 3,737 rural mail delivery routes, on which were erected 189,081 boxes; the corresponding figures for the fiscal year 1919 were 3,705 routes and 181,505 boxes.

On March 31, 1920, there were 5,106 Money Order offices; Orders issued, 9,947,018, value $159,224,937. During the year ended March 31, 1920, the Dominion Government paid $1,632,906 in Ocean Mail subsidies and steamship subventions.

The mail communication with Great Britain is now two or three times a week via Montreal or Quebec and New York in summer, and via Halifax or St. John and New York in winter. With the West Indies there is a fortnightly mail service via Halifax, and from three to four trips per week via United States ports. There is a through service twice a day across the continent from Halifax on the Atlantic to Vancouver on the Pacific coast by the Canadian Pacific and Intercolonial Railways, a monthly direct steam service with New Zealand and via New Zealand with Australia via Vancouver. With Japan and China there is a direct connection by steamer from Vancouver once every two weeks throughout the year.

The rates of postage are as follows:

**Letters.**—To Canada, United States and Mexico, *3 cents for the first oz., 2 cents for each additional oz.*; Great Britain and all other places within the Empire, *4 cents for the first oz., 3 cents for each additional oz.*; other countries, 10 cents for the first oz., 5 cents for each additional oz.

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-Laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 36, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1856 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stats., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each Province (Ontario, 111 members; Quebec, 81 members), elected for four years in Ontario and five years in Quebec by general suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $15 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $1,400. Members in Quebec receive $2,500 for each session of more than 30 days. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $2,500 as sessional indemnity.

Industry.

The industrial wealth of Ontario is derived, primarily, from its farms, its forests, mines and fisheries; secondarily, from its manufactures. In 1920, the value of the farm land, buildings, implements and live stock of the province was $1,808,644,816. There are over 14,897,839 acres of cleared farm land. The farms average 115 acres in extent, of which 81% are owned by the occupants. The average value of farm products per acre is greater than in any other province, and the total production is placed at $367,608,619 in 1920. Dairying and the breeding and feeding of live stock are combined with general farming. The value of the cheese factory output is at present about $40,000,000 annually. The total dairy output is valued at $30,000,000, the live stock output at $152,213,847.

All the fruits usually grown in the temperate zone may be produced in Ontario, not only suc-
successfully, but in a very high degree of excellence. Apples constitute the principal crop, but tender fruits such as peaches, pears, plums and grapes, are very extensively grown in the Niagara peninsula. The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables is a well established industry. From 700,000 to 1,000,000 barrels of apples are exported annually under normal conditions, chiefly to Great Britain.

The value of the output of the mines and mineral industries of Ontario in 1919 was $58,883,916, as compared with $80,308,972 in 1918. This decrease was due in large part to the curtailed output of nickel-copper matte. The quantity of gold produced in 1919 was 505,964 ounces, valued at $10,451,709. The aggregate value of gold produced in Ontario to December 31st, 1919, was $61,316,572. Since the discovery of silver at Cobalt, in 1903 to 1918, shipments from the camp and outlying silver areas were 292,385,866 ounces, valued at $50,864,863. In 1919 the quantity of silver produced was 11,363,252 ounces worth $12,904,312, as compared with 17,738,133 ounces, worth $17,415,882 in 1918. The quantity of nickel in the form of matte produced in Ontario in 1919 was 22,035 tons. The copper in the form of matte was 12,099 tons. Of the total production of 42,735 tons of nickel-copper matte, 11,099 tons were shipped to Canadian refineries, 22,016 tons to the United States, and 3,191 tons to Great Britain. The total value of nickel produced was $11,925,220, and of copper $3,709,687.

Quebec is growing rapidly through its agriculture, its industry and its mines. The municipalities of the Province have a total area of 25,571,330 acres, which is about one-ninth of the total area, excluding the northern part, called New Quebec, which was annexed in 1912.

Most farmers own their farms, and the chief products are hay, oats and potatoes.

The value of the field crops, for the year 1920, is estimated at $330,000,000, compared with $38,000,000 for the year previous to the war (1913).

The raising of beef cattle is a business of considerable importance in the Eastern Townships, and throughout the Province mixed farming is a general practice.

Dairying is one of the most important industries on the farm. The total yield of the butter and cheese manufactured was close to $37,000,000 in 1920. The butter of the Province of Quebec is renowned for its flavour, and has taken first prizes in International competitions, and the cheese commands the highest prices paid on the Montreal market by exporters to Europe.

In industrial development, Quebec is making rapid progress. The census of 1911 shows that the total value of manufactured products was $350,901,656; during the last decade the growth has been quite phenomenal. A preliminary statement published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics shows that the industrial production of Quebec for 1919 had a value of $890,420,028. Montreal's share of that production was $551,814,605.

Amongst the most important industries are the following: lumber, pulp, paper, shipbuilding and repairs, slaughtering and meat packing, boots and shoes, flour and grist mill products, foundries, cotton, printing and publishing, leather, fur garments, cloth, tobacco, cigars, syrup and maple sugar, drugs and chemicals, liquors and malt, paints and varnishes.

To those interested in the mining industry, the Province of Quebec offers an attractive diversity of geological formations, including the Keewatin, Laurentian and Huronian, containing gold, silver, lead, nickel, copper, iron, zinc, phosphate, mica and granite.

In the Eastern Townships are located the well renowned mines of asbestos. Their production, which had a value of only $2,677,829 in 1910, reached in 1920 a production estimated at $10,932,289. The Province produces also several of the so called "War minerals," such as pyrite, molybdenite, magnesite, chromite, the mining of which received a very strong impetus during the hostilities. Cement ranks next to asbestos in production, with a value of $4,337,572 in 1920; then comes bricks, of which the output was, for the same year, $1,179,624.

While land values, both in town and country, show a steady improvement in this Province from year to year, Quebec has never experienced the speculative crisis that have characterized real estate transactions elsewhere, especially during the years previous to the war. During the war, production was greatly intensified in the Province, and every fiscal year ended with a material surplus. Quebec was the only Province where the moratorium was not imposed during the hostilities, and its credit, on the foreign markets, instead of diminishing, during the last years was increasing, and, hence, has largely escaped the financial stringency of the after-war readjustment.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for the elementary (public and separate) the continuation and high schools (including collegiate institutes) and the Industrial, Technical and Art schools of which there are 7,126, with 611,450 scholars (exclusive of evening school pupils) in 1920. The schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and four theological colleges are also affiliated. There are also two non-denominational and two denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges (private foundations) for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile offenders of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Public libraries receive liberal Government grants.

The entire school organization in the Province of Quebec is under the immediate control of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who is under the Provincial Secretary. The Superintendent is assisted by an English Secretary and a French Secretary, who have the rank of deputy-minister. To a Council of Public Instruction is delegated certain large powers, and it is divided into two Committees, a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, and each of these Committees have the right to make the Regulations in regard to the organization and discipline of their respective schools. These powers include the making of the course of study, the authorization of text books, the issuing of diplomas and all such matters as directly affect the internal management of the schools. The local control is vested in local elective boards. The
schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1920, 7,589 schools, with 516,968 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and fourteen normal schools supported by the Government. There are also forestry schools, dairy schools, trade schools, technical schools, schools for agriculture, schools for higher commercial studies and classical colleges, and four universities—two protestant: McGill University (Montreal) and Bishop's College (Lennoxville) and two Catholic: Laval University (Quebec) and Montreal University (Montreal).

78% of the children of school age, from 5 to 18 years, attend school.

In 1898, the schools' contributions were $2,808,121; ten years later, they amounted to $4,665,537; in 1918-19, they were $14,698,708.

The average cost of education per pupil in the Province of Quebec has increased rapidly; in 1900, it was $9.87; in 1910, $15.72; in 1919, $32.58.

Climate.

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal 42°; the extreme range being from 20° below zero to 96°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 26 inches; at Montreal 27 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is about 98 inches on the average at Montreal.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the census of 1921 was 524,579.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I. in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the last census 57,674. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Dartmouth, Digby, Glace Bay, Kentville, New Glasgow, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney, Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney and New Glasgow, and these centres are developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the year ended 30th September, 1920, is as follows:

- Coal raised ... 5,678,970 long tons.
- Gypsum ... 179,600 tons.
- Limestone ... 249,903 tons.
- Brick ... 18,383,985 No.
- Drain pipe and tiles ... 1,164,270 feet.
- Coke ... 382,608 tons.
There are large deposits of other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe. A crop of 1,000,000 barrels is regarded as an average.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. The value of the catch of fish in 1920 was $13,890,000. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and plants for the construction of steel ships have been constructed at New Glasgow and at Halifax. A large mill for the manufacturing of steel ships' plates has been constructed at Sydney. Bonuses are offered to encourage the establishment of such plants.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°.

**Constitution.**

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 16 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of ten members (four of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 43 representatives elected every five years.

**Education.**

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by a Board of Commissioners partly appointed by the Town Council and partly by the Government.

In 1920 there were 1,774 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 108,096. 3,658 attended the technical schools. Education is compulsory in towns, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

Under "The Technical Education Act," of 1907, local technical schools have been established in all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" has been established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college is the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,177 square miles, or about 17,393,410 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population in 1921, was 388,092.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 19° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 76 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which
or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. about 9,000), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 42,511). Other towns are Moncton (11,345), Chatham (4,666), Woodstock (3,856), and St. Stephen (2,836).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 11 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 48 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $1,000 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were in 1920, 1,898 schools and 72,785 scholars, exclusive of normal and model schools, which had an enrolment of 472.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Area and Situation.

Manitoba became a Province of the Canadian Federation by legislative enactments taking effect on the 15th July, 1870. It is bounded on the north by the 60th parallel of latitude; on the west by the Eastern boundary of the Province of Saskatchewan; on the south by the United States; on the east by the western boundary of the Province of Ontario to Hudson's Bay, and by Hudson's Bay for a distance of 300 miles.

The area of Manitoba is 251,332 square miles, of which 232,000 square miles are land and about 20,000 square miles are water.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced.

Manitoba No. 1 Northern, because of its superior milling qualities, is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous. Winnipeg is now the leading grain market on the Continent. There is a steady trend toward diversified agriculture in Manitoba and but few farmers now confine their activities solely to grain growing.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle, bacon and dairy products. In 1920 the production was as follows:

| Crop       | Area   | Yield per acre | Total yield |
|------------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Wheat      | 2,687,500 | 13·96          | 37,542,000  |
| Oats       | 1,855,000 | 31·08          | 57,657,000  |
| Barley     | 831,000  | 21·08          | 17,520,000  |
| Rye        | 148,602  | 15·50          | 2,318,600   |
| Peas       | 4,162    | 15·00          | 62,200      |
| Mixed Grains | 28,800  | 21·25          | 612,000     |

The average yield of wheat per acre for ten years is 17·04 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Free grant lands are still available in several districts into which new railways are being projected. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $20 to $50 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 215 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is about 270,000, including suburbs. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Manitou, Deloraine, Dauphin, Souris, Virden, St. Boniface, Morris, Swan River, Gimli and The Pas.

Coal of the light variety is to be found in practically unlimited quantities in the Souris Valley. Utilization of this coal by briquetting is being investigated by a Commission which has reported favourably on the possibilities as revealed by practical experiment. Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful. A sand suitable for glass is found in great quantities, and the industry is being developed. Gold, copper and other valuable minerals have been discovered in great quantities in different parts of the province, particularly in the new territory North of the Saskatchewan River, also to the Eats of Lake Winnipeg. Development, retarded by the war, is proceeding apace, and Manitoba, hitherto regarded as an agricultural province, gives every promise of becoming the premier mining province of the Dominion.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg, the annual output has grown from $8,616,248 in 1901 to $95,000,000 in 1919. There are now 460 factories, employing over 20,000 workers, with a capital invested of $80,000,000, and manufacturing is growing also in other centres of the Province.

The Winnipeg Power Plant on the Winnipeg River, 77 miles from the City of Winnipeg, now develops about 40,000 h.p. and is capable of developing 100,000 h.p., is owned and operated by the City. The cost of energy is from 1/2 to 3 cents. per K.W. hour, and household lighting is supplied at 3 cents. per K.W. hour. The plant is being increased at a cost of nearly $2,000,000.

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains. At the close of 1921 there were in the province of Manitoba 4,463 miles of railways in operation. These railways afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.
Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 96°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual snowfall (November to March) is 53 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 6 members in the Dominion Senate and 15 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 55 members elected by adult suffrage, for 5 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876. The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $1,800 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, a system of national schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school." Attendance is compulsory to the age of 14.

In 1921, there were 1,893 schools in operation, employing 3,708 teachers and with an enrolment of 129,015 pupils. Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with an enrolment in 1920 of 1,570 students. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical.

Manitoba also has an Agricultural College with an enrolment in 1921, of 329 in regular courses and 622 in short courses.

**BRITISH COLUMBIA.**

**Situation and Area.**

British Columbia is the western province of the Dominion of Canada, situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprising the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian to the 54th parallel, and the Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.

The length of the coast line in a direct line north and south, is 541 miles, but the total length, following the sinuosities of the coast, is 4,334 miles, exclusive of islands. The coastline of Vancouver Island is 1,884 miles, and the length 288 miles. The area (including Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Island) is about 383,000 square miles. The distinguishing physical features of British Columbia are the great mountain ranges which intersect the country in parallel lines, the general direction being north and south; the extensive plateaux of the central interior; the rich valleys which produce in abundance all kinds of agricultural produce; the vast forests of commercial timber; and the deeply indented seaboard. The population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173; 1901, 190,000; 1911, 392,480; 1919 (estimated) 650,000.

**History.**

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, in consequence of the large immigration on the discovery of gold in the Thompson and Fraser Rivers. Vancouver Island was granted to the Hudson's Bay Company under certain conditions in 1849, and the same year it was made a Crown colony. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united under the former name, and on July 20th, 1871, British Columbia entered the Dominion of Canada as a Province. The Province is represented by six members in the Senate, and thirteen members in the House of Commons of Canada.

**Constitution.**

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and an Executive Council, or Cabinet, of eight Ministers, members of the legislative assembly of 47 members, on the British system of ministerial responsibility. The House of Assembly is elected for five years, every male and female adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the Province and duly registered, being entitled to a vote. In 1917 by the Provincial Elections Amendment Act, the franchise was extended to women. Members of the Legislature receive a sessional indemnity of $2,000, and a mileage allowance for travelling expenses.

**Crown Land and Surveys.**

The area of the Province of British Columbia is 238,489,600 acres. Of this area about 12,000,000 acres are crown granted, 4,000,000 granted to Railway Companies, 21,000,000 acres controlled by the Dominion Government, and about 2,000,000 acres in process of alienation, leaving about 200,000,000 acres available for disposition under the various Land Acts. About 10,000,000 acres are held under timber licences or leases, 650,000 acres under grazing or coal leases, and 1,900,000 acres under parks and game reserves. A total of 19,737,585 acres of land have been surveyed, 7,371,814 acres of which are surveys of timber areas, and 329,910 acres of mineral claims. Approximately 2,000,000 acres of surveyed lands are available for free preemption. Geographic and land maps can be obtained on application to the Department of Lands.

**Agriculture.**

Agriculture in British Columbia has progressed steadily during the past four years. Mixed farming, stockraising, dairying, fruit-growing, poultry raising, and truck-gardening are the principal sources of agricultural production in the Province.

**Value of Agricultural Products.**

1920 total, $68,926,090—livestock $14,014,873; meats $4,217,212; poultry and eggs $4,157,694; fruit $7,772,474; vegetables $7,411,195; fodders $15,012,233; and grains $6,088,913.

Arable land in British Columbia is estimated to be about 22,600,000 acres, or 10 per cent. of the total area, of which the area at present under cultivation is only 2½ per cent., and 12 per cent. of the total area occupied as farm land. The total number of farms is estimated to be 15,146.

**Mining Industry.**

The total mineral production of British Columbia to the end of the year 1920 amounted in value to $706,230,519, towards which sum gold has contributed $178,702,732; coal and coke $213,161,793; copper $161,146,385; and silver $53,697,628.

A great advance is being made in metalliferous mining—particularly copper mining—the output of this metal alone in 1919 amounted in value to $20,142,155 (increase $105,157), as compared with $9,835,500 in 1915, this increase being due to the opening up of new properties chiefly in the coast district.
Collieries produced net production of 2,712,228 tons valued at $13,561,149, and 68,190 tons of coke valued at $477,330.

The minerals of the Province chiefly consist of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, and coal. Approximately 230,000 square miles of country still remain to be explored for minerals.

Detailed reports are obtainable from the Bureau of Mines, Victoria.

Forest Wealth.

The stand of merchantable timber in the Province of British Columbia is estimated to reach the enormous total of four billion (400,000,000,000) feet board measure, which is over half the total of all Canada. The annual cut is at present in the neighbourhood of 1,700,000,000 feet board measure.

British Columbia occupies an especially advantageous position for supplying the overseas markets. It has vast quantities of timber unsurpassed in size, quality and suitability for the manufacture of all kinds of dimension timber, lumber, piling, railway ties, pulp, paper, and other products. The principal export timber trees of British Columbia are Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Western Hemlock, and Sitka Spruce or Silver Spruce. The total production from British Columbia forests during 1920 was 2,046,468,959 Feet, Board Measure, value $92,628,807.

Water Resources.

All the water in rivers and streams of the Province is in the right of the Crown and may be appropriated for various purposes under the rules and regulations of the Water Act. Of these purposes the most important is Power and Irrigation. In respect of the first mentioned, there is probably no area on the continent of America so favoured in water power resources. Large power sites are strategically situated so that in time many districts may be served with electrical energy by transmission lines of economic length. It is of interest to note that contiguous to Vancouver, the largest centre of population, within a radius of one hundred miles, there is available well over 750,000 horse power, of which over 150,000 is developed, while 250,000 horse power is developed on the Kootenay River near Nelson, and is supplying smelters at Trail and Grand Forks. In regard to irrigation, such is largely practiced south of the 51st parallel of latitude. Water has been recorded for upwards of 600,000 acres of lands, of which approximately 100,000 have been brought under cultivation. Our fruit areas depend largely, if not wholly, upon irrigation. The largest and one of the most important of these is the Okanagan Valley, which now has a well-established fruit and vegetable industry. Through co-operation in production and marketing, those areas dependent upon irrigation are becoming very attractive.

Fisheries.

The commercial fisheries of British Columbia are of considerable importance. Salmon, halibut, and herring are the principal food fishes, and cod, colaschans, pilchard, clams, oysters, shrimps, etc., are also produced in large quantities. The whale fisheries are also a not unimportant branch of the fishing industry.

Value of total production, 1918, $27,282,223; 1919, $22,329,161, 44 per cent. of Canada's production.

Shipbuilding.

Both wooden and steel ships are now being constructed in the Province. The demand for tonnage will doubtless continue for years to come, and it is believed the shipbuilding industry will give an impetus to development of the iron deposits of British Columbia, resulting in the manufacture of local steel for use in the shipyards.

Railways.

British Columbia has 5,280 miles (including 1,002 miles of Industrial and Common Carriers) of railway in operation. The Canadian Pacific Railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, the Canadian Northern Railway, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, are the main railways of the Province, with various branches of the Canadian Pacific Railway extending through the southern and south-western portions of the Province, and additional lines entering the Province from the United States.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in municipal school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether cities of the first, second or third class, or district municipalities) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 48 high schools, 235 teachers, 6,636 scholars in the Province. The number of public schools in operation is 854, under 2,332 teachers. The total enrolment of high and public schools is 79,243. Total number of teachers employed, including manual training and domestic science, 2,557. The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is permitted to be taught. Schools are established wherever there are 10 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.
This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64½° W. long. Its area is 1,356,120 acres, or 2,133 square miles; it is about 130 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of the inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census (1911) was 93,728.

Description.
The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous grain mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established. The breeding and raising of silver and black foxes in captivity is an important industry, there being about 363 fox ranches in the province.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,080) and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

Constitution.
Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $500 per annum.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is
also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

Education.

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of the Executive Council and the Chief Supt. of Education and the Principal of Prince of Wales College. The local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There were in 1918, 468 schools, with 17,861 pupils. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic University not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens.

Finance.

The province has a large sum to its credit at Ottawa, from which it draws interest. There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a road tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

Total Revenue for the year ended 31st Dec., 1920 ... $739,770.58
Total Expenditure, same year $736,517.36

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put
into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed out of the southern portion of the Territories, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South being meridian 110 West of Greenwich.

SASKATCHEWAN.

Saskatchewan, called after the river of the same name, meaning "rapid current," has an area of 250,650 sq. miles, and a population in 1916 of 647,835 persons, an increase of 155,403 over that of 1911. It lies between 102°-110° West and 49°-60° North, with Manitoba on the East and Alberta on the West. The Government consists of a Lieut.-Governor, an Executive Council and a representative Assembly of 63 members. The Province is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 16 members in the House of Commons, and 6 in the Senate. The seat of Government is at Regina (named in honour of Queen Victoria).

The remarks regarding the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to Saskatchewan. The crop area for 1921 was: Wheat, 11,651,622 acres; oats, 4,884,900; barley, 427,798; flax, 366,858; rye, 1,038,507 acres. Free grants of lands can still be had, and there are millions of acres awaiting settlement and cultivation. The agricultural industry of the Province has made phenomenal progress, and marked development is seen in manufacturing spheres.

The following are the financial figures for 1920-21:

Alberta, as noted above, was erected into a Province by an enactment of the Parliament of Canada, taking effect September 1st, 1905, out of the territory acquired from the Hudson's Bay Company. Previously it formed part of the North-West Territories. The total area of the Province is 255,585 square miles, including about 2,500 square miles of water. The Government is vested in a Lieut.-Governor, an Executive Council, and a Legislative Assembly composed of sixty-one (61) members elected by the people, for five years. The Executive Council consists of eight Members. The seat of Government is Edmonton.

The population of Alberta increased from 73,022, in 1901, to 496,525, in 1916. The census figures are:

Alberta has 85 per cent. of the coal resources of the Dominion, and 7 per cent. of the coal resources of the world. It has some anthracite, but very large supplies of domestic, and also steam and coking coal. Coal beds cover over half the area of the province. The production of coal mines for 1920 was approximately 6,500,000 tons. It has valuable fish and timber resources in the centre and north, and is noted for its game of all kinds.

The total area in crops, 1920, was 8,381,877 acres. Of this 7,909,542 was in grain.

NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES AND YUKON.

The North-West Territories now consist of the territories formerly known as Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory, except such portions thereof as form the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Yukon Territory, together with all British Territories and possessions in North America and all islands adjacent thereto not included within any province, except the colony of Newfoundland and its dependencies.

By Order in Council dated 16th March, 1918, this area is sub-divided into three provisional districts to be known as the districts of Mackenzie, Keewatin, and Franklin. This Order in Council came effective on the 1st January, 1920. The territories are governed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, with a council of not more than six members, also appointed by the Governor-General, and the Commissioner in Council is empowered to make ordinances for the Territories.

The boundaries of the Yukon Territory were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 6th August, 1897, amended by C. 41 of Ed. VII. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61-62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior. The Office of Commissioner was abolished by Order in Council under the War Measures Act on the 12th March, 1918, his duties being transferred to the Gold Commissioner. From 1896 to 31st March, 1921, the Yukon produced $158,565,300 of minerals. The production was at its maximum in the year 1900. There has been a gradual falling off in the output since that time. The value of the gold produced in 1920 was $1,246,486.29. The population is about 5,000.
