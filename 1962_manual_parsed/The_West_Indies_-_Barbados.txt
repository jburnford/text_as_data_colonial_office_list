Cayman Islands

Area
The Islands consist of Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Their total area is about 100 square miles.

Population
At the 1960 census the population was 8,803: Grand Cayman 7,271, Cayman Brac 1,508, Little Cayman 24. Classification according to racial origin is not yet available, but is roughly one sixth of African, one half of mixed and one third of European descent.

(Note.—The above figures include 1,187 persons absent on census night, almost all of whom were seamen.)

Principal Towns
Georgetown and West Bay on Grand Cayman have populations of about 2,400 each.

Geographical Features
The principal island, Grand Cayman, is about 178 miles to the west of Jamaica. It is about 22 miles in length, with a breadth varying from four to eight miles: very low-lying, it is difficult to sight from the sea. Little Cayman is geographically similar. Cayman Brac is distinguished from the other islands by a massive central limestone bluff. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs enclosing a few fair harbours. Grand Cayman has a magnificent six-mile beach. There are no rivers in any of the islands.

Climate
From November to March it is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north and temperatures range from 60° to 75°. In the summer the range of temperature is some 10° higher and during certain periods mosquitoes abound. The rainfall at Georgetown averages 50 inches per annum. Hurricanes occur at intervals, as in 1876, 1903, 1909, 1917, 1932 and 1944. The 1932 hurricane was particularly disastrous to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. A meteorological station at Georgetown, operated jointly with the Government of Cuba, makes an important contribution to the Caribbean hurricane warning system. During 1956 a combined British and American weather station specifically for hurricane research was established on Grand Cayman.

History
The islands were discovered by Columbus in 1503. No settlement was made, but they were frequently visited by ships for revictualling purposes. By the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, when Jamaica was ceded to the British Crown the Cayman Islands were also ceded. The earliest record of a grant of land to settlers is dated 1734. Due to their inaccessibility, the islands were for long a favoured refuge for those seeking to escape from justice. The population in 1774 was 176, in 1802 it had risen to 933, of whom 545 were slaves. In the past century the population has steadily risen. In 1863 the administrative arrangements which had grown up for the internal administration of the Islands were ratified by Act of Parliament.

Constitution
By Order in Council brought into effect on the 4th July 1959, provision was made for the government of the Cayman Islands, superseding the old constitution which was established by an Act of the Imperial Parliament of 1863. The Order constitutes the distinct office of Governor of the Cayman Islands and provides for the Governor of Jamaica to hold that office, and to administer the government of the Islands through an Administrator, who replaces the Commissioner. It also constitutes an Executive Council consisting of the Administrator when the Governor is present and presiding, and two official and three non-official members. There is a Legislative Assembly consisting of the Administrator as President, two or three official members appointed by the Governor, two or three nominated non-official members appointed by the Governor, and twelve members elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Assembly elects a Deputy President of the Assembly who presides in the absence of the Administrator and two of the non-official members of the Executive Council.

The Legislature of Jamaica has power to make laws for the Cayman Islands, provided that no Jamaican Law applies in the Islands unless:

(i) it is in express terms made applicable thereto, and
(ii) the Governor declares by Proclamation that the particular law shall apply to the Cayman Islands, with such modifications as he may specify.

Land Policy
All land is individually owned. There is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation
A poll tax of £1 per adult male between the ages of 18 and 60 is collected annually. An ad valorem Customs duty of 20% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. There is a preferential tariff on certain Commonwealth goods.

Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1956–57  | 116,267    | 109,508        |
| 1957–58  | 156,130    | 179,567        |

| 1960 (Apr.–Dec.) | 155,329 | 147,513        |
It is estimated that in 1960 £117,044 was derived from Customs receipts and £11,400 from the sale of postage stamps. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were Treasury, Customs and Post Office £18,635, Education £19,710, Medical £22,791 and Public Works Recurrent £14,141.

The Public Debt as at 31st December 1960 was as follows:

Road and Airport Resurfacing loans, 1958: outstanding £80,000.

Currency

The currency in circulation is Jamaica notes and British silver of all denominations.

Development

The Islands have, under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act, an allocation of £65,000. A road improvement programme was recently completed, linking the three main centres of population in Grand Cayman, and a new elementary school was opened during 1960 in Georgetown. Projects planned include public buildings, road and harbour improvements and improvements of social services.

In the last few years a number of hotels catering for tourists have been opened on Grand Cayman.

Education

There is compulsory free elementary education in ten Government schools; total enrolment in 1960 was 987 pupils. Expenditure in 1960 (March–December) amounted to £19,710 compared with £1,312 in 1940. There are two private Secondary Schools in Grand Cayman. One of them receives financial support from Government.

Libraries

There is a well-equipped public library in Georgetown, Grand Cayman.

Health

Expenditure on Medical and Health services during 1960 (April–December) was £22,791 compared with £504 in 1940. The hospital has accommodation for 28 patients. Medical Officers are seconded from Jamaica. A District Surgeon, to whom a retainer from public funds is paid, has been in practice in Grand Cayman since December 1957. A District Surgeon has been appointed to Cayman Brac.

Communications

Owen Roberts airfield in Grand Cayman is used by B.W.I.A. and Lineas Aereas Costaricenses, S.A. There are regular air services between Grand Cayman and Kingston, Miami, San José (Costa Rica) and Panama City. A 3,250 ft. airstrip has been constructed in Cayman Brac and a regular service by light aircraft is in operation.

A monthly motor vessel service is maintained between Kingston, Tampa (Florida) and all three islands. There is also more or less regular communication with Central American ports by sailing and motor vessels.

Motorable roads connect all districts in Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac; there is a motorable track in Little Cayman.

Wireless stations are maintained by Government at Georgetown, Grand Cayman, and at Stake Bay, Cayman Brac. Wireless communication exists between Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. There are no broadcasting services.

Principal Occupations

The chief industry next to the tourist industry is catching turtle, which are brought to Grand Cayman before export. Some of the inhabitants engage in other fishing pursuits and in agriculture, but the mainstay of the economy of the islands is the fact that Caymanians are first-class seamen and readily find employment with overseas shipping companies. Their remittances to their families enable a standard of living to be maintained considerably higher than the islands' own resources could justify. There are also some excellent shipwrights, though ship construction is now only sporadic. Trade union legislation is in existence, and one union, the Global Seaman's Union, has been registered. There is little unemployment.

Crops and Products

The islands are not self-supporting in foodstuffs. The production of food crops and raising of cattle are restricted by the character of the limestone soil. The main export products of importance are turtle and thatch rope. The manufacture of thatch rope was at one time the mainstay of the poorer people, but the industry is now in decline.

Dominica

Area and Population

The area is approximately 289·8 square miles, and the population at the last census (7th April 1960) was 59,916.

Principal Town

Roseau is the capital and has a population of about 10,422.

Geographical Features

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island. The island is well-watered.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good; during the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd July 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1761, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783 it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

Until 1940 Dominica was grouped with the Leeward Islands.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 175) except that provision is made for eleven elected members in the Legislative Council.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 4c for every dollar of the first $500 to 50c for every dollar over $10,000 of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 37½% on every dollar of chargeable income. Ad valorem duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 5% to 35% preferential and 3% to 75% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on most products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

Grenada

Area
The total area of the Colony is 133 square miles. In addition to the island of Grenada it includes certain of the small islands known as the Grenadines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area of about 13 square miles.

Population
The population at the census on 7th April 1960 of 88,677 is for the most part coloured. There is a small white population, a number of Indians and a small community of the descendants of early white settlers.

Principal Town
The capital, St. George's, has a population of 7,305.

Geographical Features
In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat disordered topography of mountains and fairly deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of mountains traverses the whole length, closer to the western than the eastern coastline. The highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet), Fedon's Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua (2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along the east and south-east the mountains slope gradually towards the sea. The south coast is deeply indented by numerous natural harbours. The island is well-watered by quick-flowing streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approximately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800 feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate
Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in the mountains of the interior, with an average range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months January to May are relatively dry, June to December relatively wet, August being the driest month and November the wettest.

History
Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company of London merchants attempted to form a settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of 1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased the island from the French West India Company to whom it had been granted by the King of France and established a settlement at St. George's. This venture did not pay and Du Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the French Company and passed to the Crown of France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island was formally ceded to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being preoccupied with the American War of Independence, Grenada was retaken by the French, but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795-96 a rebellion against British rule was instigated by a French Republican from Guadeloupe. The rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution
The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua (see page 175).

Taxation
Forms of direct taxation include income tax, estate duties and property tax. Income tax is based on a graduated scale, varying from 5 cents to 65 cents in the $ for individuals (on chargeable income for the year immediately preceding the year of assessment). Companies pay at the rate of 37½ per cent. There is a land tax of 24 cents per acre and house tax is levied on a sliding scale varying from $1.20 per house of rental value between $24 and $28.80 per annum to 8½% in the case of houses with rental value over $144 per annum. Other forms of taxation include import, export and excise duties.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1956 | $4,862,632 | $5,009,050 |
| 1957 | $4,575,584 | $5,093,817 |
| 1958 | $5,467,867 | $5,899,994 |
| 1959 | $7,482,470 | $7,005,526 |
| 1960 | $8,115,021 | $7,656,046 |

At the end of 1960 the Public Debt amounted to $12,613,834 (including a Hurricane Rehabilitation Loan from the United Kingdom Government of $7,200,000) and accumulated Sinking Funds to $967,589.

Currency
The currency of the Colony is the West Indian dollar which is linked to sterling at the rate of $4·80 to the £.

Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands and Trinidad) in a common currency.

Notes issued by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) and the Royal Bank of Canada continue as legal tender but are being withdrawn and the banks' powers of note issue have been terminated. Meanwhile United Kingdom coinage has also largely been replaced by the Board's own dollar coinage, though the diminishing United Kingdom coinage continues as legal tender.

Development Plans
Under the 1945, 1950 and 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts Grenada received allocations totalling £1,131,121; a further allocation of £540,000 was made under the 1959 Act.

Other Development
Progress has been made in the direction of attracting external investment for the development of the tourist industry which the Colony is not in a position to finance. A step forward has also been made in setting out Government's policy regarding Morne Rouge development in the interest of tourism.
Education

There were 55 primary schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 23,189 pupils at 31st December 1960. Average attendance in 1960 was 18,286 or 79.2% of the total enrolment. Compulsory attendance is not at present enforced. Twelve of the primary schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned buildings of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are two handicraft centres. In addition three schools have well-equipped handicraft rooms. There are also three domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at two other schools. A visual education unit serves the whole Colony. A filmstrip library service with four projectors is maintained. Six secondary schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,687 (end 1960). Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one is co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate standard and the Grenada Boys' Secondary School, the Presentation Boys' College, the St. Joseph's Convent, St. George's and the Anglican High School also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1960 was $937,744.

The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a university in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the University College of The West Indies Faculty of Agriculture.

Libraries, etc.

There is a free public library in St. George's and branch libraries in each parish. In addition there is an island-wide book mobile service.

Health

A WHO Campaign for the eradication of *Aedes aegypti* has been in operation since 1953 and is well on the way to success. The mainland of Grenada has been negative since 1955 but Carriacou remains positive. A programme for the control of malaria which was incorporated in the 1953 programme for *aegypti* eradication was expanded in 1957 to a malaria eradication programme, leading to a decline in the incidence of the disease. There has been no case of malaria since March 1959 and the programme has now entered the surveillance stage.

The WHO-UNICEF also assisted with the B.C.G. campaign in 1954, with follow-up in 1955 and 1956 and subsequent incorporation of the programme into the normal activities of the Health Department; also with a scheme for the supplementary feeding of school children, expectant and nursing mothers.

In 1956 a treponematosis campaign was undertaken with the object of eradication of yaws and a reduction in the incidence of venereal diseases. Evaluation and surveillance which have been continuing since then have shown that yaws has been eradicated.

The Colony Hospital of 230 beds is at St. George's. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew's, is a modern building, recently constructed and provides 32 beds. The district hospital in Carriacou which was completely destroyed by the hurricane of 22nd September 1955 has been rebuilt and was opened on 16th July 1958. It has been named the Princess Royal Hospital.

There are 25 district Medical Visiting Stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Maternity and child welfare work is carried on in all these stations. There are three main Health Centres at St. George's, Goyave and St. David's, and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1960 amounted to $992,394 compared with $97,987 in 1935.

Communications

The airfield is at Pearls and has a runway 5,280 feet long by 150 feet wide. The Colony is served regionally by Leeward Islands Air Transport with a twice-weekly service and by British West Indian Airways with eighteen flights weekly; scheduled connections being available to North and South America and Europe.

There are approximately 476 miles of good roads divided into four classes: Class I—188½ miles, Class II—102½ miles, Class III—90½ miles, Class IV—94½ miles. About 256 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief port is St. George's which possesses a good harbour. Part of this harbour, called the inner harbour, is well sheltered with a deep-water pier 800 feet long and minimum draft of 30 feet alongside. The entrance to this inner harbour is through a channel 600 feet wide with a minimum depth of 45 feet. Other ports include Grenville and Hillsborough, Carriacou, but these are mostly used by small craft.

Regular cargo services are provided by Harrison Line Steamers and by vessels chartered by Geest Industries Limited from United Kingdom ports; by the Saguenay Shipping Company from Canadian ports; by the Booth and American Defence Lines from the United States ports and by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company from European ports. The Federal Shipping Service together with several small motor vessels, auxiliary and sailing vessels take care of the cargo services between the islands and also provide a useful passenger service.

Several foreign ships make frequent calls at this port to take immigrants to the United Kingdom. Passenger travel to the U.S.A. and Canada, however, has to be made through Trinidad or Barbados.

Total shipping for 1960 was 757 motor and steamships of 927,765 net registered tons, of which 364 ships of 268,249 net registered tons were British.

There were also 538 British sailing and auxiliary motor ships of 19,247 net registered tons.

Broadcasting

A Broadcasting Service for the Windward Islands, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, was inaugurated in 1955. Transmissions take place on short waves from a 5 kW transmitter and cover the Eastern Caribbean.
The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.

In 1955 a statutory body, the Grenada Banana Co-operative Society, was set up to control the production and marketing of bananas.

One farmers' society and eight fishermen's unions were registered under the Friendly Societies Ordinance in 1954.

A Co-operative Department was established in 1957. It now consists of a Registrar of Co-operatives, a Co-operatives Officer, a Junior Co-operatives Officer and two clerks. The Department is responsible for promotion work as well as registration, supervision and audit.

**History**

The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted for over a century and a half. When the riches of Mexico and Peru were opened up by the conquistadores, the Spaniards flocked to the mainland from the island colonies and Jamaica became little more than a supply base for expeditions to the mainland of America. The population, which had never been very great, dwindled to an insignificant and impoverished community which...
offered little resistance to the English invasion under Admiral Penn and General Venables in 1655. With this date the modern history of the Jamaican people may be said to begin. The last attempt to recover the island for Spain collapsed and the last remnant of the Spaniards left Jamaica from Runaway Bay in 1660. The Spaniards had imported slaves from Africa, most of whom they took with them, but a small number remained in the mountains of the interior and formed the nucleus of the Maroons. Of the present community, the founders and pioneers were colonists who came from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland in the seventeenth century.

**Constitution**

The Jamaica (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, came into operation on the 4th July 1959. Jamaica then became self-governing in its internal affairs, although its position as a unit territory of the Federation of The West Indies remained unchanged.

The new constitution includes provision for a Privy Council, a Cabinet, a Legislative Council and a House of Representatives.

The Privy Council consists of six members. It advises the Governor in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Government Service and in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.

The Cabinet consists of the Premier and not less than eleven other Ministers charged with the general control and direction of the Government. Two or three Ministers without Portfolio sit in the Legislative Council. The other Ministers sit in the House of Representatives. The Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Legislature. The Governor appoints as Premier the member of the House of Representatives best able to command the confidence of the majority of members of that Chamber and the remaining Ministers are appointed on the advice of the Premier. The Governor is required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, except where the matter is the responsibility of some other body (e.g. the Public Service Commission) or where the constitution specifically provides for him to act in his discretion.

The Legislature consists of the Governor (acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen), the Legislative Council and the House of Representatives.

The Legislative Council consists of eighteen members appointed by the Governor after consultation with persons speaking for the differing political points of view of groups represented in the House of Representatives, and two or three members nominated by the Premier. The Legislative Council is essentially a revisionary Chamber with powers to delay bills against the wishes of the House for a limited period of time only.

The House of Representatives consists of forty-five members elected by universal adult suffrage. The constitution includes provision for the number of members to be varied between forty-five and sixty.

The constitution establishes Judicial Service, Public Service and Police Service Commissions with executive responsibility for appointments, discipline and dismissals in the Services for which they are responsible. Officers in the Public Service and Police Service against whom disciplinary action is taken may appeal to the Privy Council. Judicial officers will have no right of appeal to the Privy Council but a Judge may be removed from office only if the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom recommends that he should be removed for inability or misbehaviour after the matter has first been investigated by a locally appointed Judicial tribunal.

Following the Referendum in September 1961 which resulted in a majority vote in favour of Jamaica withdrawing from the Federation, it was agreed that legislation would be enacted, if possible by the end of March 1962, to enable this to be done and that Jamaica should become independent as early as practicable in 1962. The 6th August 1962 was subsequently agreed as the date for independence. (Cmnd. 1638).

**Land Policy**

Appreciable areas of privately owned land have been acquired by Government and disposed of under the existing Land Settlement Scheme, which is a freehold system of tenure. Crown lands (with the exception of Forest Reserves) are also available for purchase by private individuals. A few properties formerly operated on a leasehold system have now been converted to freehold properties.

**Taxation**

The main heads of direct taxation are: Income tax, land and property tax, estate duties and licence duty on motor vehicles. Taxes on real property are collected on the basis of improved value, but by the end of the previous financial year revaluation on the basis of unimproved value was completed in two parishes as part of a general scheme to place taxation on the unimproved value.

Indirect taxation comprises Customs duties, excise duties, entertainment duties and certain licences and fees. Essential foodstuffs are either free of Customs duty or assessed at low rates. Several industries are granted duty-free admission of building materials, plant and equipment, under special incentive legislation, and industrial raw material is, in most cases, admissible duty free.

The Bank of Jamaica, which will operate as a central bank, came into being under the Bank of Jamaica Law, 32 of 1960, during which year legislation was also instituted to initiate some control over the activities of the Commercial Banks.

Education

The University College of the West Indies at Mona, near Kingston, has faculties of Medicine, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences and Arts and Departments of Education and Public Administration. There are now faculties of Agriculture and Engineering at St. Augustine, Trinidad. The total student enrolment for the academic year 1960-61 was 977 of whom 327 were Jamaicans. Technical education is available at the Kingston Technical School, which in July 1960 had 580 day students and 1,068 evening students, and the College of Arts, Science and Technology which in July 1960 had 107 day students and 123 evening students. The Ministry of Education awarded 65 Scholarships for higher education in 1959 tenable at the University College of the West Indies and at institutions abroad. A number of other scholarships are offered both by other branches of Government and by individuals and non-Governmental institutions.

In 1960 there were 41 government grant-aided secondary schools with an enrolment of 16,258 and 718 primary schools with an enrolment of 263,642.

Expenditure on Education in 1960-61 was £5,163,438. In 1935 the expenditure was £226,392. The 1961-62 Estimates make provision for the expenditure of £6,696,600 on Education.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Jamaica Library Service operates a free Public Library Service for the Island. It is entirely financed by Government and is organized through a headquarters in Kingston, 13 Parish Libraries, 6 Branch Libraries, 118 Book centres and 7 Bookmobile service points.

The total number of registered readers is 121,884 and the bookstock numbers 299,448 volumes. This bookstock is available to all readers through the use of a Union Catalogue maintained at Headquarters.

A Schools Library Service organized in conjunction with the Ministry of Education supplies 723 Schools with books on a circulating basis. Three book-mobiles now serve 444 of these schools.

The Institute of Jamaica, a cultural centre of the Island, includes a general Lending and Reference Library, a West India Reference Library, two Junior Centres, the Jamaica School of Arts and Crafts and a Museum with galleries for natural history and the exhibition of arts and crafts. Extensive study collections are being developed in all branches of Jamaican history and West Indian natural history.

Health

During 1960-61 Central Government spent approximately £3,499,371 on its medical services, which was offset by appropriation in aid amounting to £18,519. This figure excludes expenditure from the Sweepstake Fund, the cost of maintenance and construction of buildings and the cost of operating the Bellevue (Mental) Hospital. Expenditure in 1935 amounted to £191,207.

Disease rates compare favourably with more advanced countries nearby, e.g. the United States of America and Canada. Among the colony's main diseases are: helminthiasis, yaws, malaria, venereal diseases and pulmonary tuberculosis. There were mild outbreaks of diphtheria and poliomyelitis during 1960.

Each of the Island's 14 parishes has a full-time Medical Officer (Health), in charge of public health services, and a staff of public health inspectors, public health and district nurses. In the head office in Kingston are specialist officers who are responsible for the various phases of public health activities, which include epidemiology, health education, quarantine, public health nursing and control work in tuberculosis, venereal diseases, yaws, malaria and industrial health.
The following are the government hospitals and bed capacity in Jamaica:

- 21 general hospitals (2,774).
- Victoria Jubilee Maternity Hospital (160).
- George V Memorial Sanatorium for chest diseases (228).
- Tuberculosis Hospital (180).
- Bellevue (Mental) Hospital (3,115).
- Hansen Home for the treatment of leprosy (188).

There are altogether 140 health centres and dispensaries. The figure for out-patient attendance during Calendar year 1959 was approximately 960,270.

The University College Hospital of the West Indies provides accommodation for 300 in-patients. It is proposed to increase the bed accommodation to 454. There are large Casualty and Out-patient Clinics.

A four-year Malaria Eradication Programme commenced in January 1958.

Communications

The international airports are at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. Government-owned internal airstrips are provided at Boscobel and Braco and there are twelve private airstrips in the Island. Completely new Airports have been built at Palisadoes and Montego Bay. The new terminal building at Montego Bay has been completed and the runway has been resurfaced. At Palisadoes the new 7,600 ft. runway 11/29 is now in use and the construction of the new terminal building was completed in 1961. Both airports will be able to accommodate the largest commercial aircraft to be put into service in the foreseeable future.

Palisadoes Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Trans-Canada Air Lines, Avianca Airlines, Aerovias Panama and numerous non-scheduled operators.

Montego Bay Airport is used by B.O.A.C., Pan American World Airways, British West Indian Airways, Avianca Airlines, Delta Airlines, Avensa Airlines and Trans-Canada Air Lines.

Meteorological services are provided by The West Indies Meteorological Service, air traffic and associated services by the Civil Aviation Department and aeronautical telecommunications facilities and radio aids to navigation by International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited.

The railway, operated by the Jamaica Railway Corporation, has a total track mileage of 249. During the financial year 1960-61 revenue reached a total sum of £960,179. Expenditure (including interest charges) amounted to £1,105,173. The line stretches from Kingston to Montego Bay and to Port Antonio, with branch lines to Frankfield and to Linstead.

The Island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring; the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the Island there are many bridges, culverts and sharp turns; the maximum gradients are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,668 miles of main road in the Island, maintained by the Ministry of Communications and Works. There are also 6,205 miles of parochial roads, of which 3,234 miles are suitable for light motor traffic.

The principal ports are Kingston, Montego Bay and Port Antonio. Regular cargo and passenger services are maintained with the United Kingdom by Harrison Lines, Elders and Fyffes, the Jamaica Banana Producers' Association, the Royal Mail Lines, the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, the Sitmar Line and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company; with Canada by the Canada-Jamaica Line and Saguenay Terminals Limited; with the United States of America by the United Fruit Company, the Alcoa Steamship Company, the Three Bays Line and the Eastern Shipping Corporation; with the other British West Indian Islands by the S.S. Kirkdale and S.S. Herman Langreder operated by the Federal Government of The West Indies and Three Bays Line; with Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Bremen and Antwerp by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company; and with South America and Europe by Fratelli Grimaldi Line and Sicular Oceanic Lines; with India, Ceylon, Cape Town, Durban and Mauritius by the Nourse Line (service temporarily withdrawn); with Australia and New Zealand by the New Zealand Shipping Company, Port Line, Shaw Savill and Albion Company and Ellerman, Bucknall Company Limited; with the Far East (Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines) by the de-la-Rama Steamship Lines. Bulk cargoes of petroleum products are imported from Trinidad and Aruba. During 1960 incoming cargo was estimated at 1,562,527 tons and outgoing at 6,372,443 tons.

Broadcasting

Radio Jamaica Limited (R.J.R.) operates a 19-hour a day commercial broadcasting service for the Island using medium wave and frequency modulation with a power of 5,000 watts. The Company also operates a wired broadcasting service in urban and suburban Kingston and in certain rural areas. An extra hour is transmitted daily to the latter subscribers. The Company makes available to the Government of Jamaica 7½ hours of broadcasting time per week and relays several hours per week from the B.B.C.

The Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (J.B.C.) is a publicly owned Corporation set up by the Government of Jamaica in January 1959. The Corporation started broadcasting on 14th June 1959 with a schedule of 19 hours a day. To establish the station the sum of £300,000 was made available by the Government. The Corporation's transmitting facilities are identical with those of R.J.R. Four 5,000 watt transmitters are used in the standard broadcast band, situated at Kingston, Mandeville, Montego Bay and Port Maria, the transmitters being linked by two 500 watt FM transmitters—one at Kingston and the other at Christiana. The Corporation maintains a short-wave receiving station at Wareika Hill, and uses a large number of short-wave relays and transcriptions. The Corporation is run on lines similar to that of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the British Broadcasting Corporation, except that unlike the B.B.C. it sells advertising time and is expected, after an initial period, to pay its own way from commercial revenues. The Corporation also makes 7½ hours per week available to the Government.

The number of radio receivers in Jamaica was estimated (April 1961) to be 150,000; the number of "rediffusion" subscribers was estimated (September 1961) to be approximately 15,000.
Principal Occupations

The active labour force in 1957 classified by Industrial Groups was:

- Agriculture, Quarrying, Mining, Fishing, Hunting and Forestry: 338,000
- Manufacturing: 88,000
- Electricity, Gas, Water and Sanitary: 3,000
- Construction: 41,000
- Transportation, Communication and Storage: 17,000
- Finance and Commerce: 70,000
- Services (Professional, Business, Recreational and Personal): 130,000

Total: 687,000

The industrial development of the Island is stimulated by the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Law, Cap. 294, the Export Industry Encouragement Law, 1956, and the Industrial Incentives Law, 1956. Under these Laws, approved manufacturers are allowed certain privileges such as income tax holidays and the duty-free importation of plant and equipment.

In 1960 the number of registered unions was 32 with a total membership of over 187,000. The National Workers Union and the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union had memberships of over 75,000.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products are rum, sugar, bananas, citrus, tobacco, pimento and coffee. In 1960 20 factories processed 4,385,000 tons of sugar cane to produce 424,270 tons of sugar. Rum production was 2,368,000 gallons.

Also manufactured in the Island are cans, paint, corrugated cardboard cartons, metal furniture, beer, aerated waters, confectionery, cocoa products, building blocks, panels and boards, wire bound box shocks, sanitary spoons, electrical equipment, acid filled accumulators, gypsum products, carbon dioxide gas, jelly crystals, metal containers, plastic products, pre-stressed and post-stressed concrete products, ice cream cones, drinking straws, acetylene, hollow ware, phonograph records and metal awnings.

Jamaica is the largest exporter of bauxite in the world. The deposits are worked by one Canadian and two American companies, the Canadian company processing bauxite into alumina. It was announced in May 1960 that another American company which had already been prospecting in the Island would start full-scale mining operations, probably in 1963. Gypsum production in 1960 was 246,000 tons and cement production 209,000 tons.

Under the Coffee Industry Regulation Law, Cap. 64, and the Cocoa Industry Board Law (Law 21 of 1957), the Coffee Industry Board and the Cocoa Industry Board were appointed on the 2nd June 1950 and the 1st August 1957, respectively. These Boards are given wide statutory powers to regulate and develop these industries.

The Exports Division of the Marketing Department is the sole exporter of pimento.

The Sugar Manufacturers’ Association (comprising all the sugar manufacturers in Jamaica) provides the liaison between the sugar industry, the Government of Jamaica and overseas interests. It deals with all aspects of the sugar industry, and sells co-operatively sugar for local consumption and all rum and other by-products.

As far as exports are concerned, during the war and up to 1952 when the British Ministry of Food purchased the entire exportable surplus, the Sugar Manufacturers’ Association acted for the entire industry. The position now is that under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement of 21st December 1951 Jamaica is entitled from that year onwards, to a Global Quota, divided into a Negotiated Price Quota and a Free Quota. The former is now sold (as from 1st January 1957) to the Sugar Board, set up under the United Kingdom Sugar Act, 1956, at prices annually negotiated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The latter is disposed of through commercial channels, as in the years before the war. There is also a small International Quota which is disposed of through commercial channels.

Through its subsidiaries, the Sugar Manufacturers’ Association maintains substantial interests in firms engaged in the manufacture of commodities ancillary to the sugar industry, e.g.:

- Wholly owned subsidiaries—Shareholders in Jamaica Carbonics, Ltd.; Anhydrous Alcohol, Ltd.
- Minority shareholders in Jamaica Oxygen and Acetylene, Ltd.

The Citrus Growers’ Association has full responsibility for the industry, and is the sole exporter of citrus, which is marketed co-operatively for its members. It operates two processing plants and two packing houses which, together with independent processors and packers, obtain quotas of fresh fruits for packing and canning. These arrangements do not include limes, lemons and ugils.

The Banana Board was appointed on 1st October 1953 under the Banana Board Law (Law 24 of 1953). The Board is the sole exporter of bananas and has wide powers over the industry.

On the 31st December 1960 there were 224 co-operative societies with 69,502 members and total share capital of £1,074,179 registered under the Co-operative Societies Law. Of these 106 were Thrift and Loan Societies, 17 Consumer Societies, 16 Fishermen Societies, 8 Transport and Tillage Societies, 57 Marketing and Credit Societies, 2 Co-operative Farming Societies, 3 Co-operative Land Purchase/Land Lease Societies, 4 Irrigation Societies, 1 Housing Society, 1 Cultural Society, 1 Cattle Insurance Society, 5 Secondary (Federation) Societies and 1 Tertiary Society.

Total loans granted by all Societies during the year amounted to £1,023,012; the total recovered was £812,939; the value of produce marketed through marketing societies during the year was £384,204.

Montserrat

Area and Geographical Features

The area of the island is about 32 square miles. It is entirely volcanic, very mountainous and comprises three main hill masses—Silver Hill in the north (1,285 feet), Central Hills (2,450 feet) and Soufriere Hills (Chance Peak 3,002 feet) in the south. Forest and woodland cover about 10 square miles in the two main ranges and streams are plentiful. The northern hills, however, are almost without trees and in that part of the island there is little cultivation.

Population

The population at the 1960 census numbered 12,157.

Principal Town

Plymouth, the only town, has a population of 2,500.

History

The island was colonized in 1632 when a number of Irishmen of Sir Thomas Warner's company made their homes there. It was captured by the French in 1667, restored to England at the Peace of Breda later in the same year, capitulated to the French again in 1782 and was finally ceded to Britain in 1783.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 175) except for the following differences:

(i) In Executive Council there are four unofficial members (including the Chief Minister and two other Ministers) and two official members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary). These three Ministers are appointed from the elected members of the Legislative Council.

(ii) The present composition of the Legislative Council is the Administrator, who presides, two official members, one nominated unofficial member and seven elected members.

(iii) Montserrat shares a joint Police Force with Antigua and the Virgin Islands. The head of this joint Force is appointed by the Administrator of Antigua acting in his discretion and gazetted ranks of the Force are appointed by the Administrator of Antigua after consultation with the Police Service Commission.

Land Policy

Crown land comprises the Government Land Settlement, where occupation is confined to an annual lease, and a small area acquired for public purposes. All other land is privately owned.

Taxation

The following forms of direct taxation are in force:

Income Tax (ranging from 6d. to 15s. per £ of chargeable income; companies 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income).

St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla

Area and Geographical Features

The total area of the Colony is 138 square miles (St. Kitts 65, Nevis 36, Anguilla 35 and Sombrero 2 square miles). St. Kitts has a range of lofty mountains traversing its central part (Mount Misery 3,711 feet). Nevis is nearly circular in shape with a central mountain rising to 3,596 feet. Both islands are of volcanic origin. Anguilla is flat and composed of oligocene limestone and clay. Sombrero is a rocky islet. Hot mineral springs with valuable medicinal properties are to be found near Charlestown, Nevis.

Population

The preliminary figure of population at the 1960 Census was 56,684.

Principal Towns

Basseterre, the capital of St. Kitts, has a population of approximately 15,742, and Charlestown and its environs, the capital of Nevis, has a population of approximately 2,850.

History

St. Christopher, discovered by Columbus on his second voyage in 1493, was the first island in the West Indies to be colonized by the English, when Sir Thomas Warner took settlers there in 1623. In 1624 the French, under d'Esnambuc, also colonized one-half of the island.

After a severe battle with the Europeans in about 1626, the Caribs, the native people of the island, were driven out in 1629.

Intermittent warfare between the French and British settlers during the seventeenth century ravaged the economy of the island. It was, however, ceded to Britain by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The last fighting on the island took place in 1782 when the French captured Brimstone Hill after a memorable siege and once more took possession of St. Christopher. The island was finally restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis, also sighted by Columbus on his second voyage, was settled by the English in 1628 and soon became one of the most prosperous of the Antilles. Although it suffered from French and Spanish attacks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it maintained a sound economic position until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Columbus probably also first sighted Anguilla. The island remained continuously British after its colonization in 1650 but was subject in its early days to severe depredations by marauders, free-booters and pirates.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua (see page 175) except that there is a separate Police Force. The Administrator appoints the Head of the Force in his discretion and the gazetted ranks after consulting the Police Service Commission.

Land Policy

Aliens cannot own land except under licence from the Governor.

Taxation

The main taxes in force are Customs duty and Income tax. Income tax rates range from 6d. in the £ to 15s. in the £ upon the chargeable income of an individual. Companies pay a flat rate of 8s. in the £.

Development Plans

The Five-Year Development Plan which was drawn up in 1955 for the period 1955–60 was further revised in 1959. The new plan envisaged expenditure of $5,966,000 over the five year period; of this sum $2,751,000 came from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, $768,000 from local revenue, $2,447,000 from local and external loans. The Development funds were allocated as follows: Trade and Production $582,000, Social Services $629,000 and Communications and Works $4,755,000.

A new Five-Year Development Plan was approved for the period 1960–65. This envisaged expenditure to a total of $7,376,350, of which $4,426,350 will come from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and $2,950,000 from loans. The funds have been allocated as follows: Industrial and Area Development $2,249,500, Agri-
Agriculture, Veterinary and Fisheries $1,411,500,
Communications and Works $1,367,129, Social Services $2,320,416 and Administrative $27,805.

Education

In 1960 there were 35 Government primary schools (St. Kitts 19, Nevis 11, Anguilla 5), four private primary schools in St. Kitts which receive Government grants and nine unaided primary schools. The total enrolment was 23,189. Five secondary schools (Government 4, private 1) had an enrolment of more than 1,200 pupils.

Health

The total expenditure on medical and health services in 1960 was $814,353 compared with $96,864 in 1938. In 1960, beds available in two general hospitals totalled 157, those in two cottage hospitals 40. There were 24 Health Centres and Outposts at work in the Colony. Their chief functions are to improve standards of nutrition, to promote maternal and child health, to improve environmental sanitation, to control tuberculosis, venereal disease and yaws and to educate the community in health matters. There are also a tuberculosis ward and a leprosarium.

Communications

One airport, about two miles north of Basseterre by road, serves the island of St. Kitts. The runway is 4,125 feet by 300 feet and lies in a west-east direction. This is being extended and a new terminal building and control tower are being constructed.

There are landing strips with terminal buildings in Nevis and Anguilla. The air service to these islands is operated by L.I.A.T., a subsidiary of B.W.I.A.

Under a Colonial Development and Welfare grant a new passenger service vessel was built in British Guiana for daily voyages between St. Kitts and Nevis and put into operation in 1959. It replaces the one destroyed by hurricane in 1956.

Broadcasting

There is a Government owned broadcasting station situated in St. Kitts which broadcasts on 570 k/cs.

Principal Occupations

The staple industry is sugar and about 7,600 persons are employed on estates or in the sugar factory at Basseterre. In Nevis there is a high percentage of peasant ownership of land and apart from the cultivation of sugar cane, sea island cotton of good quality is grown in large quantities for export. In Anguilla, where the majority of the inhabitants are peasant proprietors, the main industries are livestock raising, salt production and fishing.

St. Lucia

Area and Population

According to recent aerial surveys, the area is about 238 square miles. The population at the 1960 Census was 88,108.

Principal Towns

| Town          | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| Castries      | 17,505     |
| Soufrière     | 2,723      |
| Vieux Fort    | 3,226      |

Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September—October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

History

Neither the date of discovery, nor the discoverer, of St. Lucia is known, for according to the evidence of Columbus's voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrees, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.

In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June 1803 was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua—(see page 175).
Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from 6d. in every £ of the first £100, to 13s. in the £ above £5,000. Companies pay 6s. 8d. in the £ on their chargeable income.

| 1960 | 7,437,039  | 7,825,682       |

In 1960 36·0% of revenue was derived from Customs and Excise duties and 10·8% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: $1,646,104
- Administration: $288,989
- Public Works: $1,066,553
- Development: $1,317,091

The Public Debt of the Colony at 31st December 1960 stood at $5,755,582 which includes $3,030,096 loaned for Castries and Soufrière Reconstruction, plus Economic Loan of $2,006,400. The accumulated Sinking Funds towards its redemption stood at $1,579,947.

Currency (see under Antigua—page 175).

Development Plans

During 1961 schemes totalling $2,100,561 (£437,617) were approved under the C.D.& W. Development Programme 1960–64. These schemes fell under the following heads:

| Head          | Amount ($) | Amount (£)   |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Administration| 59,098     | (12,312)    |
| Production    | 790,834    | (164,757)   |
| Communications| 646,526    | (134,693)   |
| Social Services| 604,104   | (125,855)   |

In addition, the United States Government made the following amounts available to the Government of St. Lucia under the Joint Statement on Economic and Technical Assistance which was signed between the two Governments in St. Lucia at the end of the United States Bases Talks (Stage II) on 10th December 1960:

- Roads: $150,000 U.S. Currency
- Secondary School: $100,000 U.S. Currency
- Rural Development: $200,000 U.S. Currency

Education

There are two secondary schools with 860 pupils on roll and fifty-two primary and infant schools which cater for pupils from 4 to 15 years of age. The number of children on roll in these schools is 19,918. Adult education is provided by the Extra Mural Department of the U.C.W.I. and by organised voluntary groups. Community education centres provide facilities whereby the people of the area can meet to discuss matters of common interest and to take part in recreational activities.

An Adult Education Officer attached to the Education Department was appointed in 1960 and her duties include: (a) The organisation of classes and courses suited to the ability, interest and needs of adults; (b) the co-ordination of existing services providing adult education in the community.

The total expenditure for 1960 was $726,759, compared with $32,122 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a Central Library in Castries and a branch library in Soufrière. Small branches are also maintained in the towns and villages.

Health

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases and venereal diseases.

Malaria has been virtually eradicated as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

A five-year Environmental Sanitation Programme was started in 1959 with assistance from W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. The aim of the programme is to provide safe excreta disposal systems and water supplies in all rural areas of the Island.

Available hospital beds amount to 158 general, 50 tuberculosis, 140 in the mental hospital and 120 in a home for the aged and infirm.

In 1959 hospital in-patients numbered 6,421. Due to a shortage of medical staff in 1959 records in respect of persons attended at clinics or health out-posts are not considered to be reliable. The number of such persons in 1958 was 67,761.

Communications

There are two airfields in St. Lucia—Vigie Airport and Beane Field Airport. Vigie Airport is owned and operated by the Government of St. Lucia for scheduled and charter services while Beane Field is owned by the Government of the United States of America. By agreement with the Government of the United States of America, Beane Field may be used for any service when it becomes expedient to do so.

Air services with other territories are maintained by British West Indian Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport. The former Company is owned by the Trinidad Government and the latter is a subsidiary of B.W.I.A. Charter services are undertaken by these companies, principally between the Units of the West Indian Federation. Migrant and tourist charter flights are undertaken by various companies.

The runway at Vigie Airport was lengthened from 4,500 feet to 5,700 feet. This work was completed in 1960.

The total mileage of the island’s road system is 401.

The island is served by the following main Shipping Lines from Europe:

- Harrison Lines—Cargo Vessels.
- Geest Industries—Cargo and Passenger Vessels.
- French Lines—Passenger Vessels.
- Italian Lines—Passenger Vessels.

Numerous Inter-island Craft are the main means of communication with neighbouring islands. During 1960 444 vessels called at St. Lucia. Gross tonnage handled was 1,123,379.

**St. Vincent**

**Area**

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

**Population**

The population at the 1960 (April) Census was 80,042.
Principal Town

Kingstown, the capital, has a population of 15,981.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufrière (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 70 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At the Kingstown station, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 82·7° and the rainfall 73·68 inches, in 1960.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent, and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British fourteen years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 175) except that provision is made for nine elected members in the Legislative Council.

Taxation

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 65 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 37½ cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 18s. 2d. per proof gallon.

- Medical: $719,315
- Education: $773,011

The Public Debt at 31st December 1960 was $484,267, equivalent to $6·05 per head of the population.

Currency (see under Antigua—page 175).

Development Plans

St. Vincent has been allocated the sum of £540,000 ($2,592,000) under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. It is proposed that these funds should be used as follows in the 1960–64 period:

| Item                          | Amount |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture, etc.             | £156,273 |

| Urban and Rural Rehabilitation| £17,268 |
| **Total**                     | **£540,000** |

Education

In 1960 there were two Government secondary schools and two grant-aided secondary schools with an enrolment of 905 pupils and 54 primary schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 20,937 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Four Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 176 pupils.

During 1959–60 some 45 St. Vincent students were attending universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1960 expenditure on educational services amounted to $865,848. The contribution of the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $90,657. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

Health

Yaws is no longer a public health problem, prompt measures are taken to control individual cases and any sporadic outbreaks. The work of arresting the spread of Tuberculosis progressed with intensified contact finding and follow-up of cured cases. Tuberculin testing and B.C.G. Vaccination of school children in certain age groups were continued. Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 24 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery): 210
- Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases: 48
- Mental: 100
- Leprosy: 20
- Pauper Home: 125

In 1960 in-patients numbered 4,597; out-patients, 4,517.

Total expenditure in 1960 on Government Health and Medical Services was $719,315; in 1935 $66,945.
Communications

The Seadrome at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown, is no longer in use. An airstrip has been constructed at Arnos Vale, two miles outside Kingstown. The terminal building was in use at the end of October 1961. British West Indian Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport are operating services daily in and out of Arnos Vale Airport.

There are about 602 miles of road of which some 396 miles are motorable throughout the year; 136 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 259 miles of metalled roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A fortnightly cargo and passenger service is provided by two Federal ships travelling alternately via the islands as far north as Jamaica and south to Trinidad. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service monthly by the Harrison Line. Geest Industries Steamships call weekly taking shipments of bananas to the United Kingdom. The Saguenay Line's steamships call southbound from Canada via the islands fortnightly and return approximately every four weeks northbound. The Royal Netherlands Steamship Company operates a cargo service once monthly, northbound. Motor vessels and schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Principal Occupations

The working population is estimated to be some 32,000, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

Trade Unions

| Member-ship |
|-------------|
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers' Union | 2,780 |
| The Civil Service Association | 159 |
| The Teachers' Association | 375 |
| The Secondary School Teachers' Association | 31 |
| United Workers' Union | 415 |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops in order of importance are bananas, arrowroot, copra, sugar, cotton, sweet potatoes, nutmegs and mace, peanuts, starchy food crops, cocoa and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 12,000; cattle 7,000; sheep 14,000; horses and mules 200; swine 10,000.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

Extensive fishing is done in-shore but very little off-shore. A fisheries scheme has just been approved under which cold storage facilities will be provided. This, it is hoped, will lead to greatly increased activity particularly in the well stocked fishing waters of the Grenadines.

The one modern Central Arrowroot Factory is now operating. There are some 28 other privately owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a cigarette factory; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks. The Government Cotton Gininery was destroyed by fire in November 1959 and has not yet been rebuilt. There is a tyre recapping factory at Arnos Vale.

In 1938 43% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 36% from other Commonwealth countries and 21% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1960 were: 38, 32 and 30.

In 1938 40% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 22% to other Commonwealth countries and 38% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1960 were: 54, 31 and 15.

Principal Exports by Quantity and Value ($ B.W.I.)

| Item          | 1938 | 1959 | 1960 |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| Bananas       | 1,300| 24,127| 22,669|
| Arrowroot     | 3,651| 3,637| 3,129|

| Sugar         | —    | 1,050| 500  |
| Sweet Potatoes| —    | 2,861| 2,366|

The chief imports are foodstuffs, cotton piecegoods, cement, timber, motor spirit, fertilisers and motor vehicles.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

At the end of 1960 there were 14 registered Co-operative Societies with a membership of 1,298 classified as follows: 7 Credit Unions, 2 Marketing and Processing Societies, 4 Fishermen's Societies and 1 Thrift and Credit. These societies have savings amounting to $31,180 and assets totalling $45,113. Loans granted to members during 1960 amounted to $21,307 and repayments totalled $13,497.

The impact of these societies on the economic life of the people is gradually being felt and it is hoped that with increased co-operative education and techniques greater economic and social improvements will result.

The 26 Agricultural Credit Societies which operate under the Agricultural Credit Societies Ordinance cater solely for peasant farmers. Membership at the end of 1960 totalled 1,281 and loans granted amounted to $43,915.

A Statutory Marketing Board has been established to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchasing, handling, storage, exportation, shipping and marketing of all specified produce of St. Vincent, provided that this shall not apply to produce, the marketing of which is already under the control of some other Statutory Authority. At present under the provisions of the Marketing Board Ordinance, 1959, only sweet potatoes have been declared a "specified product". The Board will eventually
deal with the majority of crops but it is proposed to proceed cautiously, making a start with sweet potatoes only, and "specifying" other items gradually in the light of experience.

Trinidad and Tobago

Area

The total area of the territory is 1,980 square miles (Trinidad 1,864, Tobago 116).

Population

The population at the census held in April 1960 was 819,399. The majority are natives of the West Indies, of African and East Indian descent. English is spoken generally throughout the territory.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|-----------|
| Port of Spain (capital) | 91,596 |
| San Fernando | 38,587 |
| Arima | 10,941 |

Geographical Features

Trinidad is traversed by two mountain ranges, the northern and southern ranges, running roughly east and west, and a third, the central range, running diagonally across the island. Between the northern and central ranges the land is flat and well-watered; south of the central range it is undulating and the water supply poor. Apart from a comparatively small area in the northern range (main peaks: Cerro del Aripo 3,085 feet, El Tucuche 3,072 feet) and Mount Tamana (1,009 feet) in the central range, all the land is below 1,000 feet. The rivers, though numerous, are unimportant. A main ridge of hills, 18 miles in length, extends nearly two-thirds of the length of Tobago from its north-eastern extremity. The highest point is 1,890 feet. About 300,000 acres, or 22% of the total area of the territory, is under forest.

Climate

The climate is tropical. There is a dry season from January to the middle of May with an average rainfall of 3·8-5·2 inches per month and a wet season from June to December (with a short break in September) with an average of 5·7-11·4 inches per month. The average annual rainfall ranges from 68 inches in the west to 97 inches in the east. The mean temperature in 1958 was 82·1°F. The coolest months of the year are December to April.

History

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on his third voyage in 1498 and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalized his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant in 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of representations made to the Court of Madrid as to its exceptional fertility, a royal proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to Catholics of all
nations to settle in Trinidad. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, soon augmented by many French families driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the events of the French Revolution; and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

In 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces. In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

Tobago was also discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the Darling and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when some 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walchern. After a residence of a year or two these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsius procured letters patent from Louis XIV creating him Baron of Tobago and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral D'Estrées to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis XIV restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1682, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral, the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to Great Britain in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. In 1793 it was captured by a British force and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802; again reconquered in 1803 by a British force; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad in 1888 and in 1898 became a ward of the united colony of Trinidad and Tobago.

Constitution

A new Constitution by which Trinidad and Tobago achieved full internal self-government was brought fully into operation on 19th December 1961. It makes provision for a Governor, a bicameral legislature composed of a Senate and a House of Representatives, an executive, a judiciary and Commissions dealing with the Public Service, the Police Service and the Judicial and Legal Service. Provision is also made for the establishment of a Boundaries Commission.

The Governor is divested of his previous reserved executive powers, although he will continue to act in his discretion in certain matters after consultation, in some cases, with the Premier. The power of disallowance is now limited to legislation which affects to their disadvantage the rights of the holders of Trinidad Government Stock. The Governor must reserve Bills affecting Her Majesty's Government's international obligations and the Royal prerogative.

The House of Representatives consists of 30 Members elected in single member constituencies. The Speaker may be elected from among the non-Ministerial members of the House or from outside the legislature. The Senate consists of 21 Members, of which 12 are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier, 2 on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and 7 at the Governor's discretion, after consultation with persons representing special interests.

The Cabinet which is the principal instrument of policy includes the Premier (the Governor appoints in his discretion the leader of the party which commands the support of the majority of the members of the House of Representatives) and not more than 11 other Ministers appointed by the Governor on the Premier's advice. In the present Cabinet, 9 members have been charged with the administration of the following subjects: Home Affairs; Health and Housing; Agriculture; Industry and Commerce; Works; Public Utilities; Labour; Finance; Local Government and Community Development and Education. The three other members are the Premier, the Attorney-General and a Minister without Portfolio, who is Special Adviser to the Premier. Seven Parliamentary Secretaries have also been appointed.

Since 1946 elections have been on the basis of universal adult suffrage. In the last which were held on 4th December 1961 the People's National Movement won 20 seats polling 58% of the total votes cast and the Democratic Labour Party 10 seats, polling 39·7% of the total votes cast.

Land Policy

Policy with regard to land in the territory was modified in 1941 when the sale of Crown lands was discontinued. Leases are now granted with covenants designed to assure full and proper development of the land. The period for which leases for agricultural purposes are granted is 25 years, with an option to renew for a further 25 years. The leases also contain provision for compensating the lessees for unexhausted improvements and for penalties for dilapidation of Government-owned buildings. Land may be compulsorily acquired by the Crown for public purposes subject to the payment of compensation.

Taxation

Under the Customs tariff taxation takes the form of specific and ad valorem duties, with British and general tariff rates. There is also an export duty on asphalt of $1·20 per ton (crude), $1·66 per ton (refined) and $1·20 per ton on asphalt cement. Excise duties are levied on petrol (18 cents per imperial gallon), beer, notable spirits and
spirituous preparations, deodorized edible oil, lard substitute, matches and liquefied gases (propane and butane).

Under the Income Tax Ordinance the income of a resident individual which exceeds the allowances to which he is entitled is taxed at rates varying from 6 cents in every dollar of the first $1,000 to 90 cents in every dollar of income in excess of $66,000. The deductible allowances are (a) personal $1,200, (b) wife $480 ($720 if she is employed and receives emoluments totalling $240 or over), (c) child $240 or (if the child is educated in the territory but away from home) actual expenses for board and lodging and tuition not exceeding $960, or (if the child is educated abroad) actual expenses not exceeding $1,200, (d) dependent relative $200, (e) house-keeper $200, (f) insurance premiums not exceeding one-sixth of income. Life assurance companies are taxed at 15% of their profits and other companies at 40%. Other main heads of taxation include estate duties, lands and buildings taxes, a sweepstake tax, a pool betting tax, a cinema entertainment tax and a motor vehicle purchase tax.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1956 | $88,468,218 | $86,203,270 |
| 1957 | $101,610,027 | $90,158,952 |
| 1958 | $130,031,962 | $128,419,044 |

| 1960 | $162,386,516 | $156,434,340 |

In 1960 $56,644,988 of revenue was derived from Income Tax and $43,300,925 from Customs and Excise duties—(estimated figures).

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

| Head                  | Amount   |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Education             | $17,160,730 |
| Health                | $16,764,039 |
| Works (extraordinary and annually recurrent) | $8,694,177 |
| Police                | $6,575,675 |
| Public Debt (charges) | $6,145,388 |
| Home Affairs          | $9,472,443 |

### Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group), on behalf of Barbados, British Guiana, Leeward Islands, Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago. It consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100 denominations and British Caribbean coins of ½ cent, 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents and 50 cents denominations. United Kingdom silver and bronze coins, however, remain legal tender until demonetized. Currency notes issued by the Government of Jamaica are legal tender in the Eastern Group of British Caribbean Territories and currency notes issued by the Currency Board of the Eastern Group of Territories are similarly legal tender in Jamaica. The total value of currency notes in circulation in Trinidad and Tobago at the end of 1960 amounted to $32,678,527 and the total value of British Caribbean coin amounted to $1,984,021, at the rate of $1 for 4s. 2d.

### Development Plans

Trinidad and Tobago received an allocation of $4,800,000 under the Development and Welfare Act of 1945, as a contribution towards a development plan. The estimated unallocated balance of this sum at 31st December 1955 was $2,171,515. The Secretary of State agreed to make this balance available during the life of the new Act covering the period 1955–60. In addition, a further allocation of $1,200,000 was approved under the Development and Welfare Act of 1955 and an allocation of $480,000 under the 1959 Act.

In December 1957 a new Five-Year Development Programme was introduced covering the years 1958–62 which radically revised the development plans initiated by the previous Government. The new programme called for a total expenditure of £191·3 million but was revised to a figure of £248 million (£51·66 million) in 1961. By the end of 1961 £23·04 million had been expended compared to an estimated £33·27 million.

Great emphasis is placed on the improvement of public utilities, especially roads, electricity and water supplies and on other measures for the encouragement of basic industries. Special attention is given to the development of Tobago.

The Programme provides for social and economic projects, e.g. water, roads and bridges, education, health, local government, housing, etc. Of £55,325,085 spent in 1959 water accounted for £7,720,471, roads and bridges £5,694,099, electricity £8,296,754, housing £1,270,541, public buildings £2,019,283, local government £2,861,082.

Comparative figures (estimated) for 1960 are:

- Water £5,351,000, roads and bridges £6,718,556, electricity £9,225,180, housing £5,952,303, public buildings £1,610,250, local government £4,394,303, industry £8,457,463, agriculture £2,218,267.

Estimated contribution from revenue to meet the capital cost of 1961 projects is put at £35,600,000, from Colonial Development and Welfare funds £510,000, and from loans and other sources £33,890,000.

### Other Development

The Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance, 1950, provides for the granting of specific reliefs from Customs duty and income tax to persons establishing new industries in the Colony. In 1951 the Rugby Portland Cement Company Limited, in association with the Colonial Development Corporation, set up the Trinidad Cement Company Limited, with a capital of $8,000,000, to undertake the manufacture of cement. Up to the end of June 1960 the number of industries enjoying Pioneer Status under the Aid to Pioneer Industries Ordinance was 106. They included glass and glass products, time recording instruments, cardboard boxes and wooden boxes, brewing, spinning and weaving of cotton, knitted garments, poultry feeds, plastic goods including tyres, etc., electroplating, steel re-rolling, cast-iron pipes, artificial teeth, polishes, trawl fishing, pharmaceuticals, paints, oil, colour and varnishes, distemper and enamels, metal spraying, pickled meats, cement, asbestos cement products, condensed milk, flavouring oils, suitcases, wireless equipment and amplifiers, carbon dioxide gas, toilet rolls, buttons, etc., crude ore processing and refining, electrical conduit fittings, typewriters and office machines, processing of cocoa beans, neck-wear, upper leather, curry powder, etc., metal building components, coconut-shell flour, children's dresses, concrete blocks, enamel ware.

Education

Primary and secondary education in the territory is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 12 resident within two miles of a Government or assisted school. No pupil is retained on the roll of a primary school after attaining the age of 15. Secondary schools prepare pupils for the Cambridge School Certificate and Higher School Certificate examinations. On the results of the latter, five university scholarships are awarded annually by Government.

The 1960 census showed that the number of pupils attending schools was:

Government and assisted schools—175,260 (primary), 8,619 (intermediate) and 12,839 (secondary).

Private schools—21,618 (primary) and 14,919 (secondary).

In commercial and other schools there were 3,187 pupils and in institutes for higher learning there were 85 students. The Department of Education conducts evening classes for adults and the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies (situated in Jamaica) provides a programme of classes at an intermediate university level. There were over 2,322 students from the territory studying at universities in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Jamaica. Net expenditure on education (including school buildings) was $16,048,097 in 1960 as compared with $956,000 in 1938.

Libraries

The Central Library of Trinidad and Tobago has headquarters in Port of Spain, regional branches at San Fernando and Scarborough (Tobago) and several other branch libraries. There is also a Trinidad Public (Free) Library at Port of Spain and a Carnegie Free Library at San Fernando. In 1959 689,094 books were circulated through libraries.

Health

There are four general hospitals, a mental hospital, a leprosy, a tuberculosis hospital, seven district hospitals, a tuberculosis sanatorium, a leprosarium and two houses of refuge, with a total of 3,756 beds. In 1958 the daily average number of beds occupied in Port of Spain General Hospital was 520 and in San Fernando General Hospital 452, the total number of patients treated was 50,557. Health centres and rural dispensaries are maintained in the townships and in the larger villages. A public health programme is administered through the following divisions and units; malaria, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, yaws, hookworm, nutrition, health education, maternity and infant welfare and environmental sanitation as carried out by local authorities. The principal causes of death during 1958 were (apart from old age):—diseases of early infancy; diarrhoea and enteritis; cerebral haemorrhage and apoplexy; cancer; cardiac and valvular diseases; pneumonias; bronchitis; nephritis; tuberculosis (all forms).

The estimated expenditure by the Health Department in 1960 was $16,764,039 compared with $1,001,446 in 1938.

Communications

The main airfields are at Piarco, 16 miles from Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Crown Point (Tobago). Eleven airlines (British West Indian Airways, Pan American Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, K.L.M.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

A statutory Marketing Board is charged with assisting and improving the marketing and processing of agricultural and fishery produce in the interests of producers and in particular with assisting co-operative societies to dispose of their produce to the best advantage. The Board also controls the export of gros michel bananas. The other agricultural products are marketed mainly through producer associations within the framework of agreements such as the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, (Coconut) Oil and Fats Agreement, or through normal commercial channels, e.g. rum, bitters, coffee.

In 1960 there were 455 agricultural credit societies with a membership of 16,395 and assets of $3,438,955; 383 co-operative societies with approximately 35,295 members and total assets of $3,125,933; 292 credit unions with 24,025 members and total assets of $3,416,446; and 324 friendly societies with 124,991 members and liquid and invested funds amounting to $2,493,787.
