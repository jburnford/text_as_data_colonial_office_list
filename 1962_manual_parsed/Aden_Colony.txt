ADEN COLONY

Area

Aden Colony is situated about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia. The area is 75 square miles.

Population

At the census taken in 1955 the total population recorded was 138,441:

| Population Group | Percentage |
|------------------|------------|
| Arabs            | 75·2       |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 11·4      |
| Somalis          | 7·7        |
| Jews             | 6          |
| Europeans        | 3·2        |
| Others           | 1·9        |

Principal Towns

| Town                        | Population |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Aden (including Tawahi, Maala, Crater, Khormaksar) | 99,285     |
| Sheikh Othman               | 29,879     |
| Little Aden                 | 9,277      |

Though there has been no census since 1955 and no accurate figure for the population is, therefore, available, the population has increased considerably and is now estimated to be about 200,000.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas, joined by a flat sandy foreshore, comprising:

(a) The peninsula on which are situated the main town known as Crater, the wharf and shipyard area of Maala, the modern harbour suburb known as Tawahi, adjacent to which is an area leased to the Air Ministry for R.A.F. and military purposes and known collectively as Steamer Point.

(b) The isthmus known as Khormaksar where a large R.A.F. station is situated.

(c) The strip of mainland between the two peninsulas which encloses the modern harbour and contains the township of Sheikh Othman and the villages of Hiswa and Imad.

(d) The Little Aden peninsula where a modern refinery has been constructed by the Aden Petroleum Refinery Limited and where the two fishing villages of Bureika and Fukum lie.

Climate

The climate is not unhealthy, though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent, but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

History

The plundering of an Indian ship on the coast near Aden led to the capture of Aden by a successful expedition sent from Bombay by the East India Company in 1839 under Major Bailey and Captain Haines of the Indian Navy.

The need to establish coaling stations on trade routes because of the replacement of sailing ships by steamers was one of the reasons which led to the occupation of Aden by the British. Little Aden was obtained by purchase in 1868. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner’s Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden from 1st April 1937.

Constitution

By Additional Royal Instructions issued in November 1958, the following changes in the composition of the Executive Council of the Colony have become effective:

The Executive Council now consists of five ex officio members (who must include the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, and a representative of the Senior Officer of the Forces stationed in the Colony), and also “five persons who are Elected Members or
Nominated Members of the Legislative Council, but not less than three of whom shall be Elected Members, selected and appointed by the Governor who are in consequence of the Aden Colony Royal Instructions, 1961, styled Ministers. There is provision for the Governor to assign to individual Ministers responsibility for matters which he may prescribe at his discretion. Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, a Legislative Council was constituted consisting of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, and not more than eight unofficial members. The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1955, provided for the introduction of an elected element into the Legislative Council. Under this Order the Council consisted of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than five nominated official members, not more than five nominated unofficial members, and four elected members.

The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1958, provided for a Legislative Council consisting of a Speaker, five ex officio members, twelve elected members, and six nominated members. The first elections under the provisions of this Order took place on 4th January 1959.

**Land Policy**

Under the Crown Lands Ordinance, 1955, the Governor may grant lease or alienate on Her Majesty's behalf any Crown Land for building, agricultural or any other purpose, on any terms and conditions, as he may think fit.

The administration of the Crown Lands Ordinance is under the charge of a Commissioner of Lands who is appointed by the Governor.

**Taxation**

Aden is a free port and there is no general Customs tariff, but taxes are levied on alcoholic and other beverages, tobacco and manufactures thereof, non-potable alcoholic mixtures, qat, aerated waters and petroleum products. The Income Tax Ordinance, 1961, provides for the payment of a graduated tax by individuals ranging from Sh. 1/- to Sh. 15/- in the £ on chargeable income. Companies pay at the rate of Sh.6/50 in the £.

**Development Plans**

The 1955–60 Development Plan ended on 31st March 1960. Expenditure under that Plan had been as follows:

| Service                  | Expenditure |
|--------------------------|-------------|

£1,684,655 of that expenditure had been incurred before 31st March 1955 and a total of £7,117,832 was spent during the 5 year period. Since 1947 when the first post-war Development Plan was introduced a total of £10,450,000 has been spent on development together with a project costing £4 million for the capital Township works at Little Aden where a new Oil Refinery was built.

A new Development Plan for the period 1960–64 was approved by the Legislative Council during 1960 and provides for expenditure as follows:

| Service                  | Expenditure |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Social Services          | £550,000    |

|                          | £5,845,000  |

There is also a project to spend £550,000 from Electricity Department funds on increased generating capacity.

The Development Plan is being financed through the Development Fund which obtains its resources by transfers from General Revenue, Loans and Colonial Development and Welfare grants. For the period 1960–64 it is planned that £1,450,000 will come from General Revenue, £1 million from Colonial Development and Welfare grants, £274,000 from contributions from other Authorities, £2,626,000 from Loans and there is an opening balance of nearly £500,000.

**Education**

The Educational system consists of 4 years primary, 3 years of intermediate and 4–6 years of secondary schooling. Primary and Intermediate education is provided free for Adenese boys and girls; moderate fees are charged for secondary education (these may be waived for poor pupils), while allowances are paid to teachers in training. In addition, generous grants are made to Grant-in-Aid Schools. There are 18 Government Primary Schools, 13 Grant-Aided and 6 Private Schools providing education for 6,098 boys and 3,150 girls. Intermediate education is provided at 6 Government, 11 Grant-Aided and 4 Private Schools for 3,307 boys and 1,240 girls. Secondary Education is provided mainly at the
3 Government schools (2 for boys and 1 for girls) and the Technical Institute in Maala with its branch at Little Aden, providing a total of 1,753 places. A new Men's Teacher Training Centre has been opened and provides a 2 year course (83 men were enrolled in 1960). A modern women's Teacher Training Centre (which had 20 students in 1960) is nearing completion. Adult Education is provided by part-time and evening classes at the Technical Institute, by evening G.C.E. classes, special classes for the Police, Arabic Language classes for non-Arabs, and various courses for women at the Besse Centre. An agreed proportion of Protectorate students enter Colony Education Institutions.

The Education Department also undertakes a considerable amount of administration for the Overseas Studies Board and in January 1960 an Aden Students' Office was established in London with a Students' Liaison Officer. At the end of 1960 there were 77 scholars taking courses in higher education abroad; of these, 66 were provided for by the Government, including 9 Departmental Trainees. In addition, there were 41 private sponsored students as well as a considerable number of private students.

The expenditure on Colony education has risen from £6,600 in 1936 to £524,814 in 1960-61. There is provision under the current Development Plan (1960-64) for capital expenditure estimated at £550,000.

Libraries

The Lake Library, administered by the Aden Municipality, contains 20,654 books in English, Arabic and Urdu and has 1,148 members. A Travelling Library with 5,858 volumes in English and Arabic has 492 members. There are well-stocked and expanding libraries at Aden College, the Technical Institute, the Boys' Secondary School and the Girls' College. Amenities for the teaching profession include a club with a library of over 2,000 volumes.

Two charitable Out Patient Dispensaries are also operated; their attendances totalled 147,307 in 1960.

Estimated total expenditure on medical and health services by Government in 1961-62 is £480,569 as compared with £12,230 in 1936.

Communications

The Civil Air Terminal is located at Khormaksar some 7 miles from the seaport and the aerodrome lies across the isthmus between the upper reaches of the inner harbour and the shore of the gulf of Aden. The aerodrome is jointly used by the Royal Air Force and the Department of Civil Aviation. The main runway which is 10 feet above sea-level is bitumenised and has a length of 8,386 feet, and is of a construction to permit its use by the heaviest of modern aircraft. Technical services for the common use of military and civil aircraft are jointly provided by the Royal Air Force and the Department of Civil Aviation.

Ten airlines operate scheduled services from, to and through the Civil Air Terminal: Aden Airways, Air-India International, Alitalia, B.O.A.C., East African Airways Corporation, Ethiopian Air Lines, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Sudan Airways and United Arab Airlines. Three of these airlines operate Comet or Boeing 707 jet aircraft.

Operating a fleet of 7 DC3 and 3 Argonaut aircraft, the local airline, Aden Airways, Limited, an associate of B.O.A.C., maintains a domestic network of regular services to destinations in the Protectorate as well as scheduled services on international trunk routes to East Africa, Ethiopia, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Egypt.

The Colony has a total of 112·2 miles of roads, of which 60·9 are asphalted. There are no railways.

The vessels of the principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden and the number of vessels which entered the Port of Aden during 1960, exclusive of country craft, was 5,972, with a tonnage of 27,646,403. The number of country craft which entered the Port during the same period was 1,495 with an aggregate tonnage of 136,522. There are 22 first-class berths and 6 second-class berths. The first-class berths are suitable for ships of from 350 to 800 feet in length. The second-class berths are suitable for ships of about 300 feet in length. Thirteen of the first-class berths are fitted with submarine pipelines for fuelling ships. There is also an 800 feet long quay with a depth alongside of 18 feet suitable for coasting vessels of up to 2,500 tons gross. Transit and storage sheds on the public wharves provide a total covered space of 400,000 square feet. The approach channel is dredged to 36 feet, and three of the largest fuelling berths are dredged to 39 feet. The Oil Harbour at Little Aden has four jetty berths, the approach channel being dredged to 38 feet and the Oil Harbour to 40 feet.

Broadcasting

The Aden Broadcasting Service, a part of the Public Relations and Information Department, inaugurated in 1954 transmits for 11 hours daily in Arabic on short wave 41·8 metres and medium wave 375 metres. The transmitters now in use are 7kW. and 5kW. respectively, and are situated at Hiswa. It is estimated that about 30,000 receivers are in use in the Colony and a similar number in the Protectorate.
Principal Occupations

Of the estimated local labour force of 62,223, some 7,490 are engaged in Port activities such as bunkering, handling of cargo, ship repairing, manning harbour vessels, and so forth; 9,026 in building and construction, 1,800 in oil refining, 9,140 in industrial undertakings, 7,137 in retail and wholesale trades, 6,884 in Government and Services Departments, 746 in miscellaneous trades, and 20,000 in the hotel and catering trade and in private domestic service.

Main Products

There is no agriculture in the Colony and the only important local product is salt which is made from sea water by solar evaporation; production in 1960 was 127,641 long tons.

The amount of fish caught in Colony waters tends to be somewhat erratic, but in a good season the total landings may be in the region of 5,000 tons, of which over 1,000 tons is consumed locally, the surplus being sold overseas through exporters of salt and dried fish. The overall catch rate has been improved through the greater use by local fishermen of nylon fishing nets and mechanized boats based on the local pattern. The bulk of landings in the Colony consists of King-fish, and Indian Mackerel, Tunny and various types of Horse Mackerel. The Aden Government Fisheries vessel "Gulf Explorer" is extensively used on active fishing operations in order to consolidate developments already achieved and to extend overall development policy of the Fisheries Department.

The Oil Refinery at Little Aden produces refined petroleum from imported crude oil. In July 1961 the Refinery had been in commission for seven years and in that time had processed over 25 million tons of crude oil. The products were exported either by tanker or as fuel for ships' bunkers; a small percentage was retained in Aden to meet local demand.

Because of its favourable geographical position and its efficient service to ships, Aden has become one of the busiest oil bunkering ports in the world.

There are small factories in the Colony which produce a variety of items: soap, carbon dioxide, recombined acetylene milk, soft drinks, aluminium pots and pans, cigarettes, dyed and printed cloth, wooden furniture, bricks, tiles and retreaded tyres. There is a small but flourishing industry for the blending and packing of perfumes, hair oil and toilet waters; a modern mechanical mill crushes oil seeds. Some of the Colony produce is sold locally and some is exported to neighbouring territories.

Trade (excluding bullion and specie)

| Year | Imports       | Exports       |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 1956 | £71,227,903  | £64,455,923  |
| 1957 | £71,923,378  | £65,300,543  |
| 1958 | £71,771,662  | £63,497,937  |
| 1959 | £72,370,247  | £61,216,902  |
| 1960 | £76,580,601  | £60,032,136  |

* Include ships' stores and bunkers.

The trade of Aden is mainly transhipment and entrepôt, the port serving as a centre of distribution to and from neighbouring territories. Traditional trade is mainly in textiles, gums and resins, grains and flour, coffee, tea, hides and skins, raw cotton and cottonseed and cheap consumer goods. There is also trade in dates, sugar, spices, oils, tobacco and shells and a flourishing trade in luxury goods such as cameras, watches, binoculars and cosmetics, which are sold to passengers coming ashore from ships refuelling in Aden Harbour.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Central Wholesale Produce Market, opened at Khormaksar in 1959, is administered by the Adviser on Co-operative Development as the Authority under the provisions of the Produce Marketing Ordinance, 1958. Its purpose is to rationalize the wholesale of fruit and vegetables in the interests of both the producers in the Protectorate and the consumers in the Colony.

The Co-operative and Marketing Department has introduced co-operation to the fishermen for fishing requisites in the Colony waters and two societies have been formed. One co-operative canteen amongst a section of civil servants has been successfully launched and two others are in process of formation.

Co-operative Societies Rules, 1961, under the Co-operative Societies Ordinance, 1957, were made by the Governor-in-Council in August 1961.

PROTECTORATE

Area

The total area is approximately 111,000 square miles, including the Island of Socotra. The Protectorate is divided into Western and Eastern Areas.

Population is estimated at:

Western Area :: :: :: 550,000
Eastern Area :: :: :: 450,000

1,000,000

Towns

There are no large towns in the Western Aden Protectorate but in the Eastern Protectorate Mukalla, the sea port, has a population of some 20,000.

Geographical Features

The Aden Protectorate is bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba' al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen, and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt, which varies between
4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges, about 1,000–2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains, over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Empty Quarter with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate also has a littoral belt, which is backed by a rock plateau rising to a height of 6,000 feet and continuing inland for about 100 miles, where it breaks up into a system of wadis, some fertile, leading into the main Wadi Hadhramaut. Beyond, to the north, are the sands of the Empty Quarter.

Climate

The altitude, which ranges from sea level up to 8,000 feet, is responsible for considerable variations in temperature, humidity and rainfall. On the coastal plain torrid tropical conditions of great heat and humidity exist in the summer months. During the same period in the mid-altitude zones it is hot but less humid, while at the highest altitudes the climate is warm and temperate but can in the winter be extremely cold. The whole area falls within the influence of the northeast and south-west monsoons. Rainfall in the coastal areas averages approximately two inches a year; in the most favoured areas of the Western Aden Protectorate highlands it may average ten inches. In general, rainfall decreases from west to east until, in the north-east section, conditions of extreme aridity are encountered.

History

For a time in the eighteenth century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana'a in the Yemen and several of the rulers of the tribal districts were the Imam's "wakils" or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with Her Majesty's Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being in 1954.

In July 1915, during the first World War, the Turks, who had conquered the Yemen in the course of the previous century, occupied the Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts of the Protectorate until the Armistice of 1918.

In 1934 a Treaty of Friendship was signed between Her Majesty's Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen. There was an Exchange of Notes in 1951 when it was agreed to establish reciprocal diplomatic missions and to set up a Frontier Commission.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa'i Sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala) entered into closer relations with Her Majesty's Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations. Similar treaties were signed by the Upper Aulaqi Sheikh and the Audhali Sultan in 1952, and by the Sheikh of Shu'eib in 1954. In 1952 the newly elected Sultan of Lahej accepted a political officer as adviser.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri Sultans and the rise of the Qu'aiti—a new Yafa'i dynasty which gained power and wealth from military and other services rendered by its members abroad to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu'aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with Her Majesty's Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri Sultan made an agreement with the Qu'aiti Sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu'aiti and Kathiri Sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British resident adviser in all matters except those concerning Mohammedan religion and custom. The Wahidi Sultan of Balhaf signed an Advisory Treaty in 1949, and a similar treaty was signed by the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra in 1954.

Administration

Her Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly but the British Advisory Staff advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas.

In the Western Aden Protectorate the States nominate their own heads, who have subsequently to be recognized by Her Majesty's Government. Not all the heads of the States and tribal chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery and in several States an efficient administration is now functioning. There are now State Councils in Lower Yafa'i, Amiri, Lower Aulaqi, Shu'eibi, Fadhli, Dathina, Beihan and Upper Aulaqi and there is a Legislative Council in Lahej. For internal security some of the States raised Tribal Guards, partly paid by Her Majesty's Government. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force called the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal States are the Qu'aiti and Kathiri which are administered by their Sultans as constitutional rulers and have State Councils. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the supervision of the Resident Adviser and British Agent, Eastern Aden Protectorate. The island of Socotra is linked administratively with the mainland territory of Qishn under the Sultan of Qishn and Socotra.

Federation of Arab Emirates of the South

On 11th February 1959 a Federation of six states in the Western Aden Protectorate, called the Federation of Arab Emirates of the South, was inaugurated and a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Federation. The six federated states were the Emirates of Beihan and of Dhala, the Fadhli, Audhali and Lower Yafa'i Sultanates, and the Upper Aulaqi Sheikhdom. The treaty extended Her Majesty's protection to the Federation and provided for military and financial assistance to the Federation. The Treaty also binds the Federal Government to accept and implement British advice on matters relating to good government of the Federation. It also provided for the possibility of other states in the Protectorate acceding to the Federation (see Cmd. 665). The Sultanate of Lahej acceded to the Federation in October 1959 followed by the Dathina, the Lower Aulaqi Sultanate and the Aqrabi Sheikhdom in February 1960. Several other states are expected to accede in the near future.
The Federation has a legislative body called the Federal Council; the executive authority is exercised by the Supreme Council, made up of the Ministers of the Federation.

For internal security within the Federation the Government Guards and the Tribal Guards of the Federated States have now been amalgamated into one force known as the Federal Guard. The Federal Minister of Internal Security is responsible to the Supreme Council for the control of this force.

In November 1961 the Aden Protectorate Levies became the Federal Army, which constitutes the Defence force of the Federation.

Details of Federation finance, development plans, education, health, etc., are entered under the relevant headings for the Protectorate as a whole.

Land Policy

Land ownership is subject to tribal law and Mohammedan law. Except for a fractional area, land is held by the indigenous inhabitants. The local State Governments are, in some cases, important owners of land. Land is held in absolute ownership and in trusts (waqfs). Land settlement is in progress in the Abyan area, Western Protectorate.

Taxation

The bulk of revenue collected by the Protectorate States comes from indirect taxes in the shape of Customs, excise and licence dues; in addition tithes are collected on agricultural products.

Development Plans

Between 1945 and 1958 the Aden Protectorate received allocations totalling £1,720,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. Under the 1959 Act a further £1,000,000 has been allocated for the three-year period up to 1962. The Federation of Arab Amirates of the South has now become an Administering Authority for C.D. & W. Schemes and has drawn up its own Development Plan covering the years 1961-64. It is anticipated that expenditure on projects under this plan will rise to £4,000,000 per annum in 1962-63. A separate Development Plan for the Eastern Aden Protectorate seeks to spend up to £300,000 per annum on development in the Eastern States. Projects cover education, agriculture, fisheries, communications, health, marketing, information services and a geological survey.

The largest development scheme, that in Abyan initiated in 1947, aims to achieve a better use of land and water resources, and has developed at a satisfactory rate in all fields where adequate staff, machinery and materials could be mustered. The scheme is administered by the Abyan Board, consisting of representatives of the two States in the Abyan area, with Governmental advice available, and which works in partnership with landowners and owner-occupiers or tenant farmers. Cotton is grown as a main crop and marketed by the Board. An area of approximately 50,000 acres is now controlled for irrigation farming out of an estimated gross area of 120,000 acres.
Other Development

The Qu’aiti State has allocated money to a total amount of £350,000 for development schemes throughout the State; the original allocation of £75,000 was, and is still being, used for promoting agriculture in the Wadi Hadhramaut by lift irrigation and flood control. Among the development projects now under consideration are harbour improvement, hospital improvement, the purchase of modern machinery to maintain roads, a fisheries scheme and the setting up of a Technical College. The Kathiri State has £41,000 allocated for agricultural development.

Education

In the Western Protectorate, most of whose States are comprised in the Federation of the Arab Emirates of the South, there are 91 primary streams for boys and 10 primary streams for girls, with 6,472 and 620 pupils respectively. Approximately half of these pupils are in their first year and approximately a quarter in the second year, not as a result of retardation, but because of the large number of primary streams opened in the past two years. These figures do not include Koranic schools. Six Intermediate Schools, comprising nine streams, had an enrolment of 488 boys, of whom nearly half are in their first year. There is as yet no Girls’ Intermediate School, but it is hoped to meet what is now a keen popular demand in 1962. Provision for secondary education is at present made by a number of places in Aden College, but a secondary school is projected for 1962. The training of teachers, for whom the demand far exceeds the supply, and likewise technical training, is most in Aden Colony. A small number of persons are undergoing university training in the United Kingdom.

In the Eastern Protectorate there is at present no educational system in the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra. There are only 5 primary streams in the Wahidi State of Balhaf. The Qu’aiti State is thus, by comparison, most remarkably advanced. It has 37 boys’ primary streams with 5,800 pupils, and 7 girls’ primary streams with 1,060 pupils. It has 5 intermediate streams for boys; the first girls’ Intermediate stream has been opened. The neighbouring Kathiri State has a higher proportion of primary school enrolment. There are 2,181 boys in 18 primary streams and 480 girls in two girls’ primary schools. The State has plans to include in its system 7 Koranic schools which contain 1,200 boys, and, when this has been effected, will be providing a four-year primary course for virtually every boy in the State. There is at present only one Intermediate School, at Saiun, but more are now projected. The Qu’aiti and Kathiri States have teacher training facilities at Gheil ba-Wazir, but neither has any technical training facilities. Secondary education is catered for in Aden Colony and in the Sudan, but a secondary school is projected at Mukalla in 1962.

Total expenditure on education for the year 1960–61 was £371,531 divided between the Western and Eastern Protectorates.

Health

A Health Adviser, Aden Protectorate, first appointed in 1951, directs the H.M.G. element of the Protectorate Health Service and advises the States elements. The former comprises advisory staff in the Eastern Protectorate and a small body of specialists serving both Protectorates. The States elements are the Ministry of Health of the Federation of the Arab Emirates of the South, covering all Western Protectorate health commitments, and in the East the well developed Qu’aiti and Kathiri Health Services and the smaller State Services of the Balhaf, Bir Ali and Mahri Sultanates which in fact are administered by the H.M.G. element. There are in all, 25 doctors in both Protectorates working in eight hospitals to which are linked some 76 rural health units. These are run by health assistants, literate in Arabic, derived from local inhabitants and trained in simple curative and preventive skills. There are two base hospitals to which are attached health services training centres for male and female sub-professional staff and mobile sanitation units. That for the Federal Service in the West is at Makhzan, in the Abyan area, that for the East is in Mukalla in the Qu’aiti State.

Communications

A regular air service by Aden Airways is maintained throughout the year between Aden and Mukeiras, and between Aden, Riyam (18 miles from Mukalla) and Ghuraf (14 miles from Siyoun) on a thrice-weekly service which also calls once a week at Al Qatn in the Wadi Hadhramaut. A weekly service is also maintained between Aden and Raudah in Wahidi country.

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate. Increasing use is being made of motor vehicles. These are for the most part driven along sandy beaches, dry river beds or across open desert, but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic and in a few cases new roads have been cut through difficult country. Roads are extremely rough and surfaces are infrequently repaired. Routes for new and improved roads are being surveyed.

A coastal road in the Eastern Aden Protectorate runs from Reidat al Abdal Wadud in the east through Shihr, Mukalla, Bir Ali and Balhaf to connect with the Western Aden Protectorate. Roads run inland from Shihr and Mukalla to the Wadi Hadhramaut and from near Balhaf to Azzan and Habban. The approximate total mileage of motorable tracks in the Eastern Aden Protectorate is 2,680 miles. The desert between the Wadi Hadhramaut and Beihan is also traversed by motors. Where these cannot yet penetrate the traffic is carried on camel caravans, which still travel to Aden from the Western Aden Protectorate and to Mukalla and Shihr from other parts of the Eastern Aden Protectorate in large numbers. Donkeys are also employed for both passengers and goods.

Sea communications along the coast of the Protectorate are mainly by dhows, some of which have auxiliary engines. Small powered craft and coastal steamers make occasional and irregular visits to Mukalla and Shihr from Aden and ocean-going vessels of the conventional type call at Mukalla from time to time.

Principal Occupations

Agriculture employs about 90 per cent. of the population; other occupations are fishing, dyeing, weaving and preparation of hides and skins.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton (long staple), cotton seed, sorghum, millet, bulrush millet, dates, wheat, barley, sesame and Hamami tobacco. Secondary products are vegetables and citrus and the export of hides and skins.
Cotton, first introduced into the Fadhli and Lower Yafa'i areas of the Western Protectorate in 1949, is now being grown in several States of the Western Protectorate and on a small scale in two of the States of the Eastern Protectorate. Lint production figures from the ginnery show a gross return over the last three years of approximately £1,301,000 per annum.

Production figures (statistical bales of 400 lb. cotton lint) are:

| Season   | Bales |
|----------|-------|
| 1949-50  | 100   |
| 1950-51  | 1,587 |
| 1951-52  | 9,890 |
| 1952-53  | 11,161|
| 1953-54  | 21,736|
| 1954-55  | 22,140|
| 1955-56  | 30,700|
| 1956-57  | 28,310|
| 1957-58  | 29,000|
| 1958-59  | 18,806|
| 1959-60  | 34,524|
| 1960-61  | 21,554|

A rough estimate of the livestock population is:

- Camels: 80,000
- Cattle: 68,000
- Goats: 855,000
- Sheep: 200,000
- Donkeys: 7,000

The annual catch of wet fish has been estimated at 70,000 tons for a good season. At least 75 per cent. of this is taken in the Eastern Aden Protectorate. Most of the fish is cured for consumption inland and for export to East Africa and the Far East. There is a market interest in the use of nylon fishing nets and this new knowledge is disseminated along the Protectorate coast by migrant fishermen and further demonstration by the staff of the Fisheries Department.

**External Trade**

The principal imports are grain, flour, rice, dates, sugar, sesame oil, tea, kerosene, spice, cloth, cotton piece-goods, tobacco, cigarettes, soap and glassware.

The principal exports are cotton, coffee, skins and hides, lime, Hamami tobacco, cattle, ghee, sheep, goats and fish.

The great bulk of trade with the Western Aden Protectorate goes by land from the town of Aden, and that with the Eastern Aden Protectorate goes by sea to the port of Mukalla. No reliable figures are available.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

The marketing of cotton in the Protectorate is undertaken by the Abyan Board and the Lahej Development Board independently. It deals not only with the crops from lands within the area of the Board but also with the cotton grown in other States in the Eastern and Western Aden Protectorates. In the Western Aden Protectorate the local handling of the crop is now undertaken by cotton producers' associations, six of which have been established as a result of decrees by the States concerned. The total value of the cotton produced by these associations in 1961 exceeded £500,000. Five co-operative credit and marketing societies have been organised among the Western Protectorate fruit and vegetable farmers to facilitate the marketing of horticultural produce and to assist in the provision of credit. Produce sold through the Central Wholesale Produce Market in Aden by members of these societies was valued at approximately £250,000 in 1960. School Co-operative Thrift societies are now 11 in number and two other schools have formed consumer societies amongst the children.

In the Eastern Protectorate a tobacco growers' credit co-operative society has been established and also a school consumer society. Experiments are well ahead on the formation of a fish supply organization for certain areas of the Protectorate as well as the supply of crayfish to Aden and other markets.

**THE ISLANDS**

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the Island the same year. It was later re-occupied by the British in January 1837.

The five Kuria Muria Islands were ceded to the United Kingdom in 1854 by the Sultan of Oman for purposes of a cable station.

The Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1959, restricts the application of the Aden Colony Order, 1936, as amended in relation to the Island of Perim and the Kuria Muria Islands, for the Government of which provision is made by the Perim Order in Council, 1959, and the Kuria Muria Islands Order in Council, 1959. These Islands are no longer included among the responsibilities of the Colony Executive and Legislative Councils but are administered directly by the Governor, through a Commissioner in each case. Legislative power is vested in the Governor.

**KAMARAN ISLAND**

The island of Kamaran in the Red Sea (area 22 square miles) has been in British occupation since 1915. It does not form part of either the Colony of Aden or the Aden Protectorate, but the Governor of Aden is also the Governor of Kamaran under the provisions of the Kamaran Order in Council, 1949. Prior to that the island was under the control of the Government of India, exercised through the Governor of Aden and a local Civil Administrator, whose designation became Commissioner in 1949. Until 1953 a Quarantine Station was run in Kamaran for pilgrims on their way to Jedda by sea. This has now been closed.

Expenditure on the administration of Kamaran in 1960-61 was £40,755, of which £38,666 was contributed by Her Majesty's Government.

The island has an airport and Aden Airways planes land there on scheduled services.
