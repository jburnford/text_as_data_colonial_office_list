KENYA

Area
The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is bisected by the equator and extends approximately from latitude 4° N. to latitude 4° S. and from longitude 34° E. to 41° E.
The total area is 224,960 square miles (including 5,171 square miles of water).

Population
At 1st July 1961 the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at some 7·29 million persons, of whom 7·0 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe       | Population |
|-------------|------------|
| Kikuyu      | 19·5%      |
| Luo         | 14·4%      |
| Baluhya     | 12·5%      |
| Kamba       | 11·7%      |
| Meru        | 6·2%       |
| Nyika       | 5·6%       |

The total non-African population in mid-1960 has been estimated at 289,000.

Geographical Features
Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the
Taita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Nyiru 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,104). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30-40 miles wide and 2,000-3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Principal Towns and Port

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Jubba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which will supersede the original agreement of 1907, when the demarcated frontier is ratified.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £16,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1887 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the administration of the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891) and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution

Certain changes have been made in the Kenya constitution as a result of the Lancaster House Conference held in London during January/February 1960. The changes agreed at this Conference were published in an amending Order in Council, the provisions of which came into force on 7th December 1960 and the 23rd December 1960, respectively. Further changes were made in the amending Orders in Council which came into operation on 31st October and 2nd December 1961.

In accordance with the Kenya (Constitution) Orders in Council, 1958-1961 and the Royal Instructions, the Colony and Protectorate is administered by a Governor and Commander-in-Chief who is advised by a Council of Ministers. There is provision for such number of Ministers as may be prescribed by Her Majesty, by instructions given to the Governor through the Secretary of State. At present, and until Her Majesty otherwise directs by such instructions, the Council of Ministers consists of not more than 12 Ministers, of whom three are civil servants. There are nine unofficial Ministers; five of these are Africans, three are Europeans and one is an Asian. The Deputy Governor is also a Member of the Council of Ministers. There are also Parliamentary Secretaries appointed by the Governor whose duties and functions are to assist Ministers in the exercise of their duties. The Governor's Personal Adviser on Arab Affairs has the right to attend and participate in meetings of the Council of Ministers.

The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, appointed by the Governor; "Ex Officio Members", who are Ministers or temporary Ministers, but not otherwise members of the Legislative Council; 53 Constituency Elected Members, of whom 33 are African, 10 European, 8 Asian and 2 Arab; 12 National Members elected by the Council sitting as an Electoral College, of whom 4 are African, 3 are Asian, 4 are European and 1 is an Arab; and a varying number of Nominated Members, at present 11, nominated by the Governor.

A Council of State, designed to protect any community against harmful discriminatory legislation, has also been established under the Order and may consist of a chairman and not more than 16 and not less than 10 members.

Discussions in London during June 1961 at which representatives of Governments participating in the East Africa High Commission took part, have resulted in certain changes. A new body known as the East African Common Services Organisation has been set up and Kenya representation in the new Central Legislative Assembly will consist of 4 Ministers and 9 Members elected by the Legislative Council. A Conference, under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State, to prepare the constitutional framework for full internal self-government in preparation for independence began in London on 14th February 1962 and a Conference on the future of the 1895 Agreement relating to the Kenya Protectorate also began in London on 8th March. Both Conferences were still meeting at the time of going to press.
Six Municipalities are established under the Municipalities Ordinance, 1928: the City of Nairobi, the Municipal Councils of Eldoret, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu and the Municipal Board of Kitale. All these municipalities now have elected as well as nominated members, the elected members being elected on the basis of Communal Rolls. Seven County Councils are established under the County Councils Ordinance, 1952: Nairobi, Nakuru, Naivasha, Aberdare, Nyanza, Kitale and Uasin Gishu. There are elected and nominated members, the former being elected on Communal Rolls. Thirty-two African District Councils are established under the African District Councils Ordinance, 1950 and they exercise powers and functions similar to those of other local authorities. There are both elected and nominated members and the electors are the ratepayers, i.e. generally excluding women.

Second-tier local authorities have been established in the areas of County Councils, where they are known as Urban or Rural District Councils and in the areas of African District Councils, where they are known as Locational Councils. In a few Townships, Township Accounts are kept, and the Township Committee operates on Local Government principles but without corporate status.

Following the approval of Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1961 by the Legislative Council, a new Local Government Ordinance is now being drafted. The new Ordinance will, in broad terms: (a) provide one legislative framework for all types of local authority; (b) provide for new constitutions for all local authorities; (c) alter the franchise for local government elections and replace communal electoral rolls by common rolls; (d) provide the framework within which African District Councils can progress to the status of County Councils; (e) establish some of the Township Authorities as Township Boards, which will be corporate bodies and provide for the inclusion of others within the areas of existing local authorities.

**Land Policy**

All land in Kenya now falls into one of three categories: (a) Crown lands; (b) Trust lands; (c) Private lands. Crown lands include all leasehold land in the Colony, unalienated land and the Special Reserves, Temporary Special Reserves, Special Leasehold Areas, Special Settlement Areas and Communal Reserves. All unalienated Crown land, whether within a municipality or a township, may be alienated to persons of any race, but in townships and municipalities, the terms of the leases are still restricted to 99 years.

Unalienated Crown land outside municipalities and townships may be granted for agricultural purposes for an initial term corresponding to that required for development, with provision for the grant of freehold (on payment) on completion of the initial development. In pursuance of the Government's policy to place the management and tenure of all land on the same non-racial basis as declared in Kenya Government Sessional Papers Nos. 10 of 1958–59 and 6 of 1959–60, dealings in land in the Declared Areas require the consent of the appropriate Divisional Land Control Board, of which there are twelve, but the question of race is not a factor to be considered. It is now possible for the holder of a leasehold property held from the Crown for agricultural purposes to apply for and be granted a freehold title on payment of 18 times the current annual rent.

The Special Areas (Trust Land) were created by the Kenya (Native Areas) Order in Council, 1939, since superseded by the Kenya (Land) Order in Council, 1960. The Order in Council vests the Special Areas in the Trust Land Board and preserves for the inhabitants thereof all rights and interests enjoyed under native customary law and the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of land is also governed by customary law except in so far as specific provision is contained in the Trust Ordinance (Cap. 100 of the Revised Laws of Kenya). This is still the case in the greater part of the Special Areas to-day, but the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance, enacted in 1959, makes provision for the recognition, by registration, of rights of ownership under customary law as freehold and of lesser rights not amounting to freehold. When land has been registered in private ownership it ceases to vest in the Trust Land Board but that Board is registered as the freehold proprietor of all parcels of land which are not claimed in individual ownership or which are used for public purposes. Individual title has already been registered over large areas of the Kikuyu Districts and parts of the Nandi, Elgeyo/Marakwet and Baringo Districts. In registered areas, except as regards inheritance and succession, native law and custom and the Trust Land Ordinance are superseded by the provisions of the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance and the ordinary land laws of the Colony. The Land Control (Special Areas) Regulations, 1961, provide for control over land transactions to be exercised by Provincial and Divisional Boards, of which the composition is predominantly African. It is the intention gradually to extend this system of registration and control to other parts of the Special Areas where the concept of individual ownership has emerged.

Private land includes all land held in fee simple under either the Land Titles Ordinance, the Crown Lands Ordinance or the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance, 1959.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation which apply to all communities are income tax and personal tax. The maximum rate of personal tax in 1959 was Shs. 150/-. Under the Income Tax Acts generous personal allowances are given. The rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income and increases gradually to a maximum rate of Shs. 15/- in the £ where the chargeable income exceeds £9,000. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/10 in the £. A graduated hospital tax calculated on total income is also payable by all Europeans and Asians.

Currency

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board whose headquarters are in Kenya, on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-, and Shs. 1/- notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

Under the ten-year Development Programme, 1946-55, £38·8 million was allocated, of which £27·4 million was spent over the eight years 1946-53. Of this expenditure 45% was financed from loans, 24% from Colony revenue and 18% from various appropriated funds.

A new Development Programme covered the three and a half years, 1954-57, during which £21·7 million was spent, mainly from loan moneys. Other development expenditure outside the three-and-a-half-year programme amounted to £13·8 million during the same planning period, making a total of £35·5 million in all.

Total expenditure under the 1957-60 Development Programme, which embraced all important development projects, amounted to £26·8 million. Expenditure currently envisaged under the 1960-63 Development Programme amounts to £36·2 million.

Education (1960)

Europeans: 49 primary schools (19 Government, 1 local government, 14 aided, 15 unaided) with altogether 9,455 pupils, 14 secondary schools (6 Government, 2 aided, 6 unaided) with altogether 3,507 pupils.

Asian including Goan and mixed races: 122 primary schools (29 Government, 88 aided and 5 unaided) with altogether 42,023 pupils, 35 secondary schools (12 Government, 11 aided and 12 unaided) with altogether 10,156 pupils, 3 Government teacher-training centres with altogether 355 students.

African: 4,096 primary schools (8 Government, 3,617 aided and 471 unaided) with altogether 619,168 pupils, 928 intermediate schools (10 Government, 894 aided, 24 unaided) with altogether 107,724 pupils, 41 secondary schools (1 Government, 32 aided, 8 unaided) with altogether 5,409 pupils, 42 teacher-training centres (40 aided and 2 unaided) with altogether 4,089 students.

Arab: 11 primary schools (8 Government and 3 aided) with altogether 2,925 pupils, 1 aided secondary school with 345 pupils. In addition, 18 Arab pupils were studying in Asian Government schools and 10 in Asian unaided schools.

Higher Education

During the year 1960, there were 399 students from Kenya (including 30 Asians and 1 European) studying at Makerere College in Uganda.

The Royal Technical College of East Africa was opened in Nairobi in April, 1956. There are Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Science, Engineering and Commerce and a Department of...
Domestic Science. In 1960 there were 201 Kenya students studying at the College consisting of 13 Europeans, 106 Asians and 82 Africans.

The Royal Technical College will gain University College status for the 1961-62 academic year and will become one of the constituent colleges of the projected University of East Africa.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education in institutions overseas as well as in Makerere College and the Royal Technical College, Nairobi. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Governments of India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Ghana, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

In addition to these awards a new scheme has been started to assist in the higher education of Government servants which provides "Kenya Development Scholarships", open to Kenya Government servants of all races recommended by the Heads of their Departments, to pursue courses which will either improve their capacity as Government servants or fit them for promotion.

An Educational Trust has been formed by a private donor called the Maniben and Mohamedali Rattansi Educational Trust. In the terms of the Trust the income is divided into five equal parts for awards annually to Europeans, Africans, Muslims, non-Muslims and Ismailis. Awards are made from this Trust to students of all races for studies in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere.

The total number of Kenya students taking courses of higher education in the United Kingdom during 1960 was 1,158. This number included 126 Africans (71 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 764 Asians and Goans (123 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 16 Arabs (12 with bursaries, scholarships or loans) and 252 Europeans (84 with bursaries, scholarships or loans).

Trade and Technical Education

There were, in 1959, five Government Technical and Trade Schools for African boys, admitting students who had completed eight years of schooling, for a three or four-year course of training; in 1960, 1,228 indentured apprentices were receiving instruction in building, engineering, tailoring and leather-work trades. Each year 40 boys are selected by competitive examination for admission to Secondary Technical courses leading to the General Certificate of Education of the Associated Examining Board at Ordinary level. Sixteen pupils were admitted for a clerical course.

Vocational training was also given in one aided school and at a number of unaided rural training centres. A number of Government Departments and the East African Railways and Harbours and the Posts and Telecommunications Administrations, conducted training courses for students from the intermediate and secondary schools entering their service.

The Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education, which ranks as a Technical Institute, had 265 students enrolled in 1960.

There were two Asian Technical High Schools providing courses in technical and commercial subjects to School Certificate level. Technical Institute classes in Nairobi were organized in temporary accommodation during 1960; 104 students attended day-release classes in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering subjects and 248 students attended part-time evening classes in Technical Commercial subjects.

Government expenditure on education in 1960-61 was:

| Expenditure Item          | £       |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Gross expenditure         | 7,410,058|
| Net expenditure           | 6,489,351|
| Appropriations-in-aid     | 920,707 |

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library, which caters for all races, in addition to the Desai Memorial Library, also in Nairobi, and the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. In Nairobi the British Council and the United States Information Service maintain lending libraries and reading rooms open to the public. There is a large collection of reference books on natural sciences in the Coryndon Memorial Museum in Nairobi.

The East African Literature Bureau runs book box services for African readers throughout the Colony where bookshops are unknown.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Acting Curator, R. H. Carcasson, is assisted by a staff of six Europeans and seventeen Africans.

The Snake Park was opened to the public at the beginning of 1960. It is administered by the Museum Trustees of Kenya and directed by J. H. E. Leakey assisted by a staff of three Africans.

Fort Jesus, Mombasa's three centuries old Portuguese monument, was opened to the public as a museum in 1960. It contains archaeological and historical specimens from the former fortress and from other parts of the African Coast.

Health

The principal causes of mortality are general infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, alimentary, allergic, metabolic and blood diseases in that order. Towards the end of 1959 a poliomyelitis epidemic started in Central Province and spread throughout Kenya. The number of cases steadily increased from 57 in October 1959 to 189 in March 1960. An Oral Poliomyelitis Vaccine Campaign commenced in February and ended in December 1960. Some 1,750,000 doses of the Sabin type one vaccine were administered; of these, over 610,000 were given to children under six years old. The estimated Colony population of this latter group is 1.3 million and during this epidemic those affected were mostly African children under the age of two years. By April the peak of the epidemic had passed and it waned until, from August onwards, less than 30 cases per month were reported.
In 1960 beds in hospitals (including Government and non-Government hospitals) totalled 10,419. In-patients in Government hospitals totalled 156,877 and out-patients 1,166,765. The development of Health Centres continued and at the end of 1960 130 were in operation.

Total expenditure of the Medical Department in the financial year ending 30th June 1960 was £2,211,444 together with Development expenditure of £269,504.

Communications

East African Airways Corporation operates in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, Kitale and Malindi as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of charter aircraft-operating companies are based at Wilson Airport (formerly called Nairobi West).

All scheduled international and internal services are operated from the new Nairobi airport at Embakasi whilst Wilson Airport (formerly Nairobi West) is retained for smaller charter operations and club flying. Eastleigh Airport is now used by the Royal Air Force mainly as a maintenance base and both their transit and locally based aircraft normally operate from Embakasi.

Air Traffic Control and Telecommunications Services are provided by the Directorate of Civil Aviation, East Africa, and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. Air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the East Africa High Commission.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Congo, Aden and Madagascar.

In mid-1961 there were approximately 26,000 miles of grant-earning roads; only about 750 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads 3,739 miles, where not bitumenized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (6,200 miles) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. A £4-million Contractor-Finance Scheme for the bitumenization of trunk roads which started in 1959 will be completed in 1963 and a £1-million International Bank Loan Scheme for the improvement of roads in African Areas of high agricultural potential, which started in 1960, will also be completed in 1963.

Broadcasting

Kenya was the first British Colonial Territory to have a regular public wireless broadcasting service. Until 1st October 1959 there were three broadcasting organizations in Nairobi:

(i) Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited provided services in the English and Asian languages under a Charter granted to them in 1931. This Charter expired in September 1956 but by an agreement between the Company and the Government Cable and Wireless continued to provide these services.

(ii) The Kenya Government through its Department of Information operated a service for African listeners in Swahili and many vernacular languages. It was known as the African Broadcasting Service and broadcasts from four stations at Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nyeri.

(iii) The Forces Broadcasting Station has been operating since 1944 a service for British troops stationed within the Colony.

In 1954 the Kenya Government appointed a Commission, three of whose four members were B.B.C. officials, to make recommendations on the development of broadcasting in Kenya. The Government has drawn up its plans for the future of broadcasting in Kenya on the basis of the Commission's Report and these plans have now been largely implemented with the establishment in 1958 of a Department of Broadcasting, known as the Kenya Broadcasting Service, which took over all the African Services from 1st July 1959 and the English and Asian Services from Cable and Wireless, Ltd., from 1st October 1959.

The Kenya Broadcasting Service provides the following separate services:

(i) English National Service, broadcasting in English from Nairobi for 91 hours per week, on both short and medium wave VHF/FM;

(ii) Asian National Service, broadcasting in six Asian languages from Nairobi for 68 hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(iii) African National Service, broadcasting in Swahili and English, from Nairobi for 67½ hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(iv) Nairobi Regional Service, broadcasting in Somali, Kikamba, Kikuyu, Kimeru, Masai and Swahili from Nairobi, for 32 hours per week;

(v) West Regional Station, broadcasting in Luo, Kisii, Kalenjin, Luhya, Swahili and English, from Kisumu, for 62 hours per week on short and medium wave;

(vi) Coast Regional Station, broadcasting in Swahili and Arabic from Mombasa, for 58 hours per week, on medium wave only.

The Kenya Broadcasting Service also has a Commercial Service in which advertisements and sponsored programmes are broadcast in the English, Hindustani and Swahili languages.

In the English Service a period of 11½ hrs. per week is at present used for this Service, 8½ hrs. per week for the Asian Service and 11 hrs. per week for the African Service. On the 22nd September 1961, a Bill was prepared making provision for the establishment of the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation to take the place of the Kenya Broadcasting Service. This Bill is to cover future broadcasting and television in Kenya. All the undertaking assets and liabilities of the Kenya Broadcasting Service are to be vested in the Corporation on a date to be fixed by the Governor.

Once this Bill has been enacted, the Corporation will be controlled and governed by a Board which will be independent of the Government.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and
Rudolf Lakes. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1960 are shown in the following table:

|                      | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|----------------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing | 269,077 | 836    | 1,848     |
| Mining and Quarrying | 4,817   | 181    | 38        |
| Manufacturing and Repairs | 42,614  | 6,955  | 2,764     |
| Building and Construction | 18,234  | 2,359  | 987       |
| Electric Light, Power and Water Supply | 1,876   | 339    | 287       |
| Commerce             | 24,542  | 10,532 | 3,951     |
| Transport and Communications | 11,500  | 2,189  | 1,056     |
| Domestic Service     | 24,952  | 139    | 61        |
| Public Services (including Railways) | 140,703 | 11,809 | 8,922     |
| Other Services       | 22,567  | 2,925  | 3,380     |
| All Industries and Services | 560,882 | 38,264 | 23,007    |

In December 1959, 42 employees' and 10 employers' unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total paid-up membership of employees' unions, as shown on the 1959 returns, is 46,000. The membership claimed is considerably higher than that figure.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, sodium carbonate, meat, butter, ghee and cheese, hides and skins, maize, wheat and cotton.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as *Podocarpus* and East African pencil cedar and various hardwoods, of which East African olive and East African camphor are those in greatest demand. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and supplied 23% of the total sales of logs from the Forest Estate during 1960 but there are signs that a general decline is likely. It is too early yet to forecast whether attempts to foster an export trade in charcoal will succeed.

The annual catch in the Kenya waters of Lake Victoria has now declined to some 4,000 tons of wet fish. The marine fisheries in 1960 produced an estimated 4,250 tons of wet fish worth £166,000 to the fishermen. This yield can be expected to increase steadily in step with the local demand for sea fish.

In 1960 the chief minerals in order of value were cement, soda ash, copper, salt, limestone (other than for cement), refined gold, diatomite, carbon dioxide (natural), graphite and kyanite. The total value of minerals won during 1960 was £5,099,513.

There are in operation in the Colony over 130 main types of manufacturing and industrial concerns which produce goods both for internal consumption and export. There has been a steady rise in the export of Kenya's products, which, over the past five years, have increased by more than 20% in value to £35 million in 1960. The main items of export in 1960 were coffee, sisal, tea, pyrethrum, meat and meat preparations, hides and skins and soda ash. Two cement factories, in addition to supplying home requirements, exported more than 42,000 tons during 1960, nearly 70% more than during 1959.

(Including bullion and specie, excluding all interterritorial transfers of domestic produce to Uganda and Tanganyika.)

In 1960, 34·1% of total direct imports came from the United Kingdom, 14·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 46·6% from foreign countries; postal packages and special transactions accounted for 4·4%.

In 1960, 25·1% of domestic exports went to the United Kingdom, 19·7% to other Commonwealth countries, and 54·6% to foreign countries; 0·6% exported as ships' and aircraft stores.

Tourist Trade

Kenya's share of the East African income from tourism in 1960 is estimated at approximately £4,100,000 and so it ranks as the country's second largest "export". Visitors arriving in Kenya during 1960 totalled 35,800 and stayed an average of nearly 19 days.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

On 31st December 1960 there were 625 registered co-operative societies, with a total membership of 175,310. Of these, 546 were marketing societies, which include African, Asian and non-racial societies. There are no longer any European societies, as all these Colony-wide organisations have opened their doors to all races. The value of the produce handled by marketing societies during the year was £21,200,000 which was an increase of £1,700,000 over the previous year.
