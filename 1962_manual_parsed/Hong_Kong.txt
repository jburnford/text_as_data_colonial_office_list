HONG KONG

Area

The area of land is approximately 398½ square miles (Hong Kong Island 29 square miles, Kowloon 3½ square miles, Stonecutters Island 1 square mile, New Territories (leased) 365½ square miles). It includes all islands within a rectangular area of some 738 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory. British waters are bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

Population

The population of the Colony at the census held in March 1961 was 3,128,044, of whom the overwhelming majority are of Chinese race, many being British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. The number of Europeans and Americans permanently resident, excluding Service personnel and their families, is about 25,500, including some 16,000 British subjects from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, 1,750 Portuguese, excluding those of British nationality, and approximately 7,750 other aliens.

Principal Towns

The overwhelming majority of the population lives on Hong Kong Island or in Kowloon. The capital is Victoria, on Hong Kong Island.

The principal centres of population in the New Territories are Tsuen Wan, which has recently grown into an important industrial centre with large textile, enamel and rubber factories, iron works, etc.; Cheung Chau, a small but densely populated island, important as a market and fishing centre; Yuen Long, a mainland market town; Tai O, a fishing and market centre on Lantao Island; Tai Po and Shek Wu Hui, both mainland market towns; and Peng Chau, an island fishing port, with some industries.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with 235 adjacent islands ranging from Lantao with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside, in some parts covered with dense scrub, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.

A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain—Tai Mo Shan, 3,140 feet; Lantao Peak is 3,061 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,805 feet high.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84·76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.
History

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters Island in the harbour, Ap Lei Chau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

Constitution

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February 1917 by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, five of whom are Chinese and one Indian. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of six officials and 16 unofficials, eight of whom are elected.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).
(b) Salaries Tax.
(c) Interest Tax.
(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1961-62 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is normally only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries Tax is levied on net income from employment after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($7,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $5,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony other than in the New Territories. Effective 1961/62 the charge is at one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6¼%) if the rent receivable is in fact controlled by reference to 1941 rental but at the full standard rate (i.e. 12½%) on all other properties. However, property wholly occupied by the owner exclusively for residential purposes is exempt from Property Tax.

Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax, as is the case under Salaries Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2½% in the case of estates valued between $50,000 and $100,000, and 40% in the case of estates valued at over $15 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainments Tax, Betting Tax and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor and table waters.

- Police: $62,366,499
- Subventions: $92,916,579
- Medical: $56,573,091

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March 1961 amounted to $97,534,600 (approximately $31.18 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- 3½% Dollar Loan (1940)—$2,359,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3½% Rehabilitation Loan (1947–48)—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $16,820,793).
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$509,600.
- U.K. Government Loan for Kai Tak Airport Development—$48,000,000.

Currency

The value of the Hong Kong dollar is maintained at approximately HK $1 = 1s. 3d. sterling.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by three banks of issue: Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, The Chartered Bank and Mercantile Bank, Ltd. respectively. Subsidiary currency consisting of $1 and 1 cent notes and nickel alloy coins in denominations of $1, 50 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents are issued by the Hong Kong Government. The $1 note is gradually being withdrawn from circulation.

Development Plans

Over the next four to five years it is proposed to expend about $2,500 million on development projects, $200 million of which will be provided from the Colony's Development Loan Fund (mainly on housing), and the balance from general revenues.
The main items to be financed from revenue are as follows:

| Item                  | $ million |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| New Schools           | 120       |
| New Hospitals and Clinics | 150     |
| Public Amenities      | 50        |

**Education**

In 1961 education was provided in 1,864 schools for over 603,000 pupils. This figure represents approximately one in five of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Primary: 442,500
- Secondary: 87,300
- Post-secondary: 14,500
- Other types of Education: 59,500

Private schools provided places for some 334,800 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 178,900; while 103 Government institutions catered for 90,000. In 1960 there were about 1,900 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies, including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $115 million as compared with $24 million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

The University of Hong Kong has 1,264 students in the following faculties—arts, science, medicine, engineering and architecture. The annual Government grant to the University totalled $8.3 million for 1960–61.

**Libraries**

Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council library and a small educational library at the Education Department. Various clubs have well-stocked libraries for the use of their members.

**Medical and Health**

The Health division of the Medical and Health Department undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and the inspection and treatment of school children. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work.

The Government maintains and operates fourteen general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to ten other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony nine private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups (as on 31st March 1961) are 2,432, 3,729 and 1,150 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1960 totalled over 132,000 and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were just over 865,800. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

The general state of health is good; there was no recurrence in epidemic form of influenza during 1960, but a total of 5,727 notifications was recorded.

The most serious scourge is tuberculosis; 12,425 cases were notified in 1960 with 16.8% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned over 3,280 deaths; infant mortality was 41.5 per 1,000 live births.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1960–61 amounted to approximately $78.5 million, compared with $64.9 million in the previous year.

Capital expenditure on medical projects under the Public Works Non-Recurrent head accounted for another $12.4 million.

**Communications**

**Air.**—Hong Kong (Kai Tak) Airport with its new 8,350 feet of runway continues to expand its role in air travel. Since the opening of the runway in September 1958 together with its modern airport lighting system, regularity of aircraft movements has improved considerably. An instrument landing system, together with precision approach radar and long and medium range surveillance radar, has been installed and is operating most successfully and being used continually by airlines.

The increase of air traffic is maintained, both aircraft and passenger handling being higher than the previous year. The principal aircraft types are now Boeing 707 and 720, Comet, Convair 880, Britannia, Viscount and Electra. During 1960, 12,221 international flights by commercial aircraft carried 451,487 passengers, 4,930.7 tons of freight and 1,387.6 tons of mail, in addition to transit traffic.

**Rail.**—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1960 amounted to 355,860 metric tons and 5,891,040 passengers were carried.

**Roads.**—There are 515.5 miles of roadway, 97.44% of which is of metalled construction.

**Shipping.**—37,485 vessels entered and cleared during 1960–61, their net registered tonnage being 37,444,474; 1,162,147 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. Frequent ferry services cross the harbour and link the principal islands to the westward.

**Sound and Television Broadcasting**

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW) and VHF/FM (5 kW) from two separate stations, in English and four Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 120,151 licence holders at the end of 1960. Rediffusion (Hong Kong), Limited, operate a wired broadcasting service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1960 there were some 44,681 subscribers to the service. Rediffusion Limited also operate a wired television service. A commercial broadcasting organization, the
Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Co., Ltd., transmits programmes on medium wave (1 kW) in English and two Chinese dialects.

**Principal Occupations**

Before the war, most of the urban population was engaged in commerce, but since 1948 there has been a significant growth of local industries. In June 1961 there were 236,734 workers in 6,072 registered and recorded factories and workshops; 100,714 of them were women. Another 150,000 people are estimated to be employed in smaller cottage-type industries and as outworkers. Reliable statistics of unemployment and under-employment are not obtainable; employment is liable to fluctuation during any year. Few rural families live entirely off the land, farmers' budgets being supplemented by remittances from family members overseas or working in urban jobs in Hong Kong and Kowloon. There is a large fishing population, most of which lives permanently afloat.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are twenty-two Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies with a membership of more than 7,500. Twenty-one of these Societies have formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition, two Irrigation Societies, four Salaried Workers’ Thrift and Loan Societies, seven Consumers’ and Credit Societies, one Fish Pond Society, 162 Housing Societies, seven Agricultural Credit Societies, four Better Living Societies and 42 Pig Raising Societies have been formed. The last named have also federated and formed a Federation of Pig Raising Societies. Fishermen are becoming more aware of the benefits of co-operation and there are 43 Fishermen’s Thrift and Loan Societies, one Fishermen’s Thrift Society, one Fishermen’s Credit and Marketing Society and two Fishermen’s Thrift, Loan and Housing Societies. Forty-one Fishermen’s Co-operative Societies have formed themselves into four Federations. The total number of members of Co-operative Societies is more than 17,000.

The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market in Kowloon from co-operative societies, collecting centres and depots in the New Territories. The collecting centres which are run by the farmers have, with the exception of two centres, now developed into co-operative societies.

Five Wholesale Fish Markets are operated by the Fish Marketing Organization. A revolving loan fund with a present ceiling of $1,000,000 has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; over $7,670,000 has been loaned from it. The Organization also operates schools for fishermen’s children and provides education for more than 2,600 students.
