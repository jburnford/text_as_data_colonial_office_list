**UGANDA**

**Area**

The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles (Northern Province 28,898, Buganda 25,631, Eastern Province 25,607, Western Province 13,845) of which 13,689 square miles are water and swamp.

**Population**

The estimated total population of the Protectorate at 30th June 1960 was 6,682,000.

The total non-African population as shown by the 1959 census was 87,058, made up as follows:

- Indians: 63,130
- Pakistanis: 5,973
- Goans: 2,830
- Arabs: 1,946
- Europeans: 10,866
- Others: 2,313

The total African population in the 1959 Census was 6,449,558 compared with 4,917,555 in 1948.

**Principal Towns**

The principal towns are Entebbe (seat of the Governor and the Central Government, population about 11,000), Kampala (commercial capital, population nearing 50,000), Jinja (population about 30,000), Mbale (population about 13,000). Apart from these, the main towns which are both administrative and commercial centres are Tororo, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale and Mubende, the population of none of which exceeds 11,000. There are some 75 other towns in the country as well as numerous Trading Centres. Adjacent to Kampala, but under the control of H.H. the Kabaka's Government is the urban area of the Kibuga, with a population of about 50,000.

**Geographical Features**

The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,030 feet at Lake Albert and below 2,000 feet in the valley of the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Mufumbiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,540 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margherita (16,763 feet) and Alexandra (16,703 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasiens (10,074 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, the Aswa and the Malawa. The total area of forest is approximately 2,900 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.
Climate

The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° F. and 75° F., but is lower in the highlands of the west and south-west. In the Entebbe/Kampala area (approximately 3,700 feet above sea level) the mean annual temperature is 71° F., the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures are 79° F. and 63° F. respectively. The average rainfall varies from 30 to 60 inches according to the area. The rainy seasons are not clearly defined and vary from one long season from April to September in the extreme north to two seasons March to May and September to November at the Equator.

History

In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa’s dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company’s influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga’s kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga’s kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1899 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and in 1900 concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. Agreements were also made in 1900 with the ruler and chiefs of Toro and in 1901 with the ruler and chiefs of Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes and the same principles of “indirect rule” were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1902 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate’s affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

Constitution

The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, as amended in 1961, provides that there should be a Council of Ministers and Legislative Council consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions. Changes in the structure of these Councils took place during 1961. As a result, the Council of Ministers consists of 15 members (the Governor as President, the Deputy Governor, 3 ex-officio members and 10 nominated members, who are Ministers). The nominated members are drawn from the political party holding a majority in the Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council consists of 101 members and is presided over by the Speaker. The members are made up of 3 ex-officio members, 82 directly elected members, 9 specially elected members and 7 nominated members. A General Election for the 82 representative members’ seats was held in March 1961. This resulted in a victory for the Democratic Party, which obtained 44 of the 82 seats. The Opposition party—the Uganda Peoples Congress—obtained 35 seats. Of the 101 members, there are 88 Africans, 8 Europeans and 5 Asians.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the others owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 and the Buganda Agreement, 1955, by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka, acting as a constitutional ruler, with the advice of six Ministers. A hierarchy of appointed chiefs are the executive officers of government. The Great Lukiko (i.e. the council of Buganda) contains 89 members of whom 40 are elected indirectly and 20 are elected by the county councils.

In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces African Administrations have been established under the African Local Governments Ordinance 1949 and the District Administration (District Councils) Ordinance 1955, with district councils as the most important organs. Most of these councils have a majority of members who are elected, either directly or through lower councils. The latter have been established in most districts at parish, sub-county and county levels; they have as yet few specific functions. All District Councils have as their principal executive officers elected or appointed Secretaries-General and Treasurers, and in all districts there is a hierarchy of appointed chiefs as the executive officers of local government. In the Agreement districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro there are traditional hereditary Rulers whose positions are defined in the Agreements.

Land Policy

Approximately 10,000 square miles of land is registered as being in private ownership of Africans, mainly in Buganda and Western Province. Approximately 440 square miles is in non-African hands. The remainder of the land in the Territory is vested in the Crown in trust for the use and benefit of the African population.
townships and in Buganda province Africans may only occupy such land in accordance with a lease or licence; elsewhere they may occupy it without lease or licence according to native custom. It is Government's policy to issue freehold titles to Africans occupying Crown land by native custom where the demand for such titles is shown to exist. No further grants in freehold are made to non-Africans and alienations by lease are given only after consultation with the African Local Government concerned. African-owned land may not be transferred to non-Africans without the consent of the Minister of Land and Water Resources.

The above policy, particularly in regard to the control of Crown land, will be altered in the near future in the light of decisions reached at the Constitutional Conference held in London in September 1961.

Taxation

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll tax, export taxes, stamp duties, and Customs and excise duties.

Income Tax is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from or received in East Africa by residents after any personal allowances have been deducted, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents. There is provision for double taxation relief between Uganda and the United Kingdom, Canada, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Denmark and Sweden. Any person liable to pay African poll tax is exempt from paying income tax.

Poll Tax is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of Sh. 6/- per year throughout the Protectorate. An African Authority Tax is levied by African authorities varying up to £30 according to district and capacity to pay. Non-African Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £7 10/- on taxpayers whose income exceeds £200 per annum and £3 15/- on taxpayers with lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

Export Taxes are levied on lint cotton, coffee and hides and skins on a sliding scale by value.

Companies Tax. The rate of Income Tax applicable to companies is Shs. 5/50 on every £ of income accrued in, derived from or received in the Protectorate. Non-resident companies are assessed on income accrued in or derived from the Protectorate. A special rate of Shs. 9/50 in the £ is charged on the undistributed profits of companies which are resident in the Protectorate and in which the public are not substantially interested. This rate applies to the total income of the company less an allowance of 32½% of the trading income and any dividends declared out of such profits.

Customs and Excise. The tariff is divided into ad valorem, specific and free goods. Ad valorem duties vary from 12½% to 66½%, the latter assessment applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations and to extracts used in the manufacture of mineral waters. The basic rate of import duty is 25% ad valorem. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer, wine and matches.

Currency

The currency is under the control of the East African Currency Board in Nairobi. The unit of currency is the shilling, which is sub-divided
into 100 cents. Coins and notes of the following denominations circulate in Uganda:

Coins: 1/-, 50 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent.

Notes: 5/-, 10/-, 20/-, 100/-, and 200/-.

Shs. 1,000/- and 10,000/- notes are used only for transactions between the Banks and the Currency Board and are not in general circulation.

Development Plans

Provision has been made for Capital Expenditure during 1961-62 totalling £5,632,005.

This sum is broken down into the following categories:

| Category          | £       |
|-------------------|---------|
| Administration    | 218,370 |
| Urban Development | 469,720 |
| Social Services   | 1,150,550|
| Economic Services | 2,454,480|
| Law and Order     | 702,420 |
| Unallocable       | 636,465 |

The Three-Year Capital Expenditure Forecast published in 1960 has been rendered largely out of date as a result of the findings of the World Bank Economic Survey Mission to Uganda. When the latter's final report is received a new Five Year Development Plan will be framed, and it is hoped, published early in 1962.

Other Development

The Uganda Development Corporation Limited was established by Government in 1952 with an authorized capital of £8,000,000 (£6,400,000 issued). The Corporation's purpose is to facilitate the industrial and economic development of the Protectorate by promoting and assisting in the financing, management or establishment of new undertakings wherever possible in conjunction with private enterprise and of schemes for the better organization, modernization or efficient carrying out of any undertaking. It has altogether 26 associate and subsidiary companies. The latter include the Uganda Cement Industry Limited, Uganda Hotels Limited, Agricultural Enterprises Limited, Uganda Metal Products and Enamelling Company Limited and Nyanza Textile Industries Limited, which produces cloth from locally grown cotton.

The Corporation is associated in other enterprises engaged in the development of mining and manufactures. One of these, Kilembe Mines Limited, is producing copper from deposits in Western Uganda, and smelting it at Jinja prior to export. Another, Tororo Industrial Chemical and Fertilisers Limited has been formed to develop the mineral deposits at Sukulu, near Tororo, which consist principally of apatite, magnetite and pyrochlore.

The Uganda Credit and Savings Bank was established in 1950 to make available to Africans facilities for loans for agricultural and commercial purposes; initial capital was provided by the Uganda Government.

At 30th June 1961 deposits in the Savings Bank Section amounted to over £1,480,000 in over 50,000 accounts; 450 loan accounts were open at this date with outstanding balances of over £458,000. There are eight Branches of the Bank and three Agencies established in up-country centres. The Bank also acts as agent in operating the African Loans Fund (for making loans to Africans whose credit-worthiness relies more on guarantees by local Governments than on the normal security required by the Bank) and the Revolving Loan Fund of the International Cooperation Administration.

The Uganda Electricity Board, a public utility corporation, is pressing forward with extensions to the distribution of electricity supplies which are obtained mainly from the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja where there is an installed capacity of 105,000 kW and which is capable of expansion to provide 150,000 kW. It is estimated that there is an additional potential output of some 500,000 kW in the 19-mile stretch of the river Nile below Owen Falls, and even more than this amount on the reach of the Nile between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert.

Education

The number of children at school in Uganda increased by almost two-and-a-half times in the decade 1950–60. In 1960 there were 237,447 boys and 108,387 girls attending the 2,249 grant-aided primary schools, and 17,806 boys and 4,131 girls at the 244 grant-aided secondary schools. 4,348 boys were enrolled at the 92 grant-aided technical schools, and in addition to these there were 34 Teacher Training Colleges with 2,140 boys and 1,042 girls.

The University College of East Africa is at Makerere (Kampala) and is an autonomous institution catering for all the East African territories. Since 1953 the College has, in special relationship with London University, awarded degrees to its students. In 1960 there were 912 students attending the College of whom 279 were from Uganda. In the same year there were 509 Uganda students attending courses overseas in the United Kingdom, India, the United States and elsewhere. Of this total 334 were African. Most of the African students are supported by scholarships or bursaries from various sources. The East African Governments are presently considering the establishment of a University of East Africa.

The total recurrent expenditure by the Protectorate Government on all types of education, in the financial year 1959–60 was £4,307,066. Capital expenditure totalled £421,156.

Libraries and Museums, etc.

Makerere College has the largest library in East Africa, consisting of 46,000 volumes and 44,000 pamphlets and unbound parts, and is the territory's official deposit library. Kampala Municipal Council runs a public library in Kampala, and both the British Council and the United States Information Services also have libraries in Kampala. There is a British Council branch library in their Mbale regional office and a Uganda Literature and Libraries Service has been formed to encourage the establishment of libraries in other district Headquarters. The Uganda Museum (Kampala) was established fifty years ago, and displays mainly ethnographic and archaeological material.

Health

The most common causes of illness are respiratory diseases, malaria and other fevers, injuries, diseases of the digestive system, venereal diseases and diseases of the eye.

A total of 492 beds are available for tuberculosis patients at Mulago and district hospitals. After about three months hospitalisation, most tuberculosis patients can continue their treatment as
out-patients. In 1960 2,534 new cases of tuberculosis were notified. The position in regard to leprosy control remained largely as previously. There are five major Mission leprosy centres and 85 treatment villages maintained by African Local Governments. At June 1960 there were 30,605 lepers under treatment.

At Mulago Hospital, which is the teaching hospital for Makerere Medical School, there are 670 beds. This hospital together with the 28 district Government hospitals provide a total of 3,886 beds of which 538 are for maternity patients. Missions, private Nursing Homes and Industry provide in addition 1,522 general and 1,243 maternity beds.

The period covered by annual reports having changed from the calendar to the fiscal year, hospital attendance figures are available only from the 1st January to 30th June 1960. In-patients at Government hospitals for this period numbered 58,662 and out-patients 759,006. At Government dispensaries 1,408,576 out-patients received treatment and 43,476 patients were admitted.

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1959–60 totalled £2,104,359 as against £1,895,103 in 1958–59.

Communications

At Entebbe there is a first-class international airport with a main runway capable of receiving all commercial aircraft now flying or likely to fly through Entebbe in the foreseeable future. The Airport is equipped with the latest navigational aids, and the safety services are of a high standard. The main trunk route operators use Entebbe, which has excellent flying weather throughout the year, and in addition charter companies and the Royal Air Force make use of the Airport. It is estimated that about 90,000 passengers used the airport during 1960.

Secondary airfields are maintained by the Uganda Government at Kasese, Jinja, Tororo, Soroti, Gulu, Arua, Paraa, Masindi, Lira, Mbarara and Moroto, the first seven of which are served on regular schedules by the East African Airways Corporation.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East African Common Services Organization").

The direct line from the coast runs westwards across the Protectorate through Tororo, Jinja and Kampala to Kasese near the Congo border. A branch line from Tororo serves Mbale and Soroti, and was extended during 1961 to Lira. Another line northwards from Jinja connects at Namasagali with a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga to Masindi Port. The Railways Administration operates a road transport service between Masindi Port and Butiaba on Lake Albert, and a steamer service on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule which is connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan. Another steamer service operates between Butiaba and the Congo ports of Mahagi and Kasenyi on the west shore of Lake Albert. A through service is thus provided by the Railways Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Congo. In addition regular steamer services connect Port Bell, Entebbe and Bukakata on Lake Victoria with Kisumu and Tanganyika ports.

The Ministry of Works maintains 606 miles of tarmac road and 2,383 miles of all-weather murram roads connecting the principal towns; the various African Local Governments between them maintain a further 4,418 miles of all-weather murram roads and 3,882 miles of lesser murram roads of variable standard.

Broadcasting

The Uganda Broadcasting Service commenced regular transmission on 1st March 1954 and now broadcasts daily in English, Luganda, Runyoro, Lwo and Atezo and weekly in Runyankore, Lugbara and Hindustani. It operates on frequencies of 5,026 and 9,590 kc/s in the 60 and 31 metre bands respectively and also on 971 kc/s and 548 kc/s in the medium wave band. Each of the medium wave channels is powered by two ¼ kW transmitters operating in parallel; the short wave channel is powered by a 7½ kW transmitter. The transmitters are situated at Bugolobi near Kampala. Permanent studios are situated in Kampala.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle-raising on their own account. The numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in the principal industries and occupations in June 1960 were:

| Industry                                      | Number |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture                                   | 49,366 |
| Government Service (Administrative)           | 14,568 |
| African Local Governments                    | 34,469 |
| Cotton Ginning                                | 4,030  |
| Coffee Curing                                 | 2,820  |
| Forestry, Fishing and Hunting                 | 3,600  |
| Transport and Communications                  | 10,105 |
| Wholesale and Retail Trade                    | 9,342  |
| Manufactures, including Electricity           | 24,575 |
| Mining and Quarrying                          | 5,322  |
| Building and Construction                     | 29,204 |
| Education and Medical Services                | 25,171 |
| Other Services                                | 16,317 |

Total: 228,889

The foregoing figures are based on a census covering all employers except domestic service and peasant agriculture. The estimated total numbers in employment, including domestic service and peasant agriculture, are 340,000 Africans, 10,600 Asians and 5,000 Europeans.

There are 35 registered trade unions with a book membership of approximately 20,000 and 12 associations of employees with a total membership of about 9,400. Joint staff committees of works councils have been introduced in 148 establishments.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), sugar, tea, tobacco, millets, maize, plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava and groundnuts.

The number of cattle sold in established markets in 1960 was 149,226, while the total number consumed exceeded 620,000. Hides and skins form an important export, valued at £1,146,115 in 1960.
Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hard-woods, but more than 6,000 acres of softwood timber plantations are being created annually. The greater part of the timber production is consumed in the Protectorate and in the adjoining East African territories, but a small and increasing proportion is exported mainly to Great Britain. During 1958 about 1½ million cubic feet of sawn timber of an estimated value of about £1,000,000 were produced and a plywood industry is now well established.

Copper is the chief metal produced, and in 1960 there was an increased output of blister copper of which 14,713 tons, worth £3,689,458, were exported. Production of wolfram, which had virtually ceased, began again under the incentive of more favourable prices and continued to improve in 1960. Quantities of tin, beryl, lead concentrates, apatite, bismuth, gold, niobium and tantalum were produced. Exports of tin and lead concentrates, beryl and bismuth were at a higher level than in 1958. Geological survey work and mineral prospecting continues.

The fishing industry is of great importance, and expanding. The present production is approximately 55,000 tons of fish per year, worth over £2 million, and of this over 10,000 tons are exported.

The Uganda Cement Industry at Tororo has an annual capacity of 150,000 tons, more than sufficient to meet local consumption of cement. The textile factory at Jinja produces cloth from locally grown cotton. Annual output on three-shift production is at the rate of 13 million yards of various types of cloth—greys, drills and dyes. A £1,000,000 expansion programme was started at the end of 1959. A factory for the production of all types of plywood including marine and tea chests was opened at Jinja in 1959. In the 1960 season 130 cotton ginneries were in operation. The coffee crop was processed by 12 curing works and 7 licensed millers; 29 estate coffee factories operated by associations of African growers and 60 estate coffee factories operated by non-Africans. Amongst other undertakings processing agricultural produce were two sugar factories, one tobacco-processing plant, and a large number of maize mills and oil-expressing mills.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. The Lint Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of the lint cotton and seed and the Coffee Marketing Board for the coffee crop (excepting the Bigisu arabica crop and the produce of estates and associations of African growers permitted to conduct their own sales). Producer prices are announced before the marketing season opens and it is also the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time.

The co-operative movement of Uganda, constituted and regulated under the provisions of the Co-operative Societies Ordinance 1946, is made up at the present time of sixteen marketing and processing unions, of some 1,700 primary societies, of which all but a few are producers' societies, and of the Uganda Co-operative Alliance Ltd., which represents all unions and societies and has education and publicity as its main objects. At the end of 1960 membership of the primary societies was 211,214 and the combined turnover of the unions and primary societies amounted, during the year, to £13,173,746.

The main crops marketed and processed co-operatively were cotton and coffee. In 1960 the thirteen co-operative ginneries ginned 58,567 bales, or 16% of the Protectorate total, and five co-operative coffee factories processed 24,414 tons of clean coffee; the whole of the Bigisu arabica coffee crop being marketed and processed co-operatively.

The Government has inaugurated a pilot scheme which, to begin with, will be financed by the Uganda Credit and Savings Bank, for the provision of credit through co-operative societies. An apex co-operative trading organisation, with the unions as members, is in the process of formation.

The Department of Co-operative Development carries out the functions of developing, supervising and guiding co-operatives, auditing the accounts of the primary societies and training office bearers and members.

At 30th June 1960, the assets of the Cotton Price Assistance Fund amounted to £16,058,174 and those of the Coffee Price Assistance Fund were £11,183,112.
