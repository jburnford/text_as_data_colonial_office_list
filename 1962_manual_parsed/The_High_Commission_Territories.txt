THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES
(BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE AND SWAZILAND)

Basutoland (a Colony), the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland (also a Protectorate), are administered on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom by a High Commissioner. Each territory is administered on his behalf by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners. Since the advent of the South African Republic in May 1961 the High Commissioner has also held the office of British Ambassador to South Africa.
