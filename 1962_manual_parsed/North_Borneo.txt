NORTH BORNEO

Area

North Borneo, which includes the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo, is 29,388 square miles in area or roughly the size of Ireland. It is divided into four Residencies: Sandakan, 9,534 square miles; Tawau, 7,011 square miles; Interior, 7,613 square miles and West Coast...
5,195 square miles. Since October 1955 Labuan Island, 35 square miles, has been administered by a District Officer who is responsible directly to the Chief Secretary, Jesselton.

**Population**

(Census of 9th/10th August 1960):

| Indigenous | 309,833 |
| Chinese    | 104,855 |
| European (including Eurasian) | 1,807 |
| Others     | 37,833 |
| **Total**  | **454,328** |

**Principal Towns**

All are situated on the coast and have good harbours:

**Geographical Features**

Central mountain ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in height, rise somewhat sharply from low hills nearer the coast and culminate in Mount Kinabalu (13,455 feet) the highest mountain in the East Indies. The coastline is formed mainly of alluvial flats, with many creeks and swamps. Hills and valleys in most cases are covered with dense forest and there are many rivers. The most extensive plain is that on the east coast, irrigated by the river Kinabatangan and its tributaries, and believed to contain some 4,000 square miles of rich and fertile soil. In the interior are found the Keningau and Tambunan plains which are traversed by the Pegalan River. The Keningau plain consists of wide stretches of grassland, while Tambunan maintains a large padi-planting population.

Labuan, 35 square miles in area, is an island lying six miles off the mainland. It has an excellent, well-sheltered harbour and during 1956 regained its pre-war status as a free port.

**Climate**

This is relatively cool for a place situated so near the equator.

| Mean Maximum Temperatures (°C) | Mean Minimum Temperatures (°C) | Rainfall (inches) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Jesselton                     | 86·8°                          | 74·0°            | 104·26           |
| Sandakan                      | 87·6°                          | 73·4°            | 127·22           |

Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively dry belts. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and lasts until March or April; the south-west monsoon prevails from the beginning of May until August. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt.

**History**

Early in the sixteenth century the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the bulk of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. The Sultan of Brunei offered the island of Labuan to the British Government in 1844 and in accordance with that offer the island was annexed in 1846, the cession being formally agreed to in a treaty with the Sultan in 1847. In 1878, after protracted negotiations, a large area on the mainland was ceded by the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory and was made in perpetuity. In November 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Limited, which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882. This Company governed British North Borneo until January 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September 1945 and was under military administration until 15th July 1946 when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new Colony of North Borneo on the same date under the Labuan Order in Council.

**Constitution**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent under which a Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony is appointed. Under this Instrument all sovereign rights were assumed over the former state of North Borneo and the Settlement of Labuan following the respective North Borneo and Labuan Cession Orders in Council of 1946.

Legislative and Executive Council, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto, were provided for in 1950 by amending Letters Patent. This Legislative Council was established by Order in Council in 1950 and its constitution was varied by an amending Order in Council in 1960. The Legislative Council now consists of the Governor as President, four *ex officio* members, three official members and twelve nominated members. The Constitution of the Executive Council, which is fixed by Royal Instructions, is now four *ex officio* members, one official member and five nominated members.

Further amending constitutional instruments were approved in December 1961. They provide for the appointment of six more nominated members to the Legislative Council and two more members, one official and one nominated, to the Executive Council. It was hoped that these changes would be introduced at the beginning of 1962.
Federation of Malaysia

Following talks in London in November 1961 the Prime Ministers of Britain and the Federation of Malaya issued a joint statement agreeing that the creation of a Federation of Malaysia, which would embrace the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei, was a desirable aim. The text of the statement has been published by the British Government as a White Paper (Cmnd. 1563).

It was agreed that before coming to a final decision it would be necessary to ascertain the views of the people of North Borneo and Sarawak and it was decided to set up a Commission to carry out this task and make recommendations. The Commission was expected to visit the territories in February and March 1962.

Land Policy

There are two forms of land tenure: leases available to all, and Native Titles available to natives (who include all indigenous inhabitants). No new lease for town or country land (not being a Native Title) may be for more than 99 years. The area opened up by natives (excluding village reserves) is approximately 150,525 acres, almost all on individual title. All unalienated land is the property of the Crown.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The rate applicable to companies, incorporated or registered in the Colony or elsewhere, is as follows:

(a) if they elect to be taxed on undistributed exempt trading profit.. 20%
Provided when these profits are distributed a further 20% has to be paid.

(b) on all other chargeable income .. 40%

The rates applicable to individuals are from 3½% on the first $12,000 of chargeable income to 20% on chargeable income in excess of $52,000. Arrangements have been concluded with the Governments of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation.

The other main source of taxation is Customs import and export duties. The highest general rate on imports is 30% ad valorem on cosmetics and perfumery, the preferential rate being 20%. Manufactured goods are usually charged 10%, but many items are subject to specific duty rates including, so far as possible, textiles and clothing. Other textiles and clothing are charged 15% with a preferential rate of 7½%. The free list includes essential footstuffs, building materials and passengers' personal and household effects. Essential machinery and plant of British manufacture is also free of duty. The majority of goods exported are dutiable; 10% of the f.o.b. value is an average charge, but certain items are given special attention, e.g., rubber is charged 5% ad valorem when the fixed price does not exceed 60 cents per pound, and on an increasing scale as the fixed price rises, e.g., with fixed price at $1.50 per pound the duty is 17 cents. In fixing the price an allowance of 5 cents per pound against the average Singapore buying price is made. In addition, cesses are levied on all rubber exported; ½ cent per pound for the development of the rubber industry, and 3½% of the price at the date of export subject to a minimum of 2 cents per pound to finance replanting and new planting by estates and smallholders. Most of the timber exported is charged a royalty, but other timber is charged export duty in accordance with the Timber Roll.

To encourage the cultivation of certain crops exemption from export duty has been granted as follows:

- **Manila hemp** (Abaca) 5% ad valorem only is payable on hemp exported before 1st January 1962.
- **Cocoa** Exemption from export duty up to 1st January 1967.
- **Palm Oil and Palm Kernels** Exemption from export duty up to 1st January 1973.

Public Finance

From the re-establishment of civil government, following the liberation from Japanese occupation in July 1946, to the end of 1960 local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure.

| Year | Revenue(a) | Expenditure(b) |
|------|------------|---------------|
| 1956 | $33,739,427 | $32,498,979   |
| 1957 | $35,462,769 | $35,259,307(c)|
| 1958 | $37,583,797 | $36,659,851(c)|

- Harbours: $1,266,615
- Medical: $364,839

The total of the Public Debt at 31st December 1960 was $35,366,041.

Currency

The currency in circulation in North Borneo is Malayan currency consisting of:

(a) currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, dated not earlier than 1st July 1941 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents; and $1, $5, $10, $50, $100, $1,000. Of the above, the notes of denominations of from one to fifty cents are being withdrawn from circulation as and when handed into treasuries but they are still legal tender;

(b) silver coins in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 cents, which are being withdrawn from circulation;

(c) cupro-nickel coins in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents;

(d) copper and bronze coins in denominations of one cent.

British Borneo (Chartered) Company currency ceased to be legal tender as from 1st September 1953 but when handed into banks or treasuries is still redeemable at its face value for Malayan currency.

The amount of currency estimated as being in circulation at the end of 1960 was $102,635,889.

The buying and selling rates of the Malayan dollar fluctuate slightly in accordance with the Singapore market, but for the purpose of converting it into sterling, the value of the dollar is taken as 2s. 4d.

Development Plans

In the course of 1959, a broad disposition of the Colony's Development Finance for the period 1959 to 1964 was drawn up. It has since been possible to make available a further $17,000,000, making a total of $78,000,000 for the current development period. The Plan assumes that finance can be found from:

(a) Allocations of surplus Colony Funds: $40,000,000
(b) Loan Funds: $10,000,000
(c) Unspent balances from Colonial Development and Welfare grants from the period ending 31st March 1960 (say): $260,000
(d) Colonial Development and Welfare grants of £3,000,000 ($25,714,265): $25,714,265
(e) Accruals from land premia between 1961 and 1964 (say): $2,000,000

$77,974,265

(say) $78,000,000

The Plan proposes the sum of $78,000,000 should be allocated on the following broad lines:

- Roads: $21,800,000
- Harbours and Marine: $6,995,000
- Civil Aviation: $2,584,750
- Agriculture: $1,251,000
- Drainage, Irrigation and Reclamation: $2,000,000
- Medical: $2,424,000
- Education: $6,035,000
- Credit: $2,000,000
- Buildings and Miscellaneous: $18,160,000
- Water supplies: $4,650,000
- Sewerage: $1,500,000
- Posts and Telegraphs: $990,000
- Land: $250,000
- Broadcasting and Information: $1,000,000
- Railways: $1,000,000
- Training: $698,000
- Miscellaneous Unallocated: $4,662,250

$78,000,000

In addition a sum of $10,000,000 has been allocated to a contingencies item which is intended to cover the possibility that government may ultimately have to find funds to supply credit to certain statutory bodies in excess of $2,000,000 shown against credit facilities and to increase certain allocations which are likely to prove inadequate.

Education

There are 90 Government and 265 grant-aided primary schools and 5 Government and 20 grant-aided secondary schools. 31 of the grant-aided schools are maintained by Local Authorities which, in 1960, raised $179,932-69 towards their maintenance. Government also maintains a Trade School and a Teachers' Training College and conducts a number of Adult Evening Classes in science and languages.

Primary education is provided in Malay, Chinese, English and, to a small extent, in Kadazan, the language of the largest indigenous community. Secondary education is provided principally in English and Chinese.

The Government Secondary School in Jesselton is the only school at present providing a post-certificate course to university matriculation standard, with a main bias towards science. Six of the secondary schools provide a full course to Overseas School Certificate, two Chinese schools provide a six-year secondary course and all other secondary schools at present provide a short three-year course toward a local certificate.

In 1960 the enrolment in primary schools was Malay, 15,818; Chinese, 20,233; and English, 10,906. There were 2,622 pupils in English secondary schools and 1,184 in Chinese secondary schools.

The expenditure by the Education Department from Colony funds on education was $3,618,412 in 1960.

Libraries

There is a reference library in the Secretariat and reference and lending libraries are maintained at the headquarters of the Education
Department and at the Information Office, Jesselton. The Information Office has organized branch libraries in Sandakan, Tawau and four other small towns.

**Health**

The principal diseases are malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute respiratory disease, bowel infections and skin complaints. There are two general hospitals (511 beds); five cottage hospitals (485 beds); and 12 dispensaries (186 beds). There are also 18 dispensaries situated in outlying districts staffed by Senior Dressers under the supervision of District Medical Officers. In 1960 out-patients numbered 321,608 and in-patients 20,296.

There is a mental hospital at Sandakan with 160 beds.

There are Health Centres in Sandakan and Jesselton, each under the direct supervision of a Health Visitor. At these centres, maternity and child welfare clinics are held. Subsidiary rural health clinics in the Jesselton and Sandakan districts are regularly visited by the Health Centre staff and serve the up-country villages. Native midwives are being trained at each of the main hospitals and at each Cottage Hospital.

Expenditure on medical services from Colony funds in 1960 amounted to $3,970,634.

**Communications**

There are three civil airports, situated at Jesselton, Sandakan and Labuan, that at Labuan being of international standard. Malayan Airways Ltd. provide air services between Singapore, Kuching, Sibu, Brunei, Jesselton and Sandakan, by Viscount and Dakota aircraft. An internal service linking Labuan, Keningau, Ranau, Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau and Lahad Datu is operated by Borneo Airways Ltd. using Twin Pioneer aircraft. In 1960 there were 12,862 movements of aircraft.

In 1960 708,710 passengers were carried on the railways and the weight of freight hauled was 48,560 tons. The total length of the railway, which is of metre gauge and serves the West Coast from Jesselton southwards and part of the interior, is 116 miles.

There are 233 miles of roads with bitumen-sealed surface; 80 miles of other metalled roads; and 456 miles of earth/gravel roads. Work has now started, however, on a network of roads eventually designed to connect up the main centres of population and it is anticipated that the East and West Coasts will be linked by road communications within a few years.

The chief ports of the Colony are Sandakan, Jesselton, Tawau, Labuan, Lahad Datu, Kudat and Semporna together with seven other timber-loading points and minor ports. Some thirty shipping lines run services between ports in the Colony and the Far East, Australia, Europe, South Africa and U.S.A. The coastal shipping includes some 230 vessels which handle the inter-port trade and trade with the adjacent territories of Brunei and Sarawak. In 1960, 9,512,673 gross tons of shipping used the ports of the Colony and the quantity of cargo handled was 1,860,587 tons.

**Broadcasting**

The North Borneo Broadcasting Service (Radio Sabah) was inaugurated in November 1955 and a daily 9½ hour programme is transmitted in Chinese (Kuo-yu and Hakka), Malay, Kadazan and English. The 5 kW. HF transmitter giving Colony-wide coverage and a 250 W. MF transmitter serving the Jesselton area are located at Kepayan, five miles from Jesselton. There are approximately 17,254 wireless licence holders in the Colony.

**Principal Occupations**

The estimated numbers of persons engaged in 1960 in the principal fields of economic activity were as follows:

- Smallholding Agriculture: 90,000
- Rubber Production: 20,000
- Commerce: 12,000
- Government Services: 3,500
- Fishing: 6,000
- Timber: 10,000
- Coconut, Copra and Coconut oil production: 3,000
- Transport and Communications: 3,000
- Firewood and Cutch: 2,000
- Building: 2,000

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are rubber, coconuts, rice and hemp. A high grade cigar wrapper leaf is grown for export by one large estate and a coarse variety of tobacco is cultivated as a village industry. Extensive areas for the cultivation of cocoa and oil palms are in process of being opened up.

The estimated livestock population is: pigs 100,000; buffaloes 100,000; cattle 25,000; goats 25,000; ponies 4,000; poultry 4,000,000. A cattle farm, on co-operative lines, has been established.

The total output of timber in 1960 expressed in cubic feet quarter-girth round measurement was 59,647,000 cubic feet.

Interest in fish pond production continues, 678 ponds having been constructed and stocked. The total area is 50 acres and the estimated yield of fish 20 tons. More farmers are adopting the "Monosex" method of Tilapia culture.

A geological survey is being undertaken to determine the mineral wealth of the country, mining companies are prospecting for chromite, iron ore and copper, and a large oil company is prospecting for oil.

| Year | Imports ($ million) | Exports ($ million) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1956 | 117·4               | 120·9               |
| 1957 | 121·6               | 120·9               |

| 1960 | 195·9               | 222·6               |

Original sources of imports are difficult to state on account of the territory's dependence on supplies from the entrepot markets of Singapore and Hong Kong. Similarly it is not possible to determine accurately the ultimate destination of all the Colony's exports.

During 1960 imports by countries of origin and exports by countries of destination were:

**Imports**—U.K. accounted for 20·1%, other Commonwealth countries 20·3%, Foreign coun-
Exports.—U.K. received 8·2%, other Commonwealth countries 28·0%, Foreign countries 63·8%.
