STATE OF SINGAPORE

Area
The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islets, is 224.5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 37.2 square miles.

Population of Singapore
The total population at the 1957 census was 1,445,929.

The estimated population as on 31st December 1960 was 1,665,400:
Malaysians ........................................... 232,400
Chinese .................................................. 1,253,400
Indians and Pakistanis .................................. 140,400
Europeans .................................................. 13,000
Eurasians .................................................. 12,500
Others ....................................................... 13,700

Geographical Features
The island of Singapore is connected with the mainland of the Malay peninsula by a causeway three-quarters of a mile long, carrying a road, railway and water mains.

The highest point on Singapore Island is Bukit Timah, 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Headwaters from this and two other streams have been impounded to form reservoirs.

Climate of Singapore
There are no well marked dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The average maximum temperature is 87°, the average minimum 75°; average annual rainfall is 96 inches.

History
A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with, any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the British Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was liberated on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South-East Asia, and upon the restoration of civilian government, it was detached from the other Settlements of Penang and Malacca and placed under a separate administration.

Government
The first elections were held in April 1948 and only six of the 22 Legislative Council members were elected. In 1951 the number of elected members was increased by three.

The next milestone in Singapore's constitutional development was an Order in Council which came into force on 8th February 1955, and which gave Singapore a large measure of internal self-government. The form of Government was a Council of Ministers collectively responsible to a Legislative Assembly whose membership was increased to 32 members, 25 of whom were elected from single-member constituencies. The other seven members consisted of three official members and four nominated unofficials. The Governor ceased to preside over the Assembly and was replaced by a Speaker whom he appointed.

The Council of Ministers consisted of the Governor as President, three ex officio members and seven Ministers appointed from among the elected and nominated members of the Assembly.

Singapore achieved statehood in 1959 after 140 years of British rule. An agreement signed in London on 11th April 1957 provided for the constitution of a State of Singapore with full internal self-government, and the creation of a Singapore citizenship. There would be as the Queen's representative a Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara, or Head of State, a Cabinet
presided over by the Prime Minister and a fully-elected Legislative Assembly of 51 members presided over by a Speaker and Deputy Speaker of their own selection.

The new constitution under the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958, came into being on 3rd June 1959, by a proclamation of the Governor, Sir William Goode, who thereupon became concurrently Singapore's first Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the United Kingdom Commissioner. These two Offices were, however, after the first six months of the constitution, separated and held by different individuals. The Head of State must now be Malayan-born. The United Kingdom Commissioner remains responsible for external defence and external affairs but responsibility in certain fields of external affairs is delegated to the Government of the State of Singapore.

The Singapore Government is responsible for internal security, subject, however, to the oversight of an Internal Security Council consisting of three representatives each of the United Kingdom and Singapore Governments and one of the Government of the Federation of Malaya.

The Council of Ministers has been replaced by a Cabinet of nine elected Ministers presided over by the Prime Minister. The Ministers are collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly for policy but have full executive authority over their respective ministries, each of which has a Parliamentary Secretary (an elected Assemblyman), and a Permanent Secretary (a Civil Servant) who exercises supervision under the general direction of the Minister. There is a Deputy Prime Minister. The portfolios of the other Ministers are—Labour, Finance, Health and Law, Culture, Home Affairs and Education, National Development.

Towards the end of 1961 the Governments of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore negotiated the heads of an agreement for a merger of the State of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya. These proposals provided that Singapore would be a State within the Federation, but on special conditions and with a larger measure of local autonomy than the other States forming the Federation. Defence, external affairs and security would be the responsibility of the Federation Government; education and labour in particular would be among the matters remaining within the responsibility of the Singapore Government. The proposals were published by the Singapore Government as a White Paper (Cmnd. 33, 1961).

Following talks in London in November 1961 the Prime Ministers of Britain and the Federation of Malaya issued a joint statement agreeing that the creation of a Federation of Malaysia, which would embrace the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei, was a desirable aim. The statement took note with satisfaction of the heads of agreement for the merging of the State of Singapore with the Federation. The text of the statement was published by the British Government as a White Paper (Cmnd. 1563).

Land Policy

Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant State land in the Island is practically exhausted and large areas have had to be acquired for public purposes, such as roads, school sites, housing and particularly for industrial development.

Taxation

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the State or received in the State from outside. Companies are chargeable at 40% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 5% on the first $1,500 of chargeable income to 55% on incomes exceeding $100,000. Non-resident individuals are charged at 40%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. Double taxation arrangements with the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Japan are in force.

Personal allowances are $2,000 for an unmarried person and $3,000 for a married couple, with a sliding scale of allowances for children from $750 for the first child to $200 for the sixth and subsequent children up to a maximum allowance of $8,150 for the family. Earned income relief is 20%, subject to a maximum of $1,000. In cases where children are maintained and educated outside Malaya, the allowances for children may be increased up to double the amounts. Deductions are also allowed in respect of life assurance premia and contributions to approved pension or provident funds.

The Public Debt of the State at the 31st December 1960 amounted to $150 million or approximately $91·79 per head of the population:

(a) S.S. 3% Loan, 1962–72: $30 million
(b) Singapore 3% Rehabilitation Loan, 1962–70: $50 million
(c) Singapore 5% Loan 1959/1967: $15 million
(d) Singapore 5½% Loan 1959/1977–79: $25 million
(e) Singapore:
   - 5% Registered Stock 1960/1968: $30 million
   - 5½% Registered Stock 1960/1978–80: $30 million

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.
Currency

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by:
   (a) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya;
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August 1948.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December 1952 and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December 1960 was $21,790,760-45.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December 1960 was $1,133,337,328-40 and coins (other than silver) $52,278,260-33.

Development Plans

The first Development Plan for the State of Singapore published in April 1961 and approved by the Legislative Assembly, covers the period 1961–1964.

The Plan covers the entire public sector comprising all Government Ministries and statutory bodies (the City Council, the Singapore Harbour Board, the Singapore Telephone Board and the Singapore Housing and Development Board). Approved estimates for development expenditure for Government and statutory bodies are incorporated in the Plan.

Estimated capital expenditure on development projects in the planned period amounts to $871 million. The proportions in which resources are to be allocated between developing economic services and developing social services have been estimated. The Plan emphasises projects conducive to industrial expansion while recognising the need to expand social services to meet the rapid population growth. Approximately 58% of the planned expenditure would be on projects directly contributing to economic development and 41% on projects for social development and improvement of public administration. The major economic development projects are the establishment of the Economic Development Board with a capital of $100 million, the expansion of electricity, gas and water supply which require more than $146 million and the development of industrial estates for which $90 million has been allocated. Other major projects include further development of harbour facilities, the development of Singapore Airport and the improvement of the entire transport and communications system to meet Singapore's growing needs. Total planned expenditure for all transport and communications projects would amount to about $117 million.

Out of the total of $350 million planned for development of social services $284 million is allocated to health, education and housing.

The extensive housing programme requiring $154 million has been formulated in recognition of the fact that past programmes have been on too small a scale to be an effective solution to Singapore's housing problems.

In recent years, estimates of capital formation indicated that the rate of capital formation has been in the region of 10% of the gross national income. It is the aim of the Plan to increase the rate to some 20% of the gross national income, this being estimated to be necessary if the needs of the growing population are to be adequately met.

The Economic Development Board, referred to above, was constituted in August 1961 as a statutory organisation, replacing the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board. Members of the Board include representatives of manufacturing, banking, commerce, labour and academic and professional groups in the State. The United Nations is making available to the Board, under its various technical assistance programmes, the services of senior personnel, including the Director of the Board and experts in industrial economics, technical consultant services and engineers in specialised fields.

Plans provide for the new Board, whose present capital fund of M$40 million will eventually be augmented to M$100 million by grants from Government revenue, to be fully operational by the end of 1961. It will function broadly as a financing institution and as an industrial corporation. As a financing institution, the Board will grant loans and advances to industrial concerns or subscribe to their debentures and shares. It will also underwrite the issue of stocks and guarantee on agreed terms and conditions loans raised by industrial concerns in the public market. In the industrial field, the Board will make economic feasibility studies on industries, provide techno-economic advice and services to industries and plan and lay out industrial estates. The Board expects that industrial development will mostly be initiated, developed and financed by private enterprise. But where the nature of the industries so requires, the Board may establish, invest and manage its own industrial concerns or enter into a partnership or other arrangement for joint working with private industrial firms.

Education

The education system of the State of Singapore provides education for some 370,726 pupils in 751 regular schools. The University of Malaya in Singapore has 1,259 men and 418 women students, of whom 621 are from outside Singapore. There are 11,728 teachers employed, 45·2% of them being trained. Of the school pupils, approximately 18·4% are in secondary classes.

The net cost of education in 1960 was $60·8 million. The comparative figures for 1948 of $4·725 million indicate the vast increase in cost due to the implementation of the State's Development programme in education.
The Nanyang University, which was registered as a limited liability company in 1954, was incorporated by the Nanyang University Ordinance, published on 16th March 1959. In the current academic year (1961/62) there are 1,874 students attending its three colleges of Arts, Science and Commerce. A Nanyang University Commission was set up by agreement with the Ministry of Education and convened in February 1959. The Commission's Report, published on 10th February 1960, has been referred to a Review Committee on steps to be taken for re-organization.

The Singapore Polytechnic has in the current academic year 2,748 students attending classes in four Departments: Accountancy; Nautical; Engineering; Building and Architecture. 1,098 are full-time students, 399 are students released by their employers to attend one full day and two evenings per week and the remainder are evening students.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The National Library contains about 170,000 volumes, including a large and important collection of books on Malaya. There are part-time branches. Books for children are provided at each library, and there is a separate children's library at the Central Library. The library functions as a free public library and is financed by the Government. It serves as the depository for the State's archives and for the books and other publications which are printed in Singapore and received under the terms of the Printers and Publishers Ordinance.

Books in Chinese, Malay and Tamil, which languages are currently spoken in Singapore are now available, as well as books in English and music scores. A mobile library service to schools in the rural areas is in operation and will later be extended to serve the adult population in the rural areas.

A new library building which was begun in 1957 was completed and occupied by the end of 1960. Its facilities include large adult and children's lending libraries, an air-conditioned reference library, stacks and study carrels, a Braille library, and conference, exhibition and lecture halls.

The National Museum (formerly known as the Raffles Museum) contains collections covering the zoology, ethnography and archaeology of the Malaysian region, and of the history of Singapore and Malaya. It publishes the Bulletin of the National Museum (devoted to papers on zoology), the Memoirs of the National Museum (devoted to papers on local history and anthropology) and a series of popular pamphlets on museum subjects.

The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, closely associated with the National Museum, publishes a quarterly journal devoted mainly to papers on history, archaeology and ethnography.

Health

The Ministry of Health controls nine hospitals containing 7,100 beds. The hospitals specialise in acute medical and surgical cases (1,750 beds), infectious diseases (250 beds), maternal and gynaecological cases (445 beds), tuberculosis (1,150 beds), mental disease cases (2,220 beds), leprosy cases (1,020 beds) and venereal disease cases (65 beds). There are 27 static dispensaries, nine travelling dispensaries and two floating dispensaries. In addition, there are 63 main and subsidiary Maternal and Child Health centres. There is an island-wide School Health Service based at the new Institute of Health with four static clinics.

Based on the findings of a full tuberculosis survey carried out in 1958 under the Colombo Plan and a continuing B.C.G. campaign started under U.N.I.C.E.F. auspices in 1951, an extensive Tuberculosis Control programme has been undertaken. The Mass X-ray case-finding programme continues. It is expected that the whole population will be X-rayed within five years. B.C.G. vaccination is now available on an island-wide basis. In 1960 and 1961 70% of all new-born infants were immunised with B.C.G. vaccination and a complete coverage of all primary schools was achieved. Legislation for compulsory B.C.G. vaccination amongst the two groups will be introduced to make the coverage complete.

There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualification of M.B., B.S. registrable in the United Kingdom can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) also registrable in the United Kingdom. A course for the degree of B.Ph. (Bachelor of Pharmacy) has been instituted. A nine-month course for the Diploma of the Royal Society of Health for Public Health Inspectors and a one-year course for the Health Visitor's Certificate of this Society is conducted at the Institute of Health. The University awards a Diploma in Public Health which is recognised by the General Medical Council.

The School of Nursing provides general nurse-training; associated schools provide specialized training for tuberculosis nurses, psychiatric nurses, paediatric nurses, district nurses and public health nurses. The Assistant Nurse Training School and the Midwifery School provide training for Assistant Nurses and Midwives.

The training of public health inspectors is carried out at the Institute of Health and is one of the oldest courses of training in Singapore—having been started in 1921.

Statutory Boards control the qualification and registration of medical practitioners, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and midwives.

Health figures for the State continue to be satisfactory. The crude death rate is 6·24 per 1,000 compared with 19·51 in 1939 and 8·10 in 1955. The infant mortality rate is 34·9 per 1,000 live births compared with 130·4 in 1939 and 49·5 in 1955.

The birth rate of 37·8 per 1,000, representing approximately 62,000 births, is one of the highest in the world. Over half the population in Singapore is under the age of 19 years.

The Blood Transfusion Service, run on a voluntary system, serves all Hospitals; approximately 1,000 transfusions are given each month.

The Government dental service provides free dental care to school-children, expectant and nursing mothers, the chronic sick and the poorer sections of the public at nominal charges. During 1961, five new dental clinics were opened, bringing the total number to 29. Attendances at all clinics total 257,398. A Dental Nurse Training School will be established at the end of 1961.

1961 was the fourth year of fluoridation of the municipal water supply.
Communications

Air—Singapore Airport, seven and a half miles from the city centre, is an international airport, and one of the finest in South-East Asia. It has a runway of 8,000 feet (L.C.N. 60) with a wide taxi-way and efficient lighting. Extension of the runway to 9,000 feet is well under way. The Joint Air Traffic Control Centre based at Singapore Airport controls all flights within the confines of its 750,000 square miles Flight Information Region.

In 1960 a total of 14,153 aircraft and 333,175 passengers used the airport.

Major external international passenger, air mail and cargo air carriers operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways.
- British Overseas Airways Corporation.
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines.
- Pan American World Airways.
- Cathay Pacific Airways.
- Thai Airways International.
- Garuda Indonesian Airways.
- Air Ceylon.
- Air India International.
- Japan Air Lines.

Malayan Airways Limited operate daily domestic flights to all important points in the Federation of Malaya and Borneo, and regular scheduled services to Indonesia, Thailand, Borneo, Sarawak and Hong Kong.

Road—The Public Works Department maintains 514 miles of bituminous roads in the City and Rural areas.

Rail—The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge and the total route mileage is 1,028 miles. The Railway enters the State at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour.

Water—The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers, etc.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu, under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin, on behalf of the Singapore Government. The Chairman and members of the Board are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Wharf                  | Length   | Water depth |
|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| West Wharf             | 4,525 ft.| 33 ft. and over |
| Empire Dock (24½ acres)| 3,522 ft.| 27 ft. and over |
| Main Wharf             | 3,152 ft.| 33 ft. and over |
| East Wharf             | 700 ft.  | 24 ft.      |
| North Wall, Empire Dock| 940 ft.  | 12 ft.      |

During 1960 an all-time record of 19,700 vessels of 69,850,000 net tons entered and cleared the Port. 14·9 million tons of cargo were handled during the year.

The Board maintains a fleet of tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships, including a salvage tug with a range of 3,000 miles; also a Fire Brigade.

The Board has first-class facilities for dry docking and repairing ships of all sizes. There are six dry docks, the largest of these being the King's Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons gross. Repair berths total 3,000 feet in length.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, North and South America, South and East Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the various countries in Asia. Several coasting lines are engaged in conveying transit cargo to and from Thailand, Indonesia, Borneo, Sarawak, Malayan ports and Cambodia.

Broadcasting

Radio Singapore is operated by the Broadcasting Division of the Ministry of Culture. It is the largest publicity medium in the State of Singapore, operating a full time radio service in Chinese (seven dialects), English, Malay and Tamil. Its programmes are broadcast on the medium-wave band and the short-wave band. Four channel transmissions are used: one carries Chinese programmes, one carries English programmes, one is shared by Malay and Tamil programmes and one carries a new service—the "Suara Singapura" (Voice of Singapore) programme. The object of the new service is to promote the national language and, at the same time, to foster the growth of a Malayan culture amongst the various races and communities in Singapore.

The total number of hours of broadcasting average 389½ per week, of which approximately 246 hours are occupied by programmes originating from the Commercial Service, and about 38 hours are devoted to broadcasts for schools in Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil.

Radio Singapore has its studios and offices at Caldecott Hill and its main transmitting station at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the city. There are eight transmitters at this station which are on the air daily. The programmes of Radio Singapore cover every aspect of community service and entertainment.

The Commercial service is potentially the largest service of its kind in Asia, with sponsor time-slots in three channels (four languages).

The activities of Radio Singapore include the National Music Library, the National Radio Archives which comprise all historical programmes dating back to 1945, and the presentation and technical operation of newscasts including news bulletins and news talks in all four languages.

The number of wireless receiving licences in Singapore at the end of July 1961 was 126,182.

A commercial company which operates a wired broadcasting service in Singapore under government licence had 49,325 subscribers in Singapore at 31st July 1961. Some of Radio Singapore's programmes, including news bulletins, are relayed daily.

Plans are in hand for the establishment of a Television Service, and it is hoped to commence the service on a small scale during the latter part
of 1962. When established, the service will provide transmissions in Band III. It will be ultimately partially Commercial.

The TV Standard to be adopted is the C.C.I.R. 625-Lines System.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief industries are: transport and communications (including port and lightercage) 50,000, commerce and finance 129,000, light industries 76,500, agriculture (largely market gardening) 24,000, public administration (central defence services and local authorities) 91,500. There are 128 registered trade unions of employees, having a membership of 144,437.

Main Products

The small area of agricultural land is used mainly to produce food crops for local consumption. Poultry-rearing as a rural industry is thriving and 18,000,000 head are kept. This is more than sufficient for local consumption and allows some to be exported. The number of pigs in Singapore is 750,000.

Manufactures comprise a wide range of light industries. The traditional concentration on the processing of primary products such as rubber, tin, rattan and the provision of ship-building, docking and ship facilities, light engineering works and motor assembly plants has been supplemented in recent years by a growing range of consumer goods such as dry cell batteries, glass products, edible oils, paper products, poultry feed, paints, metal boxes, shoe polish, confectionery, soap, pharmaceutical products and cement. Two refineries, one of which is completed and the other under construction, have been set up under the Pioneer Industries (Relief from Income Tax) Ordinance. Other industries being set up under this Ordinance will include the production of wheat flour, acids, air-conditioners and refrigerators. The manufacture of cigarettes from imported tobacco is also being fairly extensively developed.

The huge long-term building programmes are also materially assisting construction industries such as brick and tile making, cement block manufacturing, saw-milling, metal window framework and manufacture of furniture.

Trade

Singapore handles most of the imports and exports of the Federation of Malaya. In addition much of the external trade of her immediate neighbours passes through her hands. The chief exports are rubber, tin, timber, petroleum products, copra, canned pineapples, coconut oil and spices. A wide range of manufactured consumer and capital goods is also imported for local consumption and for re-export.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. A Pan-Malayan Statutory Board, the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board, is vested with overall authority in the conduct of the affairs of the industry including the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruits, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

At the end of 1960, Singapore had 105 Co-operative Societies, made up of 43 Thrift and Loan Societies, 20 Thrift and Investment Societies,
13 Stores and Shops Societies, 12 Rural Credit and Marketing Societies, 2 Housing Societies, 6 Employees Credit Societies, 1 Union, 2 Banking Societies, and 6 Miscellaneous Societies. Total membership is 37,804, working capital $15,343,818 and Reserve Fund $671,862.
