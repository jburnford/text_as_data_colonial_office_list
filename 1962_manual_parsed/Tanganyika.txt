TANGANYIKA

Following constitutional discussions held at Dar es Salaam in March 1961 under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the territory became internally self-governing on the 1st May 1961 and attained independence and membership of the Commonwealth on 9th December 1961.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is now the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and Her Majesty's Government in Tanganyika.

Basic information about Tanganyika will be found in the 1961 edition of the Colonial Office List.
