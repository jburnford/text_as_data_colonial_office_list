BRITISH HONDURAS

Note:—This entry was largely prepared before Hurricane “Hattie” struck British Honduras on the 31st October 1961. 262 lives were tragically lost and most serious material damage was caused to Belize, Stann Creek and other parts of the country. The actual extent of the damage, and the consequent rehabilitation and development needs, were being examined at the time of going to press. The sections of this entry with asterisked headings, therefore, are particularly subject to review in the light of the examination of the post-hurricane situation.

Area
British Honduras lies on the Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and by Guatemala in the remainder of the west and south. Its land area is about 8,866 square miles, which includes a number of islets, known as “cayes”, lying off the coast.

Population
At the census taken in April 1960 the total population was 90,343 (provisional figure). The main racial groups are: Creoles, American Indians (Maya) and Caribs. There are also a number of persons of East Indian and Spanish descent. The races are, however, now heavily inter-mixed and a great many persons would have considerable difficulty in deciding to which group they belong.

English is the official language and the language taught in the schools. Spanish is also in common use, chiefly by the Indians, whose language it is tending to replace. The term Creole is now commonly used to denote local negroes and persons of negro extraction; it is also used in respect of persons of mixed Spanish and Indian descent.

| Principal Towns          | Population (estimated) |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Belize (capital)         | 32,824                 |
| Corozal                  | 3,172                  |
| Orange Walk              | 2,144                  |
| El Cayo                  | 2,958                  |
| Stann Creek              | 5,271                  |
| Punta Gorda              | 1,755                  |

Geographical Features
The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, form the backbone of the southern half of the Colony. All of the western (Cayo) District is hilly and includes the Mountain Pine Ridge most of which lies between 1,000 and 2,000 feet above sea level but rises in parts to around 3,000 feet. The northern districts are also hilly except towards the coast but contain considerable areas of low tableland. There are seventeen principal rivers, of which the Belize River is the most important. None is navigable by vessels over five feet draught and few for any notable distance. An estimated 92% of the mainland is under forest.

Climate
The climate is sub-tropical and on the whole agreeable to non-tropical peoples. In the capital, Belize, the temperature range during the year is 50° to 96° with an average mean of 78·5°. Most of the year the heat and humidity are tempered by sea breezes. This description applies with small variation along the whole coastal area. Inland the day temperatures, during the dry season, tend to be higher, up to 100°, but drop considerably at night. Rainfall increases from north to south:

| Annual average Inches |
|-----------------------|
| Corozal (north)       | 51                    |
| Belize (central)      | 63                    |
| El Cayo (western central) | 52               |
| Stann Creek (upper south) | 147             |
| Toledo (south)        | 175                   |

There are two dry seasons, the main one from March to May and the other in August and September (called the Maugre Season).

The Colony has been struck from time to time by hurricanes.

In recent years:
- a hurricane struck Belize on the 10th September 1931 causing heavy loss of life and property;
- on the 27th September 1955 Hurricane “Janet” struck the northern part of the country completely destroying the town of Corozal and damaging dozens of villages in the Orange Walk District. Damage was estimated at over $4 million. The United Kingdom Government gave assistance totalling $3,480,000—$800,000 of this being a loan and the rest a free grant;
- on the 15th July 1960 Hurricane “Abby” struck the area of the Sittee River, south of Stann Creek, causing some damage to crops and dwellings;
- on the 24th July 1961 Hurricane “Anna” wrought fairly extensive damage to crops and houses in the villages of Seine Bight and Placencia and Sittee River and almost completely destroyed banana plantations at Waha Leaf in the Stann Creek District;
- on the 31st October 1961 Hurricane “Hattie” caused 262 deaths and most serious damage to Belize, Stann Creek and other parts of the country (see Note at head of this entry).

History
The present Settlement was apparently established in 1638 but British sea rovers were frequenting the Bay from long before that year and there is some evidence that a Settlement was formed in or around 1603. Logwood was the attraction, and the 1638 Settlement was augmented from time to time by sea rovers and—notably after the capture of Jamaica by British forces in 1655—by...
disbanded British soldiers and sailors. In the Treaty of Madrid, 1670, Spain recognized Britain's sovereignty over the Bay Settlement.

Concurrently another and larger British Settlement was building up on the Moskito Indian Coast, far to the south of British Honduras. Modern historians frequently confuse the two Settlements; but although they assisted each other on occasion, they were entirely separate organizations with quite different forms of government. The Moskito Indians stubbornly and successfully resisted Spanish intrusion but welcomed and became loyal allies of the British settlers. The Moskito Coast settlers were known as the Shoremen and the Bay settlers as the Baymen. In 1786 Britain handed over the Moskito Coast to Spain in return for a small and comparatively worthless strip of land contiguous to the Bay Settlement. Some of the Shoremen moved to Jamaica and the rest were compulsorily evacuated to the strip, where they became merged with the Baymen.

The Bay Settlement was a piece of purely British pioneering. The Spaniards found plentiful supplies of logwood, and Indians for slaves, in Northern Yucatan and settled there. Southern Yucatan, on the other hand, was by then practically devoid of Indians and its littoral was a wilderness of mosquito-infested mangrove swamps guarded by lee-shore reefs and tricky channels. The Spaniards therefore left this coast alone until the British began to settle around the mouth of the Belize River. The export of logwood from the Bay Settlement broke the highly profitable Spanish monopoly, brought great prosperity to Britain's wool and cloth-dyeing trades and caused Spain to launch attack after attack on the Settlement in an effort to drive out her competitors.

This armed aggression continued until 1798, when the Spaniards invaded the Settlement in strong naval and military force. The Baymen, although badly under-armed and heavily outnumbered, resisted and, after several days of skirmishing, the forces met in sea battle off St. George's Cay. Supported by H.M. Sloop Merlin, the Baymen fought with such determination that the Spaniards were forced to retreat. This was Spain's last attempt to dislodge the Baymen by force of arms.

Until 1786 the Baymen governed themselves. In that year, after many petitions from the Baymen, England appointed and sent out a Superintendent, but the office was allowed to lapse in 1791. In 1797 Colonel Thomas Barrow was appointed Superintendent and was also given the title of Commander-in-Chief (held by the Governors of the Colony ever since) to enable him to organize the defence against the obviously impending Spanish attack. Thereafter the office of Superintendent continued until 1862, when it was replaced by that of Lieutenant-Governor, under the Governor of Jamaica and the Settlement raised to the status of a Colony. The Baymen resented being subordinated to Jamaica and in 1884 the Colony was detached from Jamaica and given a Governor.

**Constitution**

In 1954 the Legislative Council was replaced by a Legislative Assembly composed of nine elected members three *ex officio* members and a Speaker and three unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The status of the Executive Council was changed to that of chief instrument of policy and it was composed of the Governor, as Chairman, three *ex officio* members and six members of the Legislative Assembly. The latter were elected by the Assembly but included not less than two of the nominated unofficial members of that body. Universal adult suffrage was also introduced in 1954, and the first general election under the new Constitution was held on 28th April 1954. The only fully organized party, the People's United Party, gained eight of the nine elected seats. The principle of Steering Members, appointed by the Governor from among the unofficial members of the Executive Council, as the first step towards full ministerial status, was adopted in 1955.

At the general elections which took place on the 20th March 1957 the People's United Party gained all nine of the elected seats.

In February 1960 a Conference was convened in London by H.M. Government to consider *inter alia* proposals for the development of the Constitution of British Honduras. This conference was attended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State with their Advisers; the Governor of British Honduras and official and unofficial members of the Government; and the leaders of the political parties in the territory.

The Conference decided to adopt a ministerial form of Government based on a revised Legislative Assembly and Executive Council. This revised Constitution was introduced in March 1961 following a general election. The new Legislative Assembly presided over by a Speaker, consists of 18 members elected by the general public, five nominated members and two *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary (formerly known as the Colonial Secretary) and the Attorney General). The normal life of the Assembly is four years. The revised Executive Council under the chairmanship of the Governor, consists of two *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, responsible *inter alia* for defence, security and external affairs, and the Attorney General) and six unofficial members holding various departmental portfolios as Ministers, of whom at least one must be a nominated member of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the political party obtaining a majority at a general election for the Legislative Assembly seats would be appointed First Minister and the remaining five unofficial members of the Executive Council are elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Assembly from among their own number. As regards the five nominated members of the Legislative Assembly, these are filled by the Governor, after consultation with the First Minister in respect of two seats and after consultation with the leader of the minority party in respect of one seat, the remaining two seats being filled by the Governor after consultation with the leaders of both the majority and minority parties. Further details are set out in a White Paper issued by H.M. Government as Cmnd. 984.

At the general election held in March 1961, the People's United Party, led by Mr. George Price, won all the 18 elected seats in the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Price was therupon appointed First Minister and his Ministry has since held office.

The former post of Financial Secretary has now been replaced by that of Permanent Secretary Ministry of Finance, a Ministry which is in the portfolio of the First Minister. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance attends meetings
of the Executive Council but is not a member either of the Council or of the Legislative Assembly.

**Land Policy**

The alienation of Crown land is carefully controlled to prevent, as far as possible, the acquisition of such land for purely speculative, non-productive purposes. No racial discrimination is exercised.

During 1953 and 1954 a land use survey was carried out. A land policy, based on the findings and recommendations of the Survey Team, has been formulated and was published by Government in 1958.

**Taxation**

Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 45% on all income over $25,000. Surtax is levied on the first $2,000 in excess of $8,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 15%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 20%; and on the remainder at 25%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $600, plus allowances for wife, children, dependent relatives, life assurance premiums, earned income and gifts to charity. The rate of tax on companies is 40% of the chargeable income of the company.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1956 | $6,726,936| $6,702,208  |
| 1957 | $8,691,319| $8,002,687  |
| 1958 | $9,187,829| $9,267,786  |
| 1959 | $10,372,233| $10,401,433 |
| 1960 | $8,653,493| $8,328,558  |

In 1960 $2,938,704 of the true revenue was derived from Customs duties and charges and $2,026,975 from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Administration $3,750,311, Public Works $2,519,969, Social Services $1,608,792.

The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1960 amounted to $4,715,799. Sinking funds on hand amounted to $835,983, leaving $3,879,816 as the net outstanding debt.

**Currency**

The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 are issued and there is a silver coinage of 50, 25 and 10 cents, a nickel coin of 25 cents (new issue) and one of 5 cents and a bronze 1 cent coin.

**Development Plans**

British Honduras received Colonial Development and Welfare allocations from the United Kingdom totalling £2,250,000 during the period 1945–56. Additional allocations totalling £1,950,000 were made for the period 1955–60 and a further allocation of £2,000,000 has been made under the 1959 Act for the period up to March 1964.

Under the Development Plan (1955–60) the bulk of the Colonial Development and Welfare funds is being spent on projects which will raise the general economy of the country and so result in a higher standard of living for all. A substantial part of the money is being spent on agriculture, forestry and communications. Considerable sums are also set aside for education, social welfare, medical services and housing.

Under the Development Loan Ordinance, 1952, and the Loans (General Development) Ordinance, 1957, loans totalling $2,257,441, had been raised by the end of 1959, $832,525 of this by the issue of Government debentures locally, and the balance by inter-Colonial Loan.

**Other Development**

The Fort George Hotel, built by the Colonial Development Corporation, was opened for business in 1953. It has 35 bedrooms and is designed for tourist trade. Expansion in accommodation is contemplated to meet increasing patronage.

The Citrus Company of British Honduras continues to expand the cultivation of grapefruit and oranges in the Stann Creek Valley. Exports of oranges and products thereof are increasing.

The Hummingbird Development Company is going forward with plans for the establishment of some 2,000 acres of cacao. Government has established a nursery to supply seedlings and demonstration plots have been laid out.

Following an enquiry into the future economic development of British Honduras in October 1959 by Mr. Jack Downie, a Senior Economic Adviser at H.M. Treasury, it has been agreed that the central feature of economic policy should be planned immigration aimed at the creation, as quickly as financial, sociological and other considerations allow, of an agricultural economy based on large scale enterprises (i.e. plantations) and individual small holdings.

Good cane production and expanded milling facilities enabled the Corozal sugar factory during 1961 to meet for the first time the country's 25,000 ton quota under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.

**Education**

Primary education is principally through subsidized denominational schools controlled by a Board of Education. There were at the end of 1960, two government and 121 grant-aided primary schools with an enrolment of 20,589. In addition there are 35 unaided primary schools with an enrolment of 1,800. There are 13 secondary schools, all unaided and denominational with 1,694 pupils, one government-run Technical College with 96 pupils and two Teacher Training Colleges. There is no provision for education of university standard but scholarships are awarded which carry the recipients to the University College of the West Indies (Jamaica) and to universities in the U.K.. The University College stations an Extramural Tutor in Belize.

Expenditure on education from general revenue during 1960 was $769,025, compared with $71,175 in 1935.

**Libraries, etc.**

The British Honduras Library service has reading rooms, a reference section, a lending section, a children's section, and a stock of over 37,000 books. Boxes of books are circulated to 33 sub-libraries in the districts. The Baron Bliss Institute, Belize, was formally handed over to Government by the Baron Bliss Trust in 1954. The Institute has a modern dramatic stage and auditorium, lecture rooms, an exhibition hall and...
in addition houses the Public Library and the local branch of the Extramural Department of the University College of the West Indies.

The British Council has a resident representative in Belize.

**Health**

The Colony is relatively free from endemic disease. Malaria, which is most prevalent, has shown a substantial decrease in incidence owing to the half-yearly spraying with D.D.T. undertaken by government. The main general hospital is in Belize and there are small hospitals in each of the five districts, all run by government. Beds total 328. Some sixteen Government and Mission rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse.

A tuberculosis hospital a venereal disease unit, an infirmary and a mental hospital are also maintained by Government in Belize.

Expenditure on health services from general revenue during 1960 was $720,604 compared with $80,071 in 1935.

**Communications**

Stanley Field, about ten miles north-west of Belize, is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services are operated to the Colony by the following airlines:

- British West Indian Airways (B.W.I.A.).
- Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. International).
- Servicio Aereo de Honduras, S.A. (S.A.H.S.A.).
- Transportes Aereos Nacionales, S.A. (T.A.N.).

There is a weekly service between Jamaica and Belize and twice-weekly services New Orleans (U.S.A.), Belize and San Salvador via Guatemala City and return; Miami, Belize and San Pedro Sula (Honduras) and return; San Pedro Sula, Puerto Barrios (Guatemala) and Belize and return. British Honduras Airways also operate an internal air service, on schedule to certain district towns and on charter to other parts of the Colony.

There are 492 miles of all-weather main and feeder roads and 174½ miles of cart roads and bush trails maintained by Government. Forty-three miles of new feeder roads have been built to serve the sugar cane industry in the Corozal district. An unknown, but considerable, mileage of dirt roads built by logging contractors and the Forest Department, public use of which is permitted, will take, for example, jeeps and landrovers, in the dry season.

The United Fruit Company maintains a weekly passenger and cargo service between Belize and New Orleans. The T. and J. Harrison and the Royal Netherlands S.S. lines offer a regular fortnightly cargo service between Belize and the United Kingdom and Europe respectively, the Royal Netherlands ships offering limited passenger accommodation. The Caribbean line operates an irregular service between New York and Belize.

In 1960 a total of 35 steam and motor vessels and 27 sailing vessels, 1,145 gross tons in all, registered at the port of Belize. The tonnage of shipping which entered the Colony totalled 375,461 net tons.

**Broadcasting**

Government operates a radio broadcasting service (B.H.B.S.) transmitting from Belize on the following frequencies and powers: 1,280 kc/s (235 metres), 1 kW.; 3.3 Mc/s. (90' metres), 5 kW. and 4.9 Mc/s. (60 metres), 250 watts. Programmes are given in English and Spanish and include both local and foreign news, announcements of local interest, transcribed music and plays. Daily time totals about five hours but will increase as local talent, now being fostered, becomes available. Licensed receiving sets in the Colony totalled 1,923 in 1960.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the working population are engaged in agriculture on their own account.

The numbers engaged in the principal wage earning occupations at the 1946 census were:

- Agriculture ... 5,865
- Manufacture and Repair ... 2,551
- Forestry ... 2,040
- Personal Service ... 1,879
- Trade and Finance ... 1,716
- Public Service ... 1,357

(Later estimates are not considered wholly reliable and are therefore not quoted here, while the 1960 Census figures are not yet available.)

Membership of trade unions totalled 2,490 (declared nominal membership) at the end of 1960. There are four trade unions in the Colony.

**Main Crops and Products**

Indian corn (maize), beans and peas, rice, sugar, cassava and yams are the principal food crops of the Colony. The main export crops are coconuts, citrus fruits and products, sugar, bananas and maize. Pigs and poultry are raised throughout the Colony. Timber is the principal export product, mainly mahogany, pine and cedar. Rosewood, banak, Santa Maria and other woods are also exported. Efforts are being directed to building up the Colony's fisheries and an export trade to the United States, chiefly in lobsters, is growing.

Of industries sawmilling is the most important and a cigarette factory, a soap factory, an aluminium door, window and louvre fabricating factory and several small furniture factories, are operating in Belize. In different parts of the Colony there are canneries, one operating in the Stann Creek Valley on citrus products is of notable size and in the Corozal District there is a large sugar factory.

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

A Marketing Board is operated by Government; its principal concern is with the purchase of agricultural produce such as rice, beans and corn at guaranteed prices and the marketing of these products both locally and abroad. It also makes seasonal crop loans.

At the end of 1960 there were 41 Credit Unions, one Consumer Co-operative, five Producers' Co-operatives, six Marketing Cooperatives, three Farmers' Co-operatives, nine Housing Co-operatives and one Multi-purpose Co-operative. In addition there were 30 junior and two senior Savings Unions and a secondary society, The British Honduras Credit Union League, Ltd.
