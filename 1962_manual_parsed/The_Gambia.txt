THE GAMBIA

Area
The total area is 4,003 square miles (Colony 29 square miles, Protectorate 3,974 square miles). St. Mary’s Island, with an area of about 2,500 acres of dry land, is included in the Colony area.

Population
The latest estimate of the total population is 283,761 composed as follows:

- Colony—Bathurst—23,655; Kombo St. Mary—9,286; Protectorate—250,820. In 1960 there were 4,941 seasonal immigrants. The population of Bathurst is African except for a few hundred Europeans, Syrians and Lebanese. The main tribal groups in the Protectorate are:

| Approximate Nos. |
|------------------|
| Mandingo         | 102,000 |
| Fula (all tribal subdivisions) | 47,000 |
| Wolof            | 28,000 |
| Serahuli         | 23,000 |
| Jola             | 20,000 |
| Jomboonko        | 6,000 |
| Lorobo           | 6,000 |
| Others (of less than 5,000) | 19,000 |

The Principal Towns are—

**Colony**
- Bathurst—capital; population 23,655.

**Protectorate**
- Western Division—Brikama.
- Lower River Division—Mansa Konko.
- MacCarthy Island Division—Georgetown.
- Upper River Division—Basse.

Population in the Protectorate is evenly distributed and there are no towns of over 3,000 inhabitants.

Geographical Features
The River Gambia, some 700 miles in length, flows into the Atlantic by a wide estuary which narrows to two and a half miles between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary’s Island. There are 27 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 17 feet can at present proceed without trouble to Kuntaur 150 miles up-river. There is no bar to the River Gambia. The Colony consists mainly of the Island of St. Mary, at the mouth of the River Gambia, the adjoining division of Kombo St. Mary and MacCarthy Island in the middle river. The Protectorate consists of strips of territory on either bank of the river, for most of their length no more than seven miles wide.

Climate
The Gambia has a long dry season, normally from November to May, which is pleasant with its low temperature and humidity, due to the effect of the harmattan. Rainfall is confined to the period from June to October and averages about 40 inches on the coast, decreasing inland. The dry season climate near the coast is better than in most places in West Africa, with the exception, perhaps, of the Cameroons highlands. During the wet season, however, humidity increases and is higher on the coast. Up-river it is much hotter but less humid, especially during the period February to May, after which the heat gradually decreases, with a rapid increase of humidity.

History

The Gambia was discovered by the Portuguese in 1455 but they made no lasting settlement. Between 1588 and 1752 Royal Charters were granted to various English merchants to trade with it. French merchants also plied during that period but the right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. From 1807 to 1816 the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off, in part due to the abolition of the slave trade. In 1816 a new settlement was founded on the Island of Banjul by English merchants from Senegal. Banjul was renamed St. Mary's and its town named after Lord Bathurst the then Secretary of State.

The settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone and was annexed to that Colony by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a Military Commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court", administered the Government. From 1822 to 1829 the Commandant governed alone.

In December 1829, the Secretary of State appointed the first Lieutenant Governor "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia". The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

In 1843 the Gambia was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs.

By the charter of 1866 it became a portion of the West African Settlements and continued to be so under the charter of 1874 until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions of 1840, 1850 and 1853. In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection. Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894 and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. This ordinance has since been superseded by the Protectorate Ordinance, 1935. There is a Commissioner in charge of each Division and each District is under a District Head Chief.

Constitution

In September 1959 the Secretary of State accepted certain proposals for constitutional changes and a new Constitution for the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia came into operation in April 1960.

Under the Gambia (Constitution) Order in Council, 1960, the provisions of which apply both to the Colony and to the Protectorate, the Executive Council consists of four ex officio Members, and not more than six Appointed Members. Of the six Appointed Members, all of whom must be Elected or Nominated Unofficial members of the House of Representatives, one has been appointed a Chief Minister with general responsibility for co-ordinating the whole field of ministerial activity and is also responsible in the House of Representatives for leading the business of the Government, five have been appointed Ministers with Portfolio and assigned special responsibilities for:

(a) Conducting in the Executive Council and the House of Representatives business relating to the matters within their respective portfolios;

(b) ensuring in association with the appropriate public officer, that effect is given to decisions taken by the Governor in Executive Council relating to these matters, and

(c) initiating policy in matters included in their respective portfolios.

The Governor attends and presides at meetings of the Executive Council. With certain specified exceptions the Governor is still required to consult the Executive Council in the exercise of his powers, but may act in opposition to their advice if he deems it right so to do.

The House of Representatives consists of a Speaker, four ex officio Members, and up to three Nominated Members and 27 Elected Members of whom five represent Bathurst, two represent Kombo St. Mary Division, 20 represent the Protectorate of whom 12 are elected on a basis of universal suffrage and eight by the Chiefs. Meetings of the House of Representatives are presided over by the Speaker but the Governor retains the right to attend any meeting and preside thereat. The usual legislative powers of the House are subject to the Governor's reserve powers to legislate by declaration if he considers it expedient so to do in the interest of public order, public faith or good government.

In July 1961, the Secretary of State agreed to certain proposals for further Constitutional changes and it is expected that a new Constitution for the Colony and Protectorate will come into operation by the middle of the year when the Executive Council will be comprised of a Premier, Ministers, and the Attorney-General, who will attend in an advisory capacity. The Executive Council will be presided over by the Governor.

The House of Representatives will consist of a Speaker, to be elected by the House; a Deputy Speaker, to be elected by the House from among its members; Elected Members (seven from the Colony and 25 from the Protectorate); the Attorney-General who will not have a vote; not more than two members are to be nominated by the Governor after consultation with the Premier (also without voting rights); and four chiefs are to be elected by the Chiefs in assembly.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized in the Colony and there is no restriction on the acquisition of land by non-natives. Freehold interests in Crown lands are not disposed of except in special circumstances and with the sanction of the Secretary of State. A grant of Crown lands for a term of years may be made by the Governor. The normal term is 21 years with an option of renewal for a like term.

Land in the Protectorate is held on native customary tenure from the District Authority for the district in which it is vested. In general, land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives.
without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 21 years. Leases of small plots suitable for commercial or industrial purposes may be obtained from the District Authority for the district, with the approval of the Governor. The power to approve is delegated to the Commissioner for Local Government.

**Taxation**

There are sliding scales of personal income tax which amounts to the following rates on chargeable incomes or total incomes, whichever yields the greater tax (incomes of single persons up to £200 a year and married persons up to £350 a year are free of tax and there are additional allowances for dependants):

| Chargeable income | Average rate of tax in the £ |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| £400              | s. d.                         |
| 400               | 6                             |
| 400               | 1 0                           |
| 400               | 2 6                           |
| 1,100             | 5 0                           |
| 8,000             | 10 0                          |
| remainder         | 15 0                          |

**Total Income**

(not applicable to non-residents)

| From £151 to £200, inclusive a year | £ s. d. |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| From £201 to £250, inclusive a year | 1 10 0  |
| From £251 to £300, inclusive a year | 2 0 0   |
| From £301 to £350, inclusive a year | 3 0 0   |

Exceeding £350 at 3d. on every pound of total income.

The Company rate is 9s. in the £. There is no estate duty.

There is a direct tax on inhabitants of the Protectorate known as the District Rate which accrues to the District Treasuries. The rate at present in most areas is 3s. per "yard" of not more than four houses, though in some of the larger and more developed towns higher rates are being introduced. There are additional rates for lodgers in the "yard" and "strange farmers".

The other main form of taxation is the Customs tariff.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1957 | £2,128,107 | £1,817,931 |

(estimated) (estimated)

Development receipts for the year amounted to £289,200 and expenditure £524,895. The main Heads of Expenditure were:

- Government Development Schemes £236,612
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes £210,514
- Colony's Farmers' Fund Schemes £77,742

The estimated total recurrent revenue for 1961 was £1,509,712 including the following main heads of revenue, viz:

- Customs £745,150
- Direct Taxation £270,500
- Fees, etc. £174,653

The estimated total expenditure on departmental services was: £2,116,040.

In the same year the main Receipts in the Development estimates were: £167,000 from the Colony's General revenue balance and Recurrent revenue; Colonial Development and Welfare grants £596,446; Contributions from the Colony's Farmers' Fund £116,134.

The main Heads of Expenditure were:

- Government Development Schemes £173,731
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes £606,526
- Farmers' Fund Schemes £128,654

The Public Debt of the Gambia at the end of December 1960 amounted to £238,760, and the Sinking Fund to £90,946.

In view of the worsening financial position over the past two to three years and the inevitability of a persistent deficit on current account the United Kingdom Government have agreed to give annual grants-in-aid of administration with effect from 1961. The estimated grant required is £151,265.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s., 6d.; cupro-nickel coin of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d., and ½d. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

A total of £1,300,000 was originally made available under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Of this sum £800,000 was for services (medical, agricultural, veterinary and educational) including capital expenditure on buildings and plant; £500,000 was for the development of Bathurst and the Kombo.

The major capital works which will remain as monuments of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 are:

(i) A new hospital in Bathurst.
(ii) A new town drainage system.
(iii) 400 acres of adjacent reclaimed land which was formerly swamp.
(iv) A new urban water supply.
(v) New schools.
(vi) New health centres and rural dispensaries.
(vii) New veterinary headquarters.
(viii) New paved streets in Bathurst.
(ix) New quarters for meteorological and airport staff.
(x) Armitage School, Georgetown.
(xi) Oyster Creek Bridge, length 720 ft.
(xii) Road Bridge at Pakali Ba, 100 ft. span.
(xiii) New High School Science Block, Bathurst.
Other schemes include research into pest infestation, veterinary and agricultural improvement, the Gambia Rice Farm, experimental work on bilharzia, sociological research and reconstruction of some roads in the Protectorate to an all-weather standard. Work commenced in 1960 on the construction of a bitumen surfaced road between Brikama and Mansakonko, where it will join the Trans-Gambia road which provides a lateral link with flanking Senegalese territory. The road when completed will be the largest project financed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds in the Gambia.

Gambia’s initial territorial allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955 was £200,000. Its unspent balance from the previous development was approximately £600,000. It therefore had a total territorial allocation for 1955–60 of approximately £800,000, to which has been added the sum of £50,000 made as a supplementary allocation in 1957.

A further £1 million has been made available up to March 1963 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959.

A programme of further development schemes for the Gambia within the funds now made available has been approved and provides for the continuation of uncompleted schemes and for new schemes, including road bridges at Brumen and Sami, new all-weather ferry terminals at Barra and Bathurst, new primary schools in Bathurst and Phase II of the New High School, Bathurst. This programme is, however, being reviewed in the light of the deterioration in the overall financial situation.

Other Development

The “Farmers’ Fund” established from the profits of the Oilseeds Marketing Board for the purpose of financing development projects has provided funds for schemes to open up new rice lands, train farmers in the use of ox-drawn ploughs and other implements and for many other enterprises of an agricultural nature. Schemes to improve village water supplies and rebuild river wharves are being implemented. Loans and grants from the “Farmers’ Fund” have been made to District Authorities to enable them to build new schools and expand existing ones.

A programme of construction and improvement to rural water supplies continues and there are over 350 wells of which 100 are equipped with pumps. The construction of a further 200 wells is planned and where required washing slabs and cattle watering troughs are also provided. The reconstruction of 26 river wharves continues at a good pace, the arrival of new piling equipment having considerably accelerated progress. The planning of six permanent wharves is in hand. Both schemes are financed by the Farmers’ Fund, the latter on equal share basis with government.

Education

A White Paper on Government policy was published in January 1961 (Sessional Paper No. 1/1961); this provides for a six-year basic primary course after which pupils are selected by means of a Common Entrance examination either for a Secondary Grammar course leading to School Certificate or a Secondary Modern course of 4 years’ duration.

There were over 10,000 pupils attending school in the Gambia in 1961 compared with 2,750 in 1945.

In the urban area of Bathurst, primary education is mainly a Government responsibility; there was an enrolment in 1961 of 3,051 pupils in the basic primary classes run by Government, divided amongst 10 schools; eight of these were formerly Mission schools and were taken over by Government under the Local Agreement of 1945; they are now administered by Management Committees on which the former religious authority Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic or Muslim is represented. Fees of 10s. per annum are charged in these schools. The former Roman Catholic schools have retained their senior primary classes (189 pupils), the remainder have been grouped at Crab Island School (see below). There are in addition two private schools (enrolment 373 pupils), run by the Methodist and Roman Catholic Missions respectively as preparatory and Kindergarten schools, at which higher fees are charged.

In the rural area of the Colony there are Government primary schools at Bakau and Serekunda and a grant-aided Roman Catholic Mission school at Kanifing. All these schools provide the basic primary course with additional senior primary classes and the total enrolment is 1,123 pupils.

There are 49 village primary schools in the Protectorate with 3,764 pupils; 32 of these are owned by the District Authorities and staffed mainly by Government teachers. The remainder are Mission Schools (16 Roman Catholic, one Anglican); the salaries of qualified teachers in these schools are reimbursed by Government.

Secondary Grammar education is concentrated mainly in Bathurst where there are three schools. The Gambia High School, opened in 1959, is a mixed school which absorbed the former Methodist Boys’ and Girls’ High Schools and the Bathurst School of Science. It is an independent non-denominational school administered by a Board of Governors; new school buildings are in course of construction and a Science block has been completed. Sixth Form classes were started in 1960 and the first pupils will be taking Advanced level in the General Certificate of Education in 1962. The Roman Catholic Boys’ and Girls’ Schools continue as separate schools. Total enrolment in all Secondary Grammar schools was 402 boys and 222 girls in 1961: about 50 pupils are presented for the West African School Certificate each year. The new Government post-primary school at Crab Island has 535 pupils including 147 girls; there is a three-year course which is to be extended to four years in 1962. Fees at Secondary Grammar schools are £6 to £9 per annum and at Secondary Modern schools £3 per annum.

Armitage School at Georgetown in MacCarthy Island Division is a post-primary boarding school for Protectorate pupils; it had 136 boys and 11 girls in 1961. Work has now been completed on new buildings for the school, making possible an increased intake of 60 pupils a year, and an enrolment of 240 pupils.

Yundum College, 15 miles from Bathurst, trains both men and women teachers for Government and Mission schools; there is a three-year course, reduced to two years for students who have completed their secondary schooling. There were 97 students including 21 women in 1961 and plans are in hand to enlarge the College to 130 students.
The Technical Trade School in Bathurst provides artisan training for 30 carpenters, who spend three years at the school and a further two years in on-service training either with the Public Works Department or with commercial firms. Additional workshops for metalwork have been provided and equipped from American funds and a Technical Instructor has been seconded by the Canadian Government under the Technical Assistance Scheme.

There are over 50 Gambians pursuing University courses overseas; 11 of these are at Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone, 1 is in Ghana and the remainder in the United Kingdom or Ireland. All hold either full Government Scholarships or Bursaries; in addition about 100 private students are following a variety of courses mostly part-time in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure (recurrent) on education in 1961 was £155,861, representing 9·1% of total recurrent expenditure. (Figures for 1960 were £51,388 and 4·9%.)

Health

The most important diseases are malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, ankylostomiasis, ascariasis, filariasis, trachoma, yaws, anaemias and malnutrition. The Health Service includes special mosquito control units at Bathurst, Cape St. Mary, and Yundum International Airport. Health Inspectors are posted throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

Medical facilities are based upon two hospitals, at Bathurst and at Bansang, in MacCarthy Island Division. The Victoria Hospital, at Bathurst, is a well equipped general hospital, opened in 1953 and having 175 beds. Also in the Bathurst area are a small sanatorium and mental hospital, and a Home for the Infirm, also used for long stay cases. Bansang Hospital is a rural hospital of 75 beds, and nearby there is a small leprosy settlement which is being expanded. In 1960, the total numbers of cases treated in the two hospitals were 6,643 in-patients and 65,846 out-patients; the total number of out-patient attendances was 101,926.

There are seven Health Centres and 42 dispensaries and sub-dispensaries scattered throughout the country. Total attendances at these units in 1960 were 346,770.

Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics are held in Bathurst and at 20 places outside Bathurst. The total attendances at antenatal clinics in 1960 were 26,865 and at Child Welfare Clinics they were 86,922.

A school feeding and nutrition project is being assisted by W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. It consists of the issue of supplementary rations of skim milk and vitamin capsules to school children, younger children and pregnant women and nursing mothers. Issues were made in 1960 through the schools and through 14 Maternity and Child Welfare clinics. A total of 1,573,405 daily rations was issued, representing 88 tons of dried skim milk.

A Leprosy Control Project is being implemented by Government with the assistance of W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. Treatment is on an out-patient basis and is available at 46 clinics throughout the country. At the end of 1960 the number of cases under treatment was 6,257.

The estimated recurrent Government expenditure on the Medical and Health Services in 1960 was £183,971 and the estimated capital expenditure was £29,726. This is 7·9% of total estimated Government expenditure.

Communications

The international aerodrome is at Yundum, 17 miles from Bathurst. The Director of Public Works is also the controller of Civil Aviation and the airport control services are run on behalf of Government by International Aeradio Limited. The Public Works Department maintains runways, buildings and water supplies; mains and standby generator being the responsibility of the Electricity Department. Meteorological services are provided by a branch of the West African Meteorological Service. Scheduled return flights between Accra and Dakar calling at Ibadan, Robertsfield, Freetown and Bathurst are run by W.A.A.C. (Nigeria) once a week and Ghana Airways once a week. The latter service also calls at Conakry, night stopping at Bathurst. British United Airways operates one return flight each week from Gatwick Airport to Accra calling at Las Palmas (night stop) Bathurst and Freetown.

There are approximately 760 miles of roads in the Gambia excluding district tracks and of this total only 106 miles are to an all-weather standard. A current five-year programme allows for the reconstruction of 234 miles to all-weather standard and the provision of bridges and culverts to British Standard Heavy Loading. Apart from bitumenizing Bathurst streets, now well in hand, similar treatment is being accorded to main streets in the larger Protectorate trading centres.

The chief port, Bathurst, handled 99,320 tons of cargo in 1960. Services for passengers and cargo are provided by the Elder Dempster Lines and Palm Line and occasionally by John Holt and Company. River ports are used for the loading of some 34,000 tons of decorticated groundnuts into ocean-going shipping annually. The H.M.C.S. Lady Wright and the H.M.C.S. Fulladu maintain a weekly service between the main river ports from Bathurst to Basse, a distance of about 242 miles up the Gambia River. The two vessels carried in 1960 a total of 1,090 cabin passengers, 20,687 deck passengers and approximately 3,010 tons of cargo. In addition the Landing Craft Jarga carried approximately 683 tons of cargo to river ports exclusively for Government Departments.

There are no railways.

Broadcasting

There is no wireless or wired broadcasting station in the Gambia. Domestic radio receivers operate without fee.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated numbers in other occupations are:

| Occupation          | Number |
|---------------------|--------|
| Government Service  | 3,836  |
| Building            | 322    |
| Distributive Trades  | 4,753  |
| Shipping            | 356    |
| Others              | 318    |

There are three Trade Unions—the Gambia Labour Union, the Gambia Workers Union and the River Trade and Dealers Union (formerly the River Trade and Commercial Workers Union).
Main Crops and Products

The main crops are groundnuts, for export and oil production, rice, sorghum and millet; some maize and a little cotton for village weaving are also grown.

Preliminary investigations into the possibility of drilling for oil have been made with results which are not yet conclusive.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 142,985; sheep 50,500; goats 75,500; pigs 2,600; horses 200; donkeys 4,300; poultry 227,100.

A fair amount of fish is caught in coastal waters and some in the lower river; very little, however, is done further up-river, though fish are fairly plentiful.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

The Gambia Oilseeds Marketing Board handles the export of all groundnuts and other oilseeds. Its aims are to ensure orderly marketing, to improve the quality of exports and from its profits to finance schemes of research and development. A Cattle Marketing Board was set up in 1955. There has been a steady increase in the development of Farmers’ Marketing Co-operatives since the registration of the first societies in 1956 and there are now 62 registered societies which handled 6·6% of the 1961 groundnut crop.
