**SARAWAK**

**Area**
The area of the Colony is approximately 48,250 square miles.

**Population**
The results of the census taken on 15th June 1960 give a total population of 744,529 comprising the following groups:

| Group            | Population |
|------------------|------------|
| Sea Dayak        | 237,741    |
| Chinese          | 229,154    |
| Malay            | 129,300    |
| Land Dayak       | 57,619     |
| Melanaua         | 44,661     |
| Other indigenous | 37,931     |
| Others           | 6,492      |
| European         | 1,631      |
| **Total**        | **744,529** |

**Principal Towns**
- Kuching (capital) .. 50,579
- Sibu .. 29,630
- Miri .. 13,350
- Simanggang .. 5,648
- Bintulu .. 5,307
- Sarikei .. 4,204

**Geographical Features**
The Colony consists of a coastal strip some 450 miles long and varying from 40 to 120 miles wide on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo. A broken range of mountains runs south-west through the middle of the island and Sarawak lies between this range and the sea. The southern border with West, or Indonesian, Borneo, is formed by another range of mountains running westerly from about the centre of the main range. The country is divided into three main zones. Firstly, an alluvial and swampy coastal plain in which isolated mountains and mountain groups rise to 2,000 feet or more, then rolling country of yellow sandy clay intersected by ranges of mountains and finally a mountainous area in the interior. The highest peak is Murud, 7,950 feet. The Rejang (350 miles long) and Sarawak Rivers are navigable for ocean-going ships for 170 and 22 miles respectively. Others are navigable by coastal steamers or launches. Most of the rivers have shallow bars which limit the size of the vessels entering. On the Trusun, Limbang, Baram and Rejang Rivers, gorges and dangerous rapids occur well below the sources. Lowland tropical rain forest covers approximately 34,000 square miles, or 72% of the land area of the Colony. Much of this forest is inaccessible until the internal communications of the country can be improved.

**Climate**
The climate is humid with heavy rainfall and temperatures ranging from 72°F. to 88°F. and on exceptionally hot days to 96°F. October to March is the season of the north-east monsoon with the heaviest rains, relatively strong winds and high seas. The remainder of the year has less rainfall with occasional dry periods lasting up to three weeks. The average annual rainfall varies between 120 to 160 inches.

**History**
The history of Sarawak as an integral State begins with the first landing of James Brooke in 1839. At that time Sarawak was the southern province of the Brunei Sultanate. The oppression of the Sultan's viceroy, Makota, had goaded Malays and Land Dayaks into revolt. James Brooke interceded in the dispute, brought about a settlement and was rewarded for his services by being installed in 1841 as Rajah of the territory from Cape Datu to the Samarahan River. Thereafter Rajah Brooke devoted himself to the suppression of piracy and head-hunting, often with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy, which performed almost incredible feats of navigation and endurance. Sarawak was recognized as an independent State by the United States of America in 1850 and by Great Britain in 1864. In 1861 the territory of Sarawak was enlarged by the Sultan's cession of all rivers and lands from the Sadong River to Kidurong Point.

At his death in 1868, Sir James Brooke bequeathed to his nephew and successor, Charles Brooke, a country paternally governed, with a solid foundation of mutual trust and affection between ruler and ruled. In 1882 the frontier was advanced beyond the Baram River. In 1885 the valley of the Trusun River was ceded and in 1890 the Limbang River was annexed at the request of the inhabitants. In 1905 the Lawas River area was purchased from the British North...
Borneo Company, with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

The third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, succeeded his father in 1917, and progress continued in all spheres. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound economic position with large reserves. To celebrate the centenary, the Rajah enacted a new constitution, and set his people on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

During the Japanese occupation, social services and communications were neglected; education ceased; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State. After the surrender of Japan, the Australian forces entered Kuching on the 11th September 1945 and Sarawak was for seven months administered by a British Military Administration, as a result of whose efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed and the medical and educational services reorganized. The Rajah resumed the administration of the State on the 15th April 1946. It was, however, evident to him that greater resources and more technical and scientific experience were needed to restore to Sarawak her former prosperity. He therefore decided to hand the country over to the British Crown and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May 1946 and passed by a small majority. By an Order in Council the State became a British Colony on the 1st July 1946.

Constitution

A new Constitution was granted to Sarawak by the Sarawak (Constitution) Orders in Council, 1956, which were brought into force in 1957. Under this Constitution the Council Negri (i.e. the legislature) consists of twenty-four Elected Members, not more than fourteen ex officio Members, four Nominated Members and three Standing Members (who were appointed for life by His Highness the Rajah before Cession, one of whom has since died and another retired from the Civil Service in December last). The Supreme Council (i.e. the Executive Council) consists of five Elected Members (elected by the Council Negri from amongst its Elected, Nominated and Standing Members by secret ballot), three ex officio Members and two Nominated Members. The Council Negri Elections Ordinance, Cap. 7, provides for Electoral Colleges and Sub-Electoral Colleges. The Electoral Colleges are the five Divisional Advisory Councils, the Kuching Municipal Council, the Sibu Urban District Council and the Miri District Council.

The new Constitution replaces the Constitution granted by His Highness the Rajah in 1941 as amended by the Sarawak Letters Patent, 1946.

Federation of Malaysia

Following talks in London in November 1961 the Prime Ministers of Britain and the Federation of Malaya issued a joint statement agreeing that the creation of a Federation of Malaysia, which would embrace the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei, was a desirable aim. The text of the statement has been published by the British Government as a White Paper (Cmnd. 1563).

It was agreed that before coming to a final decision it would be necessary to ascertain the views of the people of North Borneo and Sarawak and it was decided to set up a Commission to carry out this task and make recommendations. The Commission was expected to visit the territories in February and March 1962.

Land Policy

All land in Sarawak is classified under one of the following headings: mixed zone land, native area land, native customary land, interior area land or reserved land. Only mixed zone land may be alienated under title to a person who is not a native of Sarawak. Native area land may be held under title only by a native of Sarawak and may not be occupied by a non-native.

Native customary land is land over which a native of Sarawak has established native customary rights of user by planting a crop or otherwise making use of vacant and unclaimed land. Native customary land is held under right of user only and may be part of an area classified as mixed zone land, native area land or interior area land. Before native customary land can be alienated native customary rights must be surrendered or extinguished, or provision made for compensating the holders of the right. Native customary rights may be transferred by inheritance but not otherwise. Native customary land is farmed generally under a bush fallow system with 6 to 15 years between crops, although small scattered areas are under mixed fruit or rubber.

Interior area land is generally situated well away from the main centres and lines of communication and may not be held under title. Native customary rights may be established over interior area land only under permit from the District Officer.

Most of the alienated land is held by smallholders, although there are a few holdings of 500 acres or more. Government policy is to encourage smallholders to own their land. Land utilization surveys are being carried out to assess land available for agricultural development and, where possible, planned settlement schemes are being introduced.

The Land Code, combining and revising all previous legislation except that dealing with subdivision of urban land, was enacted in 1957 and came into effect on 1st January 1958.

Taxation

The only direct taxes levied on the native population by Government are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year and the Malay "head tax" of $1 per year which is levied on all males of working age. These taxes are transferred to local authorities, where existent, who may in certain circumstances levy a cess of a similar amount on other indigenous races. Where a Local Authority imposes a general purpose rate on all premises within its area of jurisdiction, persons living in such premises are exempted from these taxes.

A form of direct taxation on property, earnings and profits similar to that in Hong Kong was introduced by the Inland Revenue Ordinance, 1960 with effect from 1st January 1961. This is a substitute for orthodox income tax and consists of four separate taxes:-viz. Property Tax, Salaries Tax, Profits Tax (sub-divided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax), Interest Tax.

The Ordinance provides that Property Tax shall not come into operation until such time as the Governor with prior approval of Council Negri shall appoint. This tax is not yet in operation, as such approval has not yet been given.
Salaries Tax is charged on the net income from employment after deducting a personal allowance of $3,000, allowance of $2,400 for a wife and children's allowances up to a maximum of $2,100 for five or more children. There are additional allowances in respect of children being educated outside Borneo. The rate of tax commences at 4% on the first $5,000 of the chargeable income and increases for each additional $5,000 of chargeable income to a maximum of 30% when the chargeable income exceeds $45,000. There is a provision however which restricts the total tax chargeable to 5% of the total income before deduction of any allowances.

Corporation Profits Tax is levied at a rate of 30% on the total net profits of corporations carrying on business in Sarawak. Business Profits Tax is similarly levied at a rate of 5% on other businesses but for these a tax free allowance of $4,000 is given where the net profits do not exceed $15,000; this allowance diminishes thereafter by $1 for every $2 of net profits so as to disappear at $23,000.

Interest Tax is levied at 5% on all interest paid or payable except when interest is payable to a corporation carrying on business in Sarawak. Interest from Saving Bank Accounts is also exempt from interest tax if the rate of interest does not exceed 2½%.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1956 | $51,434,042 | $43,374,437 |
| 1957 | $52,163,917 | $50,587,351 |
| 1958 | $60,045,667 | $57,957,444 |
| 1959 | $70,371,167 | $64,944,932 |
| 1960 | $84,484,062 | $83,304,790 |

The main heads of revenue and expenditure in 1960 were: Revenue derived from Customs import and export duties $45,115,660; Licences, Taxes and Internal Revenue other than Income Tax $4,092,185; Forest royalties and permits $5,207,926; Interest on Investments $2,333,981; Income Tax $12,401,561; Expenditure—Contribution to Development Fund $27,589,180; Constabulary $4,270,425; Education $9,758,830; Medical $6,038,110; Administration $2,764,809; Lands and Surveys $2,659,764; Public Works $7,031,270.

### Public Debt

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st December 1960 amounted to $25,311,153; the value of the sinking funds being $192,160. The Public Debt is made up of:

- $10 debentures—$1,745,604 (1/10th redeemable annually at $14).
- 5¼% Registered Stock (1966–68)—$3,000,000 (Sinking Fund $89,332).
- 6¼% Stock (1975–80) (Brunei Government)—$20,565,549 (Sinking Fund $102,828).

### Currency

The legal tender of Sarawak is currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. The former Sarawak currency ceased to be legal tender with effect from 31st December 1952 but may still be exchanged, as an act of grace, for legal tender at par.

The value of the Malay dollar is 2s. 4d. sterling.

### Development Plans

Owing to improved financial position a review of the Development Plan 1959–63 was undertaken in 1960 and as a result a Supplement to the Development Plan 1959–63 providing an additional expenditure of $38,736,226 up to 1963 was approved by Council Negri in August 1960. The total proposed expenditure on the Development Plan for the period 1959–63 amounts to $153,681,834 which is divided as follows:

| Category          | Amount     |
|-------------------|------------|
| Agriculture       | $36,324,884|
| Forestry          | $870,000   |
| Communications    | $53,121,174|
| Fuel and Power    | $4,600,000 |
| Education         | $19,126,403|
| Medical and Health| $9,541,792 |
| Water Supplies    | $9,063,830 |
| Miscellaneous     | $21,032,851|

The Plan is financed by Colonial Development and Welfare grants, local revenue appropriations, accumulated surplus balances, rubber cess and loan funds.

The aims and objects of the Plan are to develop the economy of Sarawak and to improve and expand social services within the capabilities of the country to meet the resulting increase in operating cost. Sarawak's economy depends mainly on agricultural exports, of which rubber is the most important. A considerable amount is included in the Plan for the planting of high-yielding rubber which is the largest single scheme and which is partly financed by the imposition of a 2 cents per lb. rubber cess. The provision for communications, which accounts for 34·5% of the Plan, is to be spent on roads, port developments, aviation, waterways and telecommunications.

### Other Development

Industrial development is mainly in the hands of private enterprise, notably the oil, bauxite and timber industries, but manufacturing industries are still on a very limited scale. Industrial development is encouraged, not only by the improvement of communications and other basic facilities, but also by exemptions from import duty and by tax concessions. This encouragement has been given legal form in the Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Ordinance. Since the Ordinance came into force in 1957 thirteen pioneer industries have been declared. These include cement, metal containers, veneer, plywood, venetian blinds, knitted products, rubber goods and latex foam goods, biscuits, fully refined sago flour, ramin moulding for export and printed batik cloth. Five companies have been declared pioneer manufacturers. At present most of the manufacturers granted pioneer status produce goods for the domestic market only. Government is also participating in the development of factory sites for industry, both directly and through the Sarawak Development Finance Corporation. The Borneo Development Corporation and Borneo Housing Development Limited—both subsidiaries of the Colonial Development Corporation—also play their part in encouraging industrial growth. The Government has spent a total of $211½ million from 1947 to 1960 on reconstruction and development.

### Education

At the end of 1960 there were 891 schools in Sarawak, of which 40 provided secondary education. The number of children in school was 104,047, of whom 94,773 were at the primary stage, 9,266 at the secondary stage and 8 were attending a vocational course. Of the total enrolment, 60,727 were Chinese pupils, representing 80·32%.
of the "school age population" (as defined by Unesco) of this group, 14,734 were Sarawak Malays, representing 43·13% of the school age population of this group and 27,747 belonged to the Dayak and other indigenous peoples, representing 30·44% of the school age population of these peoples. A small but growing number of secondary schools are under Government management; but 97·6% of the pupils in 1960 were in aided schools managed by Local Authorities, Chinese Committees of Management, Church and Missions and a few private committees. Slightly more than half the total number of pupils were in schools which use English as the main medium of instruction (with some use of indigenous languages in lower primary classes) and rather less than half were in schools using Chinese (Kuoyu) as the medium. Teacher-Training is carried on at Batu Lintang near Kuching for teachers using English and the vernacular as the medium and at Sibu in the Third Division for teachers using Chinese as the medium; both training colleges are residential.

A recent development in primary education has been the use of broadcast lessons to schools, especially for the teaching of English in rural native schools. Under a system of grants-in-aid introduced in 1956, for which all schools under local authorities and voluntary agencies are eligible, approved recurrent expenditure in aided schools, after deducting revenue from fees at prescribed rates, is met from central government funds with a small percentage contribution from local authorities. For approved capital expenditure, a percentage of the cost, normally between 40 and 60%, may be met from public funds. Total recurrent expenditure on education in 1960 (including expenditure on the Borneo Literature Bureau) amounted to $9,758,830 (about £1,138,720) which was approximately 17·6% of ordinary recurrent expenditure in the 1960 Budget. In addition a sum of $1,904,194 (about £222,192) was spent on educational schemes in the Development Plan.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Sarawak Museum, at Kuching, is the only one in Borneo. Its research activities are largely concerned with the anthropology and ethnology of the country. Archaeological excavations are also in progress. The Reference Library is housed in the Museum buildings; there are also a lending library and reading room at Kuching and Sibu.

Health

Health and sanitation in the towns are steadily improving but there is still much to be done in rural areas. A country-wide malaria eradication scheme is in operation which, it is hoped, may be completed by 1964.

With malaria under control and the possibility of eradication now in sight the commonest causes of illness are now the respiratory group of diseases, gastro-intestinal complaints, hook worm and round worm infections, leprosy, trachoma and endemic goitre.

As a result of a country-wide campaign in 1958, yaws is no longer commonly seen.

Special attention is being paid to the control of tuberculosis and leprosy while it is hoped in time to reduce the incidence of endemic goitre following the recent introduction of special plant for the iodisation of salt.

The total number of hospital beds available in Sarawak is approximately 1,700 of which some 200 are non-Government. 300 are for the treatment of mental diseases and a further 500 for those suffering from leprosy.

In addition to these hospital beds there are 30 static dispensaries throughout the country with a total of 212 "rest beds" for patients coming from a distance.

The medical needs of the more remote areas are provided by 12 travelling dispensaries on the various river systems and 54 "ulu" or up-country dressers.

There are 414 trained midwives in Sarawak of whom about 100 are serving as district midwives in up-country areas.

In the towns environmental sanitation is the immediate responsibility of Health Inspectors most of whom are in the service of local councils.

Actual recurrent expenditure on Medical Services for the year 1960 amounted to $5,890,972 which represents roughly 10% of the country's estimated annual expenditure.

Communications

The two main airports are situated at Kuching and at Sibu, the second largest town. Malayan Airways operate services linking Sibu and Kuching from Singapore to Brunei and North Borneo. An internal service is operated by Bornco Airways, a local company, with Twin Pioneer aircraft to Kuching, Simganggang, Sibu, Mukah, Bintulu, Miri, Marudi, Sematan and Long Akah. A new Government subsidised air service commenced during 1961 to Barito, a remote spot in the Kelabit uplands.

The sea and rivers remain the chief means of surface communication, although development of internal air services has recently been a feature of some importance. Work is progressing on various new road projects.

The total road mileage is about 705, consisting of 153 miles bitumen surfaced, 219 miles gravel surfaced and 333 miles dry-weather earth roads.

The figures for P.W.D. Maintained Roads in 1960 are as follows:

| Type                  | Miles |
|-----------------------|-------|
| Bitumen               | 103   |
| Gravel                | 49    |
| Dry weather earth     | 79    |
| **Total**             | **231** |

Regular services are maintained from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and East Australia to Sarawak ports. There are three vessels inwards to Kuching weekly from Singapore, one of which returns direct, the other two proceeding to Rejang River ports before returning to Singapore. The Rejang ports, Sarikei, Binatang and Sibu, also have a weekly link in each direction with Singapore and Brunei. Another service from Singapore calls at Kuching (Pending anchorage) and Miri en route to and from North Borneo, every two weeks. The service from Hong Kong is fortnightly, from Japan every six weeks and the ships from East Australia, coming via North Borneo and Bangkok, call every three weeks.

There are several other frequent callers whose service is not scheduled. They mainly carry the bulk imports, such as rice and maize from Siam and Cambodia, clearing outwards in ballast. The scheduled vessels carry general cargo inwards and a lesser tonnage outwards of cargo such as rubber, pepper and sago.
Ships of the above categories seldom exceed 2,000 tons gross since no Sarawak port has alongside facilities for larger ships.

Ocean going vessels, loading at anchorages or sea berths, carry most of Sarawak's export tonnage but seldom bring import cargo. Certain localities are engaged entirely in the handling of one commodity. Tankers load bulk oil at Miri sea-lines, Tanjong Mani anchorage in the River Rejang is the centre of the timber export trade, and at Sematan, bulk bauxite is loaded during the good weather season from April to September.

Sarawak's coastal trade is carried out by numerous locally built wooden craft of light draught, with the exception of one better class steel coaster which carries cargo and passengers between Kuching and Rejang ports, the round trip taking 3½ days.

The number and tonnage of overseas and neighbouring territories vessels calling at Sarawak ports during 1960 were as follows:

Arrivals . . 3,757; Tonnage 4,460,083
Departures . . 3,641; Tonnage 4,335,216

Broadcasting

The Sarawak Broadcasting service (Radio Sarawak) was inaugurated in 1954 and now broadcasts in English, Malay, Chinese and Iban for approximately 14 hours daily, on two short wave transmissions (7½ kW. and 5 kW.) and on two medium-wave transmissions (10 kW. and 5 kW.). Studios, programme and administrative offices are at Broadcasting House in central Kuching. The transmitting station is about 1½ miles and the receiving station 4½ miles away. High quality medium wave coverage is given within a radius of 60 miles of Kuching and short-wave reception is clear throughout Borneo and in other neighbouring countries in South-East Asia. About 40,000 licences are in current issue.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population are engaged in agricultural pursuits; the indigenous tribes are almost all padi farmers but also frequently cultivate small rubber or sago plantations and collect jungle produce such as rattan, jelutong and damar (resin). The Chinese agriculturists rely on rubber and pepper. Malays and Melanau are largely employed in sago and timber, whilst Ibans, when not busy on their padi farms, are employed as log extractors in the forest, on road work or as unskilled labour in the oilfields. Numbers employed in the principal industries are:

- Sawmills . . . 6,726
- Oilfields . . . 1,223
- Rubber Estates (excluding smallholders) . . 985
- Cutch . . . 55
- Jelutong . . . 225
- Road and Building Construction . . 2,437
- Mining and quarrying . . 179
- Bauxite mining . . 357
- Gold mining . . 131

Total . . 12,328

On 31st December 1960 the total number of registered Trade Unions in Sarawak is shown as 38.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural export products are rubber, pepper and sago. Rice, coconuts, tapioca, maize, coffee, fruit and vegetables are grown for local consumption. Local rice production is inadequate to meet local needs and there are considerable imports of rice, wheat flour in the form of bread and noodles is used to supplement rice requirements.

Livestock are not plentiful and animal husbandry still plays only a small part in the rural economy. Pigs are kept by the Chinese and Dayaks and this aspect is developing.

Both marine and freshwater fisheries are of considerable importance, but production is inadequate to meet local needs, although the culture of fresh-water fish is increasing and there are considerable imports of salted and tinned fish.

The Colony's present mineral products are bauxite, oil, gold, phosphate (guano), bricks, lime, stone and gravel. Past production has also included coal, antimony, mercury and diamonds. Reconnaissance geological surveys have revealed small amounts of other minerals, but none which appears at present to warrant further investigation. Prospecting is now concentrated on oil (in off-shore areas), coal, bauxite and gold.

There are many small factories processing rural products scattered throughout the more accessible parts of the country—particularly rice mills and rubber smokehouses; sago factories are mainly confined to the sago-growing areas, and there are a number of mills for production of coconut oil to meet the internal trade.

Principal Exports by Quantity and Value

| Item          | 1938 | 1959 | 1960 |
|---------------|------|------|------|
| Rubber        | tons | 17,988 | 43,836 | 49,961 |
| Pepper        | tons | 3,013 | 8,350 | 4,099 |

| Mineral Oil(a)| tons | 897 | 5,358 | 4,426 |

(a) Crude oil is piped to the refinery in Sarawak from the adjoining territory of Brunei and constitutes most of the output. Crude oil from wells in Sarawak (59,400 tons in 1960 and 54,700 tons in 1959) is also treated at the same refinery and both crude and refined petroleums are included in the total exports.

In 1960 40·8% of domestic exports went to Singapore; 4·9% to the United Kingdom; 19·1% to other Commonwealth countries and 35·2% to other countries. In the same year 54·1% of imports originated in Brunei (crude oil for refining and subsequent re-export); 11·3% in the United Kingdom; 13·4% in other Commonwealth countries; and 21·2% in other countries.

The chief imports, other than oil from Brunei, are foodstuffs, textiles, tobacco, beverages and manufactured goods.
Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing boards or statutory marketing organizations. Government provides facilities for the purchase of padi at a fixed floor price at a number of points scattered throughout the country. Control over the standard grading of sago and pepper for export is also exercised by Government.

Co-operative development was started in 1949 and has made steady progress. By 31st August 1961 there were 185 co-operative societies on the Register engaged in the following business:

- Marketing (Vegetables) 2; Padi Savings 40; Padi Milling 22; Consumers Stores 24; Credit and Savings 89; Miscellaneous 6; Secondary (including Bank) 2.

These societies are distributed through all Divisions except the Fifth and are composed of Malays, Melanaus, Land Dayaks, Sea Dayaks, Kenyahs, Kayans and Chinese.
