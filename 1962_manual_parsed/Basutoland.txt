BASUTOLAND

Area
Comprises an area of 11,716 square miles of which about one quarter in the west is lowland country varying in height above sea level from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, the remaining three quarters being highlands rising to a height of 11,425 feet in the Drakensberg Range, which forms the eastern boundary with Natal.
Population

In 1956 (the date of the last census) the population figures for Maseru township were: Africans 5,739, Europeans 590, Mixed Race 57 and one Asian.

A census of all races held in April 1956 gave the following figures for the population present in the Territory: Africans 638,857; Europeans 1,926; Persons of Mixed Race 644; and Asians 247. The census also gave the additional figures of 154,782 as an estimate of the number of Africans temporarily absent from the Colony for work and other purposes. The estimated total population of Basutoland in July 1961 was 697,000 with an additional 130,000 absent from the Territory. (By way of comparison, a census of 1875 gave a total of 469 Europeans and 127,707 Africans in Basutoland.)

Principal Towns

The capital is Maseru, which has an estimated population of about 10,000. The other principal towns are: Butha Buthe, Leribe, Mafeteng, Mokhotlong and Qachas Nek.

Geographical Features

The Colony of Basutoland is an enclave within the Republic of South Africa, its boundaries running with those of Natal to the east, the Cape Province to the south and the Orange Free State to the north and west. It lies between latitudes 28° 35' and 30° 40' south and longitudes 27° 00' and 29° 30' east. The mountain ranges run from north to south and those in the central area, named the Maluti, are spurs of the main Drakensberg which they join in the north, forming a high plateau varying in height from 9,000 to 10,500 feet. In this area two of the largest rivers in the Republic, the Orange and the Tugela, and tributaries of the Caledon, have their source.

Climate

Rainfall is variable and averages approximately 29 inches a year over the greater part of the country. Most of it falls between October and April, but there is normally no month which has less than half an inch. Unfortunately, river discharge statistics show that most of this water is lost to Basutoland in the form of run-off. The deciding factors from an agricultural point of view are whether the rain comes in steady soaking showers at intervals suited to the growth of the staple crops or whether it comes in the form of short and heavy storms, running to waste and eroding the soil. Serious droughts, like the one of 1948-49 are rare and there are a large number of perennial streams, though not so many as existed some years ago. In the lowlands the temperatures vary from a maximum of 90° or more in summer to a minimum that rarely drops below 20° in winter: in the highlands the range is much wider and temperatures below zero are common.

History

The Basotho as a nation did not come into prominence until 1818 when Moshesh, a minor chief of the Bakoena tribe in Northern Basutoland, gathered together the remnants of the various clans that had been scattered by the raids of the Zulu and Matebele.

The new nation went through a period of struggle, first with the emigrant Boers of the Great Trek, then with the British. From 1856 until 1868 there was a series of wars with the Orange Free State burghers, Moshesh lost a large portion of his country and repeatedly sought the protection of the British Government.

In 1868 the Basotho became British subjects and the boundaries of the Territory were defined by the Cape of Good Hope Notice of 13th May 1870.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition until it was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1871. The people never took kindly to the Cape Colonial rule and in 1880, after various disturbances, the Governor of the Cape extended to Basutoland the provisions of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, which included a clause for the general disarmament of the Basotho. They refused to accept the terms, and, after a war lasting nearly a year, the Act was repealed, several chiefs would not submit, and it was decided to hand over the administration to the Imperial Government. This was effected by Order in Council of 2nd February 1884.

Constitution

Before the introduction of constitutional reforms in March 1960 Basutoland was governed under a loose-knit system by which the British Administration combined with an hereditary Chieftainship. The Basotho owe allegiance to a single Paramount Chief under whom there is a hierarchy of Chiefs and Headmen. These Chiefs and Headmen are the authorities with whom the ordinary people deal in their daily affairs, and are responsible for the day to day administration of the Territory.

The Head of the Administration is the Resident Commissioner, who works under the direction of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland.

In 1910 an advisory body known as the Basutoland Council consisting of the Resident Commissioner as President, the Paramount Chief as Chief Councillor and 99 Basotho nominated members, was constituted by Proclamation. The Council evolved gradually and an elected element, 42 in number, was introduced in 1957.

In 1943 District Councils, consisting in the main of nominated members and a small number of elected members, were established as advisory and consultative bodies.

In September 1955 the Basutoland National Council passed a motion requesting “that the Basutoland Council be given power to make laws in all internal matters, such laws to be confirmed by the Paramount Chief”. In May 1956 the Secretary of State invited the Council to submit detailed recommendations for an advance in constitutional status. Agreement on a new constitution was reached at the end of 1958 and this was brought into operation in March 1960.

The new constitution provides for an Executive Council, which is advisory to both the High Commissioner and the Paramount Chief, and a Legislative Council known as the Basutoland National Council.

The Executive Council consists of the Resident Commissioner, who acts as Chairman, the Government Secretary, Finance Secretary, Assistant Attorney-General, three persons chosen by the Basutoland National Council from among their own number and one person nominated by the Paramount Chief.

The Basutoland National Council consists of 80 members, divided equally between elected and non-elected members; the former being elected
from among the members of District Councils by the District Councils sitting as electoral colleges for that purpose. The non-elected element is made up of the three official members of the Executive Council (excluding the Chairman), the Commissioner for Local Government, the 22 Principal and Ward Chiefs and 14 nominees of the Paramount Chief. The Council has power to legislate for all persons in Basutoland in respect of all matters, save the following, which are the High Commissioner's matters:

External Affairs and Defence; Internal Security; Currency, Public Loans, Customs and Excise; Copyright, Patents, Trade Marks and Designs; Posts (including Post Office Savings Bank), Telegrams, Telephones, Broadcasting and Television; the recruitment, appointment, conditions of service, promotion, discipline and retirement (including pensions) of officers in the Public Service.

In respect of legislation within the High Commissioner's field, the Basutoland National Council will continue to act as a consultative body and all matters will be referred to it.

National elections under the new constitution were held in January 1960 to elect the 162 members of the nine District Councils. The results were:

- Basutoland Congress Party . . . . . . 72
- Independents . . . . . . 52
- Basutoland National Party . . . . . . 22
- Marema-Tlou . . . . . . 16
- Basutoland Progressive Association 0

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are Basuto tax, income tax and poll tax (payable by all male adult persons who do not pay Basuto tax).

The principal sources of indirect revenue are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Basutoland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades and businesses. There are also death duties, stamp duty and a wool and mohair export duty.

Public Finance

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| £       | £           |
| 1957–58 | 1,549,433   | 1,593,778   |
| 1958–59 | 1,637,792   | 1,792,336   |
| 1959–60 | 1,803,900   | 2,139,302   |
| 1960–61 | 1,865,866   | 2,393,928   |
| 1961–62 | 1,999,551   | 3,208,382   |

Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1961–62:

- Customs and Excise . . . . . . 1,020,000
- Taxes and duties . . . . . . 471,000
- Posts and telegraphs . . . . . . 84,220

As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the Territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved grant-in-aid of £1,153,000 for 1961–62.

Currency

The currency is the same as in the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 Sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).

Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1959 Basutoland received an allocation of £1·2m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959–64. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:

- Soil conservation and agriculture . . . . . . £400,000
- Medical services . . . . . . 143,000
- Education . . . . . . 119,000
- Roads and airfields . . . . . . 104,000
- Water and electricity supplies . . . . . . 95,000

A further allocation of £418,000 was made in 1961 for development to March 1963. This will be used principally towards Education, Medical, Agriculture and Veterinary services.

Education

African education is largely in the hands of three missions (Paris Evangelical, Roman Catholic and Anglican), under the direction of the Education Department. Grants-in-aid are paid by Government to the three missions to cover the salaries of all teachers on the approved grant-in-aid list. In many aided schools of the Roman Catholic mission, assistance is given by unaided teachers, particularly Sisters. Small grants are paid from territorial funds to improve the equipment in primary schools. The total expenditure on grants-in-aid during 1960 was £290,099.

There are 1,110 schools and institutions in the Territory, of which all but 14 are under mission control; and of these mission schools 942 are either wholly or partly aided. The total enrolment in primary schools is 136,111. The average number of pupils per teacher is 54. In secondary schools the enrolment is 1,836; in teacher training schools 536; in technical schools 188; and in housecraft or craft schools 506.

The only institution providing post-secondary education in the Territory is the Pope Pius XII College at Roma, which is aided by a small Government grant. In 1960 it had an enrolment of 131 male and 36 female students. The college provides courses leading to the B.A. and B.Sc. and B.Comm. degrees and to the University Education Diploma of the University of South Africa.

All primary education is free and bursaries are provided for all stages of secondary, teacher training and University work. One Mosuto was studying at the University College of Fort Hare in 1960. Six bursars, including one woman, were undergoing medical training at the Durban Medical School. Twenty Basotho were studying at Universities and other institutions in the United Kingdom. One was studying in Southern Rhodesia, three at American universities and three in India. An increasing number of Basotho are being appointed to responsible posts in the Education Department; three Education Officers, three Assistant Education Officers and a Female Education Officer are now Basotho.
Health

The Government Medical staff of the Territory consists of a Director of Health, 20 Medical Officers, one Medical Officer of Health and one Assistant Medical Officer, one Medical Officer for Mental Health and one Surgical Specialist. There are nine Government hospitals, staffed by European Nursing Sisters with subordinate African staff. There is accommodation for 587 patients in the Government hospitals. A 200 bed Government hospital in Maseru, which with the gracious consent of Her Majesty has been named the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, was officially opened on the 25th July 1957. There are four mission hospitals subsidized by the Government, with a total accommodation of 338 beds. Health centres in mountain dispensaries provide outpatient medical facilities, and, where a trained African nurse is a member of the staff, maternity services to people living in remote areas. During 1960 17,795 patients were admitted to Government hospitals and 5,351 to mission hospitals. During the period 1937 to 1960 the outpatients at both Government and Mission dispensaries and clinics increased from 110,807 to 604,490. The Leper Settlement, four miles out of Maseru, had 318 patients at the end of 1960.

The principal diseases are venereal disease, chronic rheumatism, malnutrition, infections of the respiratory tract and dyspepsia. The heaviest toll of lives in children is due to tuberculosis, malnutrition, diphtheria, whooping-cough and gastro-enteritis. The incidence of nutritional and deficiency diseases is comparatively high and is allied to maize being the staple food. Typhus, plague and smallpox occur only rarely, and then in sporadic form, while diphtheria, typhoid fever, measles and whooping cough are endemic.

Communications

The Territory is linked with the railway system of the Republic of South Africa by a short branch-line from Maseru, the capital, to Marseilles on the Bloemfontein-Natal main line. One mile of this line is in Basutoland. The South African Railway runs near the boundaries of the Territory and goods are transported by road to the nearest railway station across the border.

The Road Motor Transport Department of the South African Railways runs regular services between Foursburg and Butha-Buthe, Zastron and Quthing, Zastron and Mohale's Hoek, and Quthing and Sebapala, and within the Territory in the lowland areas there are a number of bus services owned and operated by Basotho.

The greater part of Basutoland is very mountainous and in this area all transport is by pack animals. A new mountain motor road running eastwards from Maseru into the mountains has been constructed in order to open up the interior and facilitate its development and administration. The road has reached a point 80 miles from Maseru.

On the western side of Basutoland a fairly good road system has been developed in the strip of agricultural country running from north to south. The main roads traverse the whole of this area, with branches leading west to the principal points of exit. From the main roads a number of feeder-roads lead towards the foothills.

Principal Occupations

Basutoland is a pastoral country without factories or industrial undertakings, and since the produce of the land is insufficient to support the total population, many able-bodied Basotho leave the Territory each year to take up employment in the Republic of South Africa. The Government protects labourers by forbidding recruitment for any mine or other concern where the conditions of work are not good. All labourers recruited by agents in Basutoland for work outside the Territory have to be attested before an official and the contract must be according to Government Regulations.

Main Crops and Products

So far there has been little evidence of any exploitable mineral deposits in the Territory, but recent prospecting for diamonds has shown encouraging results. For the present, agriculture and animal husbandry are Basutoland's main sources of wealth. The chief exports at present are wheat, wool and mohair. It is estimated that 1,000,000 acres are under cultivation.

The soils in the mountain areas are of basaltic origin, while those in the lowlands are derived mainly from underlying cave sandstone. In the lowlands the soil has been cropped continuously for upwards of 80 years. Due to the absence of fuel, practically all cattle manure is burnt, so that little or no organic matter is returned to the land. Thus with increasing population, both human and livestock, excessive demands have been made on the soil, which has lost its structure and become subject to serious erosion. The soils in the mountains which have been brought into cultivation comparatively recently are rich though shallow. Controlled grazing has brought back a grass cover and has effectively halted the loss of soil by storm water run off in the mountain areas. In 1960 some 1,249,000 trees were planted as part of soil conservation measures.

In 1960 there were 331,200 head of cattle and 1,037,300 sheep in the Territory. Wool, followed by mohair, hides and skins, continue to be the main source of cash income from the animal population.

Trade

Basutoland has no industries and imports the consumer goods and capital items it needs as well as a certain amount of agricultural produce and livestock. Exports consist almost entirely of agricultural commodities and livestock, the main exports being wool and mohair, followed by wheat, sorghum and cattle. The value of imports usually exceeds the value of exports but the adverse balance is partly offset by the export of labour to the Republic of South Africa.
