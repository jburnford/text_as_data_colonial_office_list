SEYCHELLES

Area
Its land area is approximately 100 square miles, exclusive of Aldabra Lagoon estimated to cover about 55 square miles.

Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad and is estimated to cover 55½ square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.

Population
The 1960 census totalled 41,425.

Principal Town
Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 10,500.

Geographical Features
The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over seventeen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate
In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the past 58 years is 91·10 inches and the mean temperature was 84·5°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.

History
The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May 1794 when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Ile de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution
The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. Under a 1960 Order in Council the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, four ex officio members, five elected and three nominated members of whom at least one must be an unofficial. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy
All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation
The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. This is chargeable on all earned or investment income arising in or derived from the Territory. In addition tax is payable by residents on investment income arising out of the Colony or on earned income remitted thereto, the basis of assessment being income arising in the calendar year preceding year of assessment.

Rates of tax, after deduction of allowances, are:

- 5% on first Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 12½% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 25% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 30% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 40% on next Rs. 10,000 of chargeable income
- 50% on next Rs. 20,000 of chargeable income
- 60% on any excess over Rs. 50,000.
No tax is charged where the total income does not exceed Rs. 2,400. Companies, partnerships, etc., pay a flat rate of 35%.

Allowances are made to resident taxpayers:

- **Earned income** .. Rs. 1,500.
- **Personal (single)** .. Rs. 2,000.
- **Personal (married)** .. Rs. 3,500.
- **Children** .. Rs. 500 (max. Rs. 2,500).
- **Additional allowance** of Rs. 1,000 may be claimed for child over 11 years studying abroad.

**Dependent relative** .. Rs. 500 (limited to one relative) if relative is infirm, maintained by claimant and not in receipt of an income exceeding Rs. 500.

In addition, allowances may be claimed in respect of life insurance, superannuation, alimony and deductions against plant and machinery owned and operated by the assessee.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

### Libraries

Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust and there are small libraries run by the Co-operation Book Society, the Roman Catholic Mission and the Alliance Française.

### Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has very few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent and filariasis is infrequent. The incidence of leprosy is diminishing. That of intestinal infestation and amoebiasis continues high. A programme for improving sanitation in Victoria has been started. Tuberculosis is being dealt with by B.C.G. inoculation, starting with the schools.

The Public Heath Service is organized under the Medical Officer of Health and consists of nine Health Inspectors and six Health Visitors. Seven Health Inspectors are stationed in Mahé and two in Praslin. The Health Visitors, with one exception, are stationed in Mahé. There is one Health Visitor in Praslin.

There are infant welfare, antenatal and V.D. clinics at several centres on Mahé and Praslin and also on La Digue. An immunization centre at Victoria deals with yellow fever, diphtheria, T.A.B. and other inoculations. Dental facilities are available daily in Victoria, weekly at Anse Royale, fortnightly at Beolère and periodically on Praslin and La Digue.
A School Health Service was established in 1957 and covers all the schools in the Colony. School follow-up clinics are also arranged by the Public Health Nurses for the instruction of parents. Immunization of infants against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus was started in 1957 in all the infant welfare clinics.

The free issue of milk powder for infants (supplied by U.N.I.C.E.F.) commenced in June 1961 at 26 distributing centres in Mahé and 13 in Praslin and La Digue. These centres were staffed entirely by voluntary workers.

### Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 74 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15-20 feet. Tarmac surfacing is in progress, 34 miles having been completed.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 55 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. Passenger ships of the British India Line and of the Eastern Shipping Corporation combine at present to operate a service giving a call twice a month both eastwards and westwards in the case of the former line, and once a month both eastwards and westwards in the case of the latter line. The British India ships run from Durban to Bombay, and the Eastern Shipping Corporation operates from Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Bombay.

Occasional passenger-carrying cargo boats run directly from London (Brocklebank Line) or from Singapore (Royal Interocean Line).

### Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and wired broadcasting) Station at Victoria Road, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for two hours on a wavelength of 60·2 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 40 W. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

No receiving licences are issued.

### Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 6,500 are so employed. Approximate numbers employed in other occupations in 1960 were:

- Domestic service: 1,750
- Public Works: 2,500
- Public administration: 250
- Trade and commerce: 400

3. The General Workers' Union.
4. The Seychelles Teachers' Union.
5. The Seychelles Cable and Wireless Limited Staff Union.
6. The Seychelles Christian Workers Union.

### Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

An agricultural census was held in October 1960 when livestock was recorded as:—Cattle, 1,589; Goats, 260; Pigs, 3,058; Poultry, 21,673.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000–1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally-made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production has also commenced.
