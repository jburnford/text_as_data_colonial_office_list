THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE

Area

The Protectorate has not been surveyed as a whole, but its area is estimated at 225,000 square miles. The headquarters of the Protectorate Administration is at Mafeking, across the border in the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa.

Population

The last census was taken in 1956 and showed a population of 3,177 Europeans, 680 Coloured, 249 Asians and about 300,000 Africans.

The population is not evenly distributed, the bulk of the people living in the eastern part of the Protectorate with one fairly large tribe occupying the north-western corner. The central, western and southern areas of the territory, consisting for the most part of the Kalahari Desert, are extremely sparsely inhabited.

The Bechuana tribes tend to live in large villages or towns. About one-half of the population lives in towns of more than 1,000 inhabitants.

Principal Towns

Francistown, Gaberones, Kanye, Lobatsi, Maun and Serowe.

Geographical Features

The Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, on the south-east by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Southern Rhodesia, on the north by the Caprivi Zipfel and on the west by South West Africa. It lies between latitudes 18° and 37° south and longitudes 20° and 29° 50' east. The Kalahari Desert extends over most of the Protectorate west and south of Ngamiland as far as latitude 27°S. This is not a desert in the commonly accepted sense of the word, but consists of a vast expanse of undulating sand-belts with outcrops of limestone. In these limestone belts water is sometimes found at depths from 30 to 100 feet and it is possible that under the deep overburden of sand there may exist untapped reservoirs. The northern and south-western corners of the Kalahari have the least vegetation and most sand dunes, but elsewhere the grasses are excellent, and this is the natural habitat of the...
aboriginal Bushmen. Large areas are wooded like parklands with camel-thorn and other indigenous trees.

In the north-western part of the Protectorate the Okavango River, flowing inland from Angola, widens into a delta from which flood-waters, in seasons of heavy rainfall, flow as far south-east as the Makarikari salt-lake and south and southwest into Lake Ngami. The Chobe River, also flowing from Angola, inundates a large area in the north before flowing into the Zambesi 60 miles west of the Victoria Falls.

The mean altitude of the Protectorate is 3,000 feet and in the eastern portion occasional elevations, e.g. at Kanye, Scrowe and Ghanzi, reach 4,000 to 5,000 feet.

The Protectorate as a whole is a natural game-reserve for most species of the fauna of Africa and Government policy aims at their preservation.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical (latitude 22°S. passes through the centre of the Protectorate) but varies with latitude and altitude.

The average annual rainfall is 18 inches, varying from 25 inches in the north to 9 inches or less in the western Kalahari.

In the higher parts, days are pleasantly warm and the nights cold during the winter, but the summer is universally hot. In August seasonal winds blow from the west coast and, desiccated by the Kalahari, carry sand and dust across the whole country.

The atmosphere throughout the year is very dry and this helps somewhat to mitigate the high temperature.

History

In 1884 the British Government appointed a Deputy Commissioner to the Bechuana tribes and in 1885 the whole of the Bechuanaland was, with the concurrence of Khama and other principal chiefs, proclaimed to be under the protection of Her Majesty The Queen. The southern part of the territory, which included Mafeking, Vryburg and Kuruman, was at the same time constituted a Crown Colony with the title British Bechuanaland.

In 1885 British Bechuanaland was annexed to Cape Colony, subsequently the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. The northern part, known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate, has continued to be administered by the Government of the United Kingdom.

The administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is governed by various Orders in Council and Proclamations, of which the most important is the Order in Council of Her Majesty Queen Victoria dated 9th May 1891. That Order empowered the then High Commissioner for South Africa to exercise on Her Majesty's behalf all the powers and jurisdiction which Her Majesty had or might have within the Protectorate and to that end authorized him to take or cause to be taken all such measures as he might think expedient, subject to such instructions as he might from time to time receive from Her Majesty or through a Secretary of State. Other provisions of the Order empowered the High Commissioner to appoint administrative and judicial officers and to assign their functions to them subject to the preservation of his own powers in their entirety and to provide, by proclamation from time to time, for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue and the peace, order and good government of all persons within the Protectorate, including the prohibition and punishment of acts tending to disturb the public peace.

In issuing these proclamations the High Commissioner was instructed by the Order in Council to respect any Native laws and customs by which the civil relations of any Native chiefs, tribes or population under Her Majesty's protection were at that time (viz., in May 1891) regulated, except in so far as the same might be incompatible with the due exercise of Her Majesty's power and jurisdiction or which were repugnant to humanity.

The Order required the High Commissioner to publish his proclamations in the Gazette and reserved to Her Majesty the right to disallow any such proclamation. The Order also provided that, subject to any proclamation lawfully issued by the High Commissioner, any jurisdiction exercisable otherwise than under this Order in Council of 1891, whether by virtue of any Statute or Order in Council, or of any treaty, or otherwise, should remain in full force.

Her Majesty reserved the power to revoke, alter, add to or amend this Order at any time.

Constitution

The Protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland and is divided for administrative purposes into ten districts under District Commissioners who are assisted in the maintenance of law and order by a force of police.

The territory comprises Crown lands, blocks of European farms and tribal Reserves.

In the African areas the method of administration is that generally known as "indirect rule". Native administrations were formally established and the powers and rights of Native authorities were defined in the Native Administration and Native Courts Proclamations of 1943 (Caps. 56 and 5 of the Laws, Cap. 56 having now been replaced by Proc. No. 24 of 1956) which replace the original Proclamations 74 and 75 of 1934. In 1938 Native Treasuries were successfully established in all Reserves. Government pays 50% of each Native Administration's collection of native tax to the tribal treasury concerned; other sources of revenue are a graded tax and stand-rents. The Chiefs and Finance Committees, under the guidance of District Commissioners, are responsible for the preparation of estimates and general management of their treasuries.

On 28th July 1960 the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations announced his approval of proposals for a new constitution in the Protectorate. These proposals were promulgated by the Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) Order in Council, 1960, and provide for a Legislative Council with power to legislate for the Protectorate, subject to certain reserve powers remaining with the High Commissioner. The Legislative Council has an elected unofficial majority; there are 21 elected members, of whom 10 are European, 10 African and one Asian; there are also 10 Government officials and four nominated unofficial members. The European elected members are elected by European voters, subject to certain qualifications of age, residence and property or income; the Asian elected member is elected by Asian voters similarly qualified. The African elected members are elected by an African Council consisting of Chiefs
of the eight principal tribes, 32 members appointed by tribes assembled in Kgota or elected by the tribal or district councils where these exist, together with the official and appointed members. The Executive Council consists of six officials and four unofficials, two of whom are European and two African.

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are native tax, income tax, non-native poll tax and cattle export tax. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. The Bechuanaland Protectorate is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on all imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades, businesses and professions. There are also death duties.

| Public Finance | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
|               | £       | £           |
| 1957–58       | 967,434 | 1,633,717   |
| 1958–59       | 1,125,292| 1,612,932   |

| 1961–62       | 1,428,517| 2,642,103   |

Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1961–62:

- Customs and Excise: £346,000
- Taxes and duties: £490,150
- Posts and telegraphs: £223,020
- Revenue from Government property: £182,050

As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the Territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved a grant-in-aid of £1,157,000 for 1961–62.

Currency

During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R. 2; 1 shilling = 10 cents). The Standard Bank of South Africa and Barclays Bank (D.C.O.) each have branches at Francistown, Lobatsi and Mahalapye.

Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1959 Bechuanaland received an allocation of £1.5m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959–64. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:

- Agriculture and veterinary: £350,000
- Water supplies: £334,000
- Public building: £416,000
- Education: £208,000
- Roads: £137,650

A further allocation of £165,000 was made in 1961 for development to March 1963. This will be used principally towards Education, Public Works, Agriculture and Veterinary.

Education

There are eight main tribes in the Protectorate. Communications are primitive, distances great and financial resources far from commensurate with urgent needs. Consequently the administration and promotion of African education are unusually difficult.

Most of the administrative work has devolved upon eight tribal central school committees in addition to which there are four committees for non-tribal polyglot areas and in three remote areas education is administered directly by the District Commissioners concerned and the Department of Education.

Primary Education. Enrolled in the 179 African primary schools in the Protectorate during 1959 were 32,406 pupils of whom approximately 60% were girls. The disparity between the sexes, caused by the absence of boys at cattle-posts and on the land, has had a retarding influence ever since schools were first established.

Post-Primary Education. The Bamangwato College was re-constituted as a territorial institution under a Governing Council by Proclamation No. 26 of 1956. All tribes are represented on the Council. A Colonial Development and Welfare grant of £30,000 was made available for the building of a classroom block and this has now been completed. The Government now meets recurrent costs. A secondary boarding school is conducted by the Roman Catholic Mission at Khale, while junior secondary day schools exist at Kanye, Mochudi and Molepolole. The total secondary enrolment in 1959 was 431.

Teacher Training. A new teacher training college was completed and occupied in July 1956. Classroom accommodation was extended in 1958. This institution can accommodate at least 100 students, twice the number previously in training. Cost of the buildings, met from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, was over £45,000.

Youth Movements. There are 3,348 Boy Scouts, divided into 58 groups and 4,523 Girl Guides, in 80 groups. Monthly bulletins are issued to all Scout and Guide officers. A Government grant of £200 per year, divided equally between the two movements, is applied chiefly to training and travelling expenses.

For the small European community nine primary schools are conducted. At Ghanzi, the most remote European settlement in Southern Africa, a boarding school capable of accommodating 60 pupils was opened in 1953. Two other hostels were erected for boarders at Francistown and Lobatsi in 1957 and opened in 1958. The number of European pupils enrolled in Protectorate primary schools was 451 in 1959.

In view of the small school community which it would serve, there is no provision for secondary education for European children in the Territory; the need is partially met by the award of bursaries and grants to enable children to attend schools in neighbouring territories.

The total expenditure on educational service from funds controlled by Government by Native Administrations and by missions during the year 1959 was £324,806. Of this total £89,347 was contributed by Colonial Development and Welfare schemes.

Health

There are four Government hospitals and four Government Health Centres, together with 36
dispensaries, eight of which are staffed by resident dispensers. Various missions administer two hospitals and one Health Centre and 29 out-station dispensaries. These hospitals, health centres and dispensaries provide 854 beds, equivalent to one bed for approximately 348 of the population. During 1959 16,967 patients were admitted to hospitals and attendances for treatment as out-patients numbered 316,797, plus 157,183 attendances for vaccinations, inoculations, etc., making a total of 473,980. Maternity work, including ante-natal and post-natal care, is mainly carried out in the hospitals but there is a special maternity centre administered by the London Missionary Society and supervised by the Government Medical Officer of the District.

The technical staff consists of the Director of Medical Services, Medical Officer of Health, one Senior Medical Officer, 13 Medical Officers, three Health Inspectors, one Matron, four Sisters-in-Charge, one Sister Tutor and 11 European Sisters. There is a subsidiary African staff, trained, semi-trained and untrained. In addition there are six medical missionaries and subsidiary staff, both European and African.

African nurses are trained at both Government and Mission hospitals. Midwives are trained at the Government Hospital, Serowe, at the Maun Maternity Centre and the Molopole Mission. Nurses undergo a three-year course in general nursing, at the end of which they receive a year's training in midwifery.

African Sanitary Inspectors are trained under the supervision of the Health Inspectors.

Communications

The main railway line from Cape Town to the north runs through the Protectorate, entering it at Ramathlabama, 886 miles from Cape Town, and leaving it at Ramaquabane, 398 miles farther north. The line runs roughly parallel to the eastern boundary of the territory at an average distance from it of about 55 miles. The railway within the territory is owned by the Rhodesia Railways and the section Mahalapye/Ramathlabama is operated by the South African Railways Administration as agents. The gauge is 3 feet 6 inches.

The roads are almost exclusively of earth or sand, the only exceptions being short lengths of gravel, and, in two townships, bitumen surfaces over short distances. There is limited bridging over the main rivers.

Twenty-four landing-grounds and emergency strips are maintained in the Protectorate.

Principal Occupations

Over 95% of the population is engaged in stock raising. A few Africans are employed as drovers and herdsmen by European farmers but the great majority are themselves owners of livestock, which are cared for on a family or tribal basis. The principal occupations of the small number of African wage earners are:

- Government service ... 2,500*
- Agriculture ... 3,000
- Building ... 300
- Trade and industry ... 2,000
- Domestic service ... 2,000

* This figure includes approximately 1,000 casual labourers.

Main Crops and Products

The main occupation of the Bechuana is cattle raising. The number of cattle in 1959 was 1,317,236 of which 10,196 animals and 42,206,082 lb. of carcasses were exported. There were also 343,665 sheep, goats and pigs. Seasonal lack of water and grazing and indifferent animal husbandry are the chief handicaps to the expansion of the industry.

Irregular rainfall and primitive agricultural practices, aggravated by the migration of able-bodied men to work in the Republic are the cause of occasional crop failures. The principal crops are sorghum and beans.

A little gold and some kyanite are mined in the north-east, asbestos near Kanye in the Banwaketse Reserve and manganese in the Bangwaketse and Bamalete Reserves.
