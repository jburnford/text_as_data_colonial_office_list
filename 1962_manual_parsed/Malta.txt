Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a
thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1960 was 40° F. recorded on the 4th February, while the highest, 98° F., occurred on the 30th August. The mean temperature for 1960 was 66·7° F. and the mean annual rainfall was 12·92 inches. The mean annual rainfall at Valletta for the past ten years is 22·71 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In August the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12 June 1798 Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

Constitution

Following the resignation of Mr. Mintoff’s Government on the 24th April 1958, a State of Emergency was declared in Malta on the 30th April 1958, primarily to enable the Governor to continue the administration of Government in the absence of Ministers. A new constitution was introduced on the 15th April 1959 which is contained in the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959 and the Royal Instructions issued on the 30th March 1959.

Provision is made under the Constitution for an Executive Council, presided over by the Governor, consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Legal Secretary and the Financial Secretary as ex officio members and of such other nominated members (appointed by the Governor) of whom not less than three shall be persons holding a public office.

In accordance with Her Majesty’s Government’s undertaking that this constitution would be interim, a constitutional commission was appointed for Malta at the end of July 1960, to submit recommendations for a return to representative government. The commission’s report was published in February 1961 (Cmd. 1261) and a constitution based on its recommendations was promulgated on the 24th October 1961 as the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1961. The electoral provisions only of the Constitution were brought into force on 1st November 1961 and it was subsequently announced that elections would take place between the 17th and 19th February 1962. The remaining sections of the Constitution, including that providing for the appointment of a United Kingdom Commissioner, are to be brought into force by the Governor after the formation of an elected Government.

Land Policy

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

Taxation

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every £ of the first £200.
- 3s. for every £ of the next £300.

The funds of the "Massa Frumentaria" were in 1798 appropriated by the French Government then in occupation of the Island.

Under the Malta Treasury Bills Act, 1952, which has since been superseded by the Malta Treasury Bills Emergency Ordinance, 1958, the Government whenever authorized by Resolution of the Legislative Assembly, could raise money not exceeding the amount specified in such Resolution by means of three months' Treasury Bills. On 31st March 1961 the amount so raised was £1,415,000.

The Government is also empowered to issue loans up to £3,000,000 under the Local Loans (Registered Stock and Securities) Ordinance, 1959. In December 1959 £1,300,000 Local Development Registered Stocks were issued at £98 per cent. bearing 6% interest and in October 1960 a further £1,200,000 stocks were issued at £95 per cent. bearing 6% interest. Both amounts were fully subscribed.

Bank of England notes ceased to be legal tender in the Island in 1949. Maltese £1 and 10s. notes are on a par with sterling and £ for coverage is maintained at the Bank of England. The amount of local currency in circulation on 31st March 1961 was £22,292,000.

Development Plans

During the financial year ended 31st March 1961, a total of £4,336,659 was spent on development and other capital works.

Since the end of the War, direct aid by way of free grant from Her Majesty's Government to Malta has amounted to about £50 million, mainly in respect of capital expenditure including War Damage and Reconstruction grants.

The Five-Year Development Plan for the Maltese Islands covering the period 1959-64, which was published in October 1959, was reviewed towards the beginning of the third year. The Reviewed Plan was published in July 1961 and provides for an expenditure of over £35½ million of which £29½ million is being made available by Her Majesty's Government in loans and grants, including £19½ million from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. It is also hoped to secure a long term loan of £2·3 million from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance the cost of a new power station and distillation plant.

The Plan aims at diversifying the Maltese economy which has hitherto been largely sustained by the expenditure of the fighting Services; this expenditure is bound to decline because of changing defence policies and concepts. The measures contemplated in the Plan to achieve this end may be summarized as follows:

(a) The Harbour, which is Malta's leading natural asset, is to be developed by the conversion of the Dockyard to commercial use and by the construction of modern deep water quays and other port facilities. A £7½ million loan from Colonial Development and Welfare sources is being made for the Dockyard operation which has been entrusted to a United Kingdom firm of ship
repairers. Work on the new quays and other port facilities is well under way and it is expected that it will be completed by the end of 1961.

(b) Funds are provided for the building of a fully serviced industrial estate, work on which is now well advanced, and it is expected that some fourteen factories will have been built by March 1962. Capital loans and grants are also offered to industry, in addition to an income tax "holiday" and Customs duties easements available under the Aids to Industries Ordinance. An extensive publicity campaign undertaken by an Aids to Industries Board has drawn the attention of industrialists in the United Kingdom, on the Continent and elsewhere to the wide range of aid offered. The results have been very successful and some 20 projects for different industries have been approved. Besides these direct aids, the Plan also sets out to provide the basic services necessary for industrialization apart from the port already referred to above, i.e., the expansion of the water and electricity supplies (work on a new power station and water distillation plant is expected to be taken in hand this year) and the modernization and expansion of the telephone services. Technical Education is also to be developed in order to meet industry's increasing needs for skills. A Polytechnic is to be constructed and a grant of £100,000 has been secured from U.N.E.S.C.O. towards furniture and equipment.

(c) The tourist industry is being built up to take advantage of Malta's climatic, scenic and historical assets. The Capital loans and grants to industry referred to above will also be made available for hotels. The extension of essential services to hotel resort sites is being undertaken by the Government and for this purpose just under £1,000,000 is being provided.

(d) The two indigenous industries, agriculture and fisheries, are being assisted towards greater efficiency.

(e) Although the greater share of the funds is allocated to these economic objectives, substantial provision is made for the social services—primary and secondary education, health, housing, sewers and public buildings.

Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Primary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 114 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction, with an enrolment of 53,203 pupils; and six Grammar schools with 3,652 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1769, has an average attendance of 388 students and grants degrees and diplomas in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts and science. The number of Maltese studying or attending post-graduate courses in United Kingdom Universities or colleges during 1960 was 48. There are 31 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects with an attendance of 529 and 67 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 845. There are three Secondary Technical Schools providing five-year courses leading to G.C.E. and a Sixth Form for 1,288 pupils of whom 419 are girls. One Technical school for craft training—admission 14 to 17 years—provides a three-year course for 596 pupils. An apprenticeships school and a technical college provide five-year courses for 461 apprentices on the day release system. St. Patrick's Residential School caters for 90 boarders, age 9 to 15. The School of Art provides seven evening classes attended by 185 persons of all ages. Evening classes mainly for emigrants have an average attendance of 1,650 persons and 206 persons are undergoing accelerated full-time technical training in various trades, at two Government Industrial Training Centres in Malta and one in Gozo. These centres were started under the vocational training scheme for prospective migrants. There is a Government home for girls with an average total of 54 inmates. The total number of private (primary and secondary) schools is 88 with an attendance of about 18,444 pupils.

In 1960–61 expenditure on education was £1,547,012 (of which £537,396 was capital expenditure). Expenditure on education in 1935 was £149,521.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Royal Malta Library including the Juvenile Library has a stock of 56,172 works, the Gozo Public Library has 16,760. There are also 48 district circulating libraries in the various towns and villages (35 in Malta and 13 in Gozo).

The Museum at Valletta was closed during the war. The collections are being transferred to the Auberge de Provence where the National Museum was set up and opened to the public on 12th January 1958. The following museums and monuments are open to visitors:

During 1960–61 expenditure by the Medical and Health Department was £1,998,592, as compared with £628,271 in 1946–47.
Communications

The international airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station. There are other Service airfields at Hal Far and Ta' Qali. British European Airways operate the following scheduled services:—(a) Twenty one services a week to London. These call at Palermo or Ajaccio or Naples or Alghero or at Rome and Nice; (b) three services a week to Catania; (c) daily services to Tripoli; and (d) three services a week to Benghazi via Tripoli.

Skyways Limited, under a pooling agreement with British European Airways operate a scheduled service between Malta and London via Tunis twice weekly. British United Airlines operate coach class services once every two weeks between Malta and East and Central Africa, and freight services between Malta and East, Central and South Africa, and between Malta, Frankfurt and London.

During 1960, 2,650 aircraft offloaded 48,261 passengers and picked up 50,136 others. 38,589 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of Malta does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Ten miles of roads have been resurfaced with hot-laid bitumen macadam. Surfacing for main roads remains penetration macadam (semi-grouting) and 415 miles are paved in this method using limestone aggregate and bituminous emulsion; 157 miles of country and estate roads are paved in water-bound macadam.

The number and tonnage of ships which entered the Grand Harbour during 1960 are:—

- 2,021 Steamships, tonnage 3,273,916.
- 94 Sailing ships, tonnage 8,544.

There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a regular passenger service between Malta and the Continent calling at Syracuse, Catania and Naples. (Frequency: June–October every 3 days; September–May every 5 days) and the Laferla Shipping Line which runs a Service between Malta and Syracuse from April to mid-October (Frequency: varying 2 to 6 sailings per week according to traffic offering).

Broadcasting

Messrs. Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd. operate a wired sound broadcasting service which was first introduced in 1935. The number of subscribers on 31st July 1961 was 47,562. As on the same date there was a total of 22,041 licences for wireless receiving sets (including 12,629 television sets). Although there is as yet no television broadcasting station in Malta, Italian T.V. transmissions can be received; preparations are also far advanced for the setting up of a local station by Malta Television Service Limited.

In 1958 a Board was appointed by the Governor to organise political and other controversial broadcasting. This was wound up in September 1961 in anticipation of the setting up of the Malta Broadcasting Authority, a statutory public corporation which alone is vested with the function of providing, either directly or through contractors, both sound and television services in Malta. An Ordinance (No. XX of 1961) creating the Authority was enacted by the Governor on 29th July 1961 and was brought into force on 29th September 1961, as from which date the Authority was formally established.

Principal Occupations

The gainfully-occupied population (88,690) was engaged in 1960 in the following occupations: agriculture (7,520), fishing (600), stone quarrying and clay pits (630), manufacturing and mechanical (14,960), construction (7,890), commerce (11,860), communications (4,050), community, recreation and personal services (8,130), Government (17,000), dockyard and Service Departments, including local servicemen (15,930).

On 30th June 1960 there were 61 registered trade unions with a total membership of 29,776, fifteen combinations of employers with a membership of 2,221 and six combinations of employers and employees with a total of 2,409 members.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are potatoes, onions, grapes, wheat, barley and forages. Fresh vegetables and potatoes are the main cash crops.

The livestock population in 1960 was: Cattle 9,302; horses 1,875; donkeys 2,573; mules 1,672; sheep 13,016; goats 34,688; pigs 14,146; poultry 344,483; rabbits 52,545.

During 1960, 1,237 tons of fish were landed by local fishermen (mainly during the months between May and November) with a first sale value of £227,000.

Malta has to import nearly all the raw materials required for industry.

The two leading industries are the ship-repair yard—formerly a Royal Naval establishment privately operated since April 1959—and the building industry.

Besides a number of light industries produce, flour, macaroni, edible oil, tomato paste, canned fruits and vegetables, beer, soft drinks, wine; buttons, footwear, gloves, ladies’ handbags, knitwear, homespun lace, nylon socks and stockings, shirts and pyjamas, textiles, leather goods; cigarettes, pipes and other smoking requisites; candles, matches, paints, bituminous emulsion, mirrors, crown corks, nails and screws, neon-signs, refrigerators, boats, brooms; flowers and seeds.

Following the grant of assistance under the Aids to Industries Scheme, these new industries have been set up, namely: bacon; detergents; carnation and chrysanthemum cuttings; handmade imitation jewellery; expanded plastic materials; synthetic rubber seals; synthetic yarn processing; plastisol articles.

The Government currently grants exclusive rights to produce goods under the provisions of the Encouragement of New Industries Act only in those cases where the industry is of exceptional importance to the development of the economy of the Island.
