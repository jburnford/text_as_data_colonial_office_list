NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland)

Area

The area is 45,747 square miles of which 9,266 square miles is water. Of this, Lake Nyasa itself covers an area of 8,870 square miles.

Population

The estimated population at the 31st December 1960 was 2,860,000 divided approximately as follows:

- Europeans .......... 9,500
- Africans ............. 2,840,000
- Other Races ......... 13,200

The main tribal groups of the Africans are:

| Tribe          | Per cent. (approx.) |

Geographical Features

Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000-3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chiwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate

The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History

The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to "The
Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate" but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate". The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There were internal disturbances in 1915, known as the Chilembwe Rising, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges; and in 1953 disturbances in the Southern Province, attributed in large part to discontent over the African tenant system obtaining in privately-held estate land, resulted in the deaths of 12 Africans. In both cases rapid and successful counter-measures were taken.

In March 1959 following a number of disturbances throughout the country, a state of emergency was declared, and serious riots subsequently took place, particularly in the Northern Province. Reinforcements of troops and police were brought in from neighbouring territories and order was quickly restored.

The state of emergency was lifted in June 1960.

**Constitution**

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 131). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council and a Legislative Council whose present membership is shown on page 144.

Under the terms of the Nyasaland (Constitution) Order in Council, 1961, the Governor presides over an Executive Council of ten members of whom five are officials (three ex-officio and two appointed), the ex-officio members being the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary; the five unofficial members include three chosen from among the members of Legislative Council on the lower of the two electoral rolls and two from among those elected on the higher electoral roll. All members of the Council are styled Ministers and may be charged with responsibility for any department or subject. One or both of the appointed officials may be replaced by elected members if the Governor so recommends and the Secretary of State approves.

The Governor has power to appoint up to three Parliamentary Secretaries from among the elected members of the Legislative Council; if three are appointed at least two must be selected from members elected on the lower electoral roll.

The Legislative Council consists of 28 elected unofficial members and the five official members of the Executive Council. The 28 unofficial members are elected in single member geographical constituencies on a two-tier qualitative franchise containing members of all races. Twenty of these are elected in one set of constituencies by voters who satisfy lower qualifications and eight in another set of constituencies by voters who satisfy high qualifications.

The new constitution came into force in the summer of 1961 and a General Election was held on the 15th August.

**Land Policy**

Land policy is controlled so far as African Trust Land, which comprises 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Orders in Council, 1950 and 1955. Under these Orders in Council Africans may use and occupy African Trust Land not held under lease in accordance with the African law and custom prevailing in the area. The Orders in Council empower the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of State's sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

**Taxation**

A Poll Tax is payable by non-African males over 18 years of age, resident in the Protectorate, at the rate of £8 per annum. An African Tax is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. The rate with effect from the 1st January 1958 is 30s. per annum. Both the African and non-African Poll Tax can be set off against any Territorial surcharge paid by the individual concerned.

Income Tax and Customs and Excise duties are assessed and collected by the Federal Government, which took over direct responsibility for them on the 1st April 1954.

Rates of Income Tax (1960–61) rise from 9d. in the £ on the first £500 of chargeable income to 5s. 5d. in the £ in excess of £2,500 for married persons. No income tax is payable on incomes of less than £800 in the case of married persons or £400 in the case of single persons. There are primary rebates of £37 10s. and £25 respectively for married and single persons and rebates for children, dependants, blind persons and food farmers and in respect of insurance premiums and benefit fund contributions. Private Companies pay tax at 5s. 5d. in the £ on the first £25,000 of taxable income or profits and 6s. 8d. in the £ in excess of £25,000. Companies other than Private Companies pay tax at 6s. 8d. in the £.

Supertax is levied (after an allowance of £4,000 for married persons and £2,000 for single persons) on taxable income plus dividends received by residents of the Federation from all sources. Non-residents of the Federation are not liable to supertax on dividends received from companies incorporated in the Federation unless they carry on business there. Certain external companies as defined in the income tax law are also subject to supertax.

The rates of supertax for married persons are 2s. 4d. in the £ for the first £1,000 of supertax income (i.e., the fifth £1,000 of taxable income)
rising to 4s. 1d. in the £ over £6,000. For single persons the supertax rate is 1s. 7d. for the first £1,000 of supertax income (i.e. the third £1,000 of taxable income) to 4s. 1d. over £6,000.

A tax is levied on the undistributed profits of private companies as defined in the income tax law, at the rate of 2s. 9d. in the £ on the first £2,000 of the undistributed profits and at the rate of 5s. in the £ on the remainder.

On all tax payable a surcharge is raised by the Territorial Government amounting to 20 per cent. of the Federal tax payable by both persons and companies.

**Currency**

The Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was established in 1956 and issues the Federal currency. Southern Rhodesia currency continues also as legal tender for the present. United Kingdom coins ceased to be legal tender as from 1st January 1955.

**Development Plan**

The existing capital development plan will be virtually completed by 30th June 1962 and a new plan is in the process of being prepared.

Liaison is maintained with the other three Governments in the Federation. The following is a summary of the distribution of funds provided in the Estimates on Development Account, 1961–62:

| Item                                           | Percentage |
|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Administrative Buildings                       | 9          |
| Housing                                        | 5          |
| Public Works                                   | 14         |
| Education and Social Welfare                   | 9          |
| Police                                         | 15         |

| Rural Development                              | 4          |
| Miscellaneous                                  | 1          |

The current plan aims at a balanced programme of development of natural resources and urban services. A major project among the former is a scheme for land re-organization designed to introduce improved methods of land usage in selected areas. Included in the projects for urban development is the provision of funds for an entirely new water supply for Blantyre/Limbe. The programme for Education is being intensified, with particular emphasis upon teacher training and secondary education. With the help of a direct grant from the United Kingdom Government a programme of capital development is proceeding to provide buildings and equipment for an expanded Police Force and for the closer administration of the Territory.

**Education**

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

In 1960 there were 35 Government schools (one of which was a secondary school) and four private schools. These schools catered for 5,073 children; of these 502 were receiving secondary education.

In 1960, 3,181 primary school streams catered for 285,163 African pupils; 1,090 of these school streams were grant-aided and staffed by qualified teachers, the balance were conducted by the various missionary bodies without assistance from public funds.

Three Government secondary school streams at Dedza and Mzuzu had a total enrolment of 285. Four other full secondary school streams and twelve junior secondary school streams, in schools assisted from public funds, provide accommodation for 991 pupils. Five unaided secondary school streams had an enrolment of 225. Of these pupils 23 were in Higher School Certificate classes.
There are eight assisted and one unassisted Teacher Training Colleges, in addition to the Government Teacher Training College at Domasi. At these 930 students underwent teacher training in 1960.

A Trade School conducted by the Department of Education gave instruction to 53 pupils in 1960. The Government also assisted trade schools at missions and technical and vocational training for both boys and girls was given at a number of aided and unaided schools. A second Government trade school is planned.

Expenditure on Education in the year 1960 was just under £1,177,000.

Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre for both Africans and Europeans, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

Public Health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

The principal diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur, but there has recently been a severe outbreak in the Centre Province. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, re-appeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952 but again subsided.

There is 1 Central Hospital, 1 General Hospital, 14 District Hospitals, 5 Rural Hospitals and 2 Special Hospitals—1 Mental and 1 Leprosy—with accommodation for 280 and 458 persons respectively.

Each Hospital has a number of satellite health centres of which there are 112.

There are beds for Europeans and Asians in the Central Hospital, the General Hospital and one of the District Hospitals.

Mission Hospitals provide 1,742 beds, inclusive of maternity beds.

The total admissions and out-patient attendances for Europeans, Asians and Coloureds and Africans at the end of December 1959 were:

| In-patients | Out-patients |
|-------------|--------------|
| Europeans   | 1,408        |
| Asians and Coloureds | 777         |
| Africans    | 70,984       |
|             | 16,786       |
|             | 9,450        |
|             | 2,114,637    |

Expenditure on health services during the financial year ending June 1960 was £900,247.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial roads and other aspects of communications.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and 12 out-station airfields at eight of which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Federal Director of Meteorological Services and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzimba. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways and East African Airways each operate a weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 273 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka, south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. From January to October 1960, 1,040,194 tons of freight and 491,452 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 6,184, of which just over 249 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay–Chipoka–KotaKota–Likoma Island–Chintech–Nkata Bay–Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika)–Ruarwe–Florence Bay–Deep Bay–Manda (Tanganyika)–Ngara–Kaporo (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting

A significant milestone in the development of the territory's communications media was reached in March 1960 when the Federal Broadcasting Corporation established a regional station in Nyasaland. At first a 400 watt transmitter was operated in the 90 metre band but this was replaced in May by a 2½ kilowatt transmitter in the 76 metre band, which was received satisfactorily in all areas of the Protectorate. The transmitter was operated by the Federal Ministry of Posts, under an agreement with the F.B.C., at the Post Office transmitting station near Zomba. By the end of the year the Corporation was considering the possibility of installing a 10 kilowatt transmitter further to improve reception in the Protectorate.

Programmes originated at the Blantyre Studio were sent by landline and V.H.F. link to the transmitter. The station was on the air for 3 hours per day with programmes in Nyanja and English. Programmes in Tumbuka (for the Northern Province) were broadcast on 3 days per week. Tumbuka programmes started in November—the first regular broadcasts to be made in this language in Central Africa.

Vernacular programmes included daily news bulletins, features, magazine programmes, plays, daily religious programmes, book reviews, request programmes, variety shows, tribal and town music and programmes for particular communities such as farmers. It was not possible to carry out detailed listener research but judging from the hundreds of letters received each month response to the regional station was very good.

Programmes were also received in the Protectorate from the Federal Broadcasting Corporation's stations in Lusaka and Salisbury. The Lusaka programme included 15 hours of Nyanja per week and an early morning request programme.
in English, both of which continued to attract African listeners in Nyasaland.

The General Service programmes from Salisbury served the English speaking community, who were also able to receive the B.B.C. Overseas Service, and South African and Portuguese East African stations.

Indian stations were received at good strength so that the local Asian community were well served in their own languages. Reception of most of these stations was reasonable outside the ionospheric season.

It is estimated that there are over 22,000 inexpensive transistorized dry-battery sets in the Protectorate.

With the establishment of its own regional station, and the introduction of transistorized receivers within the means of the African population, broadcasting in Nyasaland had made encouraging progress by the end of 1960.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and tea industries, retail trading.

On 31st December 1960 there were nine employees' trade unions with a paid-up membership of 7,964 and six associations of employers.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are maize, millet, cassava, groundnuts, tea, tobacco, rice, cotton, tung-oil and miscellaneous pulses.

Timber production in 1960 (excluding private land) was 2,346,368 cubic feet, of which hardwood amounted to 2,090,249 cubic feet and softwood 256,126 cubic feet. Included in the total production was 185,355 cubic feet of poles and 1,823,683 cubic feet of firewood.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa and commercial enterprises are in process of development; fishery research is being undertaken.

No minerals were exported on a commercial scale during 1960, although samples of various minerals were sent out of the country for analysis.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of soap, cigarettes and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

* Including Government imports, but not bullion and specie.

No records are available of inter-territorial trade within the Federation and the above statistics of imports and exports refer to trade with countries outside the Federation.

The chief imports are metals, metal manufactures, machinery and vehicles; fibres, yarns, textiles and apparel; foodstuffs; oils, resins, waxes, paint and varnishes.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of the principal cash crops grown on African trust land, namely, tobacco, cotton, maize and groundnuts, is handled by a statutory board whose aim is to ensure a steady price to the producer, as near as possible to world prices, and to secure improvement of the quality of the product. The board helps to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of contributions from surpluses to the African Development and Welfare Fund. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1960 there were 80 primary and 7 secondary co-operative societies, with 7,058 members and 67 member societies respectively. The main products handled are rice, coffee and ghee.

Principal Exports by Quantity and Value to Countries other than Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia (see note under "Trade").
