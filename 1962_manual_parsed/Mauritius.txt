MAURITIUS

Area

The area of Mauritius is approximately 720 square miles, that of Rodrigues 40 square miles and the area of the Lesser Dependencies, viz., the Chagos Archipelago (the largest islet is Diego Garcia), Agalega and the Cargados Carajos or St. Brandon Isles, approximately 47½ square miles.

Population

The estimated population at 31st December 1960 was: Mauritius 648,838, Rodrigues 17,662, Lesser Dependencies 1,950; divided approximately into: (1) general population, comprising Europeans and descendants of Europeans and people of African and mixed origin, 29%; (2) Indo-Mauritians, made up of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent and their descendants, 68%; and Chinese, consisting of immigrants from China and their descendants, 3%.

Principal Towns

At the 31st December 1960 the estimated population of the principal towns was:

- Port Louis (capital) . . . . . . 89,900
- Curepipe (new limits) . . . . . 37,000
- Beau Bassin-Rose Hill . . . . . 36,400
- Quatre Bornes . . . . . . . . . 22,400

Geographical Features

The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them are navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. Some of the larger waterfalls have been harnessed to supply hydro-electric power.
power. The land rises gradually from the coasts and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Remnants of the native forests of the island cover some 15,000 acres.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The mean temperature varies from 74°F. at sea level to 67°F. at 2,000 feet. The highest and lowest values ever recorded at Pamplemousses at 180 feet are 95°F. and 50°F., and at Vacoas, at 1,394 feet on the western slopes, are 98°F. and 46°F.

Rainfall differs considerably according to the height above sea level. On the highest part of the central plateau an average of 200 inches falls each year but amounts decrease rapidly to 60 and 35 inches on the windward and leeward coasts. There is no marked dry season but in the three months from September to November rainfall is about one quarter of the fall in the three wettest months, January to March.

Tropical cyclones may occur between September and May but by far the greatest frequency and intensity is in January and February; March and April also being important months owing to the greater susceptibility to damage of the grown sugar cane. In about 10% of all years, mean wind speed over an hour reaches 50 m.p.h. and gusts 100 m.p.h.; gusts of 80 m.p.h. may be expected about 25 times every century.

History

Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. Settlements were established from 1638 onwards but did not prosper and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French. A small first contingent of colonists was sent in 1721 from the neighbouring island of Réunion (then called Bourbon), but it was not actually occupied until 1722 when a small party of colonists was sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Constitution

The Government is vested in a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Mauritius (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, provides for a Legislative Council consisting of the Speaker (appointed by the Governor from outside the Council) three ex officio members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), 40 elected members and such nominated members not exceeding 12 in number as the Governor may appoint.

The Colony is divided into 40 single-member constituencies and every person (male or female) has the right to vote who:

(a) is a British subject of the age of 21 years or upwards; and

(b) has resided in the Colony for a period of at least two years immediately before the date of registration or is domiciled in the Colony and is residing therein at that date; and

(c) has resided in the constituency in which he is entitled to be registered as a voter for a period of at least six months immediately before the date of registration.

The Executive Council consists of the three ex officio members above mentioned and ten appointed members. The appointed members are persons who are elected or nominated members of the Legislative Council and are appointed by the Governor acting in his discretion. The ex officio members and the appointed members are all styled Ministers. Ministers are responsible to the Governor in Executive Council, and to the Legislative Council, for all matters affecting the departments with which they are associated.

The Ministerial system was established in July 1957, in anticipation of the new constitution provided by the Mauritius (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958.

Land Policy

Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unconceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) “Pas Geométriques” being reserved land lying on the sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81·21 metres. Alienable Crown lands may be sold only by public auction, except in the case of lands required for religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for public utility, when a nominal price is charged. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands and “Pas Geométriques” may be leased by private contract or public auction.

The remaining five-sixths of the area of the island are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.
Taxation

Income tax rates for individuals are:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax cents |
|-------------------|------------------|
| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10 |

| Rs. 5,000 | 20 |
| Rs. 5,000 | 30 |
| Rs. 5,000 | 40 |
| Rs. 10,000 | 50 |
| Rs. 15,000 | 60 |
| For every rupee of the remainder of the chargeable income | 70 |

In ascertaining the chargeable income a number of deductions are allowed.

Company tax is at the rate of 40%.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

The fixed rate of exchange is 1s. 6d. to the rupee.

Development Plans

In view of the cyclones which ravaged the island in early 1960, the previous Development Programme for the period 1957–62 has been wound up and replaced with effect from the 1st July 1960 by a five-year Reconstruction and Development Programme estimated to cost Rs.354 million.

The main sources of finance envisaged for the new Programme are:

| Rs.m |
|------|
| Local resources | 148 |
| Colonial Development and Welfare funds | 24 |
| Loans and Grants from Colonial Services Vote | 29 |
| Loans and Grants from H.M.G. for low cost housing programme | 49 |
| Potential assistance from H.M.G. | 29 |
| Potential assistance from external sources | 50 |
| Total | 329 |

leaving a gap of Rs.25m only. The amount of Rs.24m from Colonial Development and Welfare funds includes the territorial allocation of Rs.10m under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, and a balance of Rs.6m from the territorial allocation under the 1955 Act.

The programmed expenditure can be broken down into five main sectors:

| Rs.m |
|------|
| Administration | 17·5 |
| Economic Services | 51·8 |
| Infra-Structure | 139·8 |
| Social Services | 129·6 |
| Other Expenditure | 15·3 |
| Total | 354·0 |

Education

On 31st October 1960 there were 606 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 529 were primary schools, 72 secondary, two post-secondary and two Central Schools, one Technical Institute and Trade centre, with a total of 147,619 pupils. The Government institutions comprised 119 primary schools, two central schools, three secondary schools, one training college for teachers, one post-secondary College of Agriculture and one Technical Institute. Eight secondary and 76 primary schools within the total given above were State-aided. There were also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The Government awarded six scholarships in 1960 for higher education overseas. Mauritian students overseas, mainly in United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities, numbered 610.

Adult education courses provide for post-primary and post-secondary education in Science, Handwork, Art, Typewriting, Book-keeping, Secretarial Training, "Builders Quantities", Economics, Local Government, Telecommunications Mathematics, Telecommunications Practice, Technical Drawing, English Language and Electrical Engineering courses for apprentices.
In the financial year 1960–61, expenditure on education was Rs.19,658,525·18 (excluding capital expenditure on new buildings and other development works which cost Rs.3,341,365·41). In 1935 expenditure was Rs.1,347,201.

Libraries and Museums

There are seven Libraries:—(i) Police Library, Port Louis, (ii) Municipality of Port Louis Library, (iii) Town Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill Library, (iv) Carnegie Library, Curepipe, (v) Mauritius Institute Library, Port Louis, (vi) British Council Library, Rose Hill, (vii) Urban Council of Quatre Bornes Library.

The Natural History Museum, Port Louis, and the Historical Museum, Mahebourg, are both run by the Mauritius Institute. A small art gallery is also annexed to the Port Louis Museum.

Health

Two violent cyclones visited Mauritius during the year. The effects of the second cyclone, the worst to hit the island since 1892, were severe. 42 persons were killed, 90 severely injured and 1,677 were taken to hospitals for treatment. About 80,000 refugees thronged the refugee centres. With the help of other departments and local voluntary organisations, the Health Department set up emergency health and sanitary arrangements in refugee centres and in hospitals and an extra scavenging service was provided throughout the island. An extensive anti-typhoid inoculation campaign was also undertaken. 251,028 persons received one injection of T.A.B. vaccine and 163,258 presented themselves for the second injection.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 13 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1960 was 1,191 in general hospitals, 747 at the Mental Hospital, 202 at the Orthopaedic Centre, 61 at the Leper Asylum and 46 in the Prison hospitals. In addition, 27 sugar estates provide each a small hospital with a total of 593 beds for the sole benefit of their employees. There were also five private nursing homes, 50 static dispensaries (excluding two prisons’ dispensaries), four mobile dispensaries and four mobile dental clinics. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provides 23 static centres and one mobile antenatal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 34,355; attendances at static dispensaries numbered 1,000,654 and at mobile dispensaries 85,101.

The expenditure on medical services during the financial year 1960–61 amounted to Rs.15,599,461·60 against an actual expenditure of Rs.1,964,369 in 1929–30.

Communications

The airport (Plaisance) is run by the Colonial Government and the meteorological services are under the control of the Director, Meteorology. Air France operates a scheduled “Super Constellation” service three times a week between Paris and Mauritius through Cairo, Nairobi, Madagascar and Réunion. Qantas Empire Airways operate a scheduled “Super Constellation” service between Sydney and Johannesburg via Melbourne, Darwin, Coços Islands and Mauritius one weekly in each direction. South African Airways have a fortnightly scheduled Douglas DC7B service between Johannesburg and Perth via Mauritius and Coços Islands; the return flight from Australia to South Africa is along the same route. British Overseas Airways Corporation inaugurated in January 1962 a weekly Britannia service between London and Mauritius via Rome, Khartoum and Nairobi. No internal services exist.

The railway carried 536,601 metric tons of freight in 1959–60. Track mileage totalled 82.

There are in the Colony about 512 miles of main roads, 232 miles of branch roads and 63 miles of streets in villages and extra-urban areas; 483 miles of main and branch roads have been asphalted.

Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate ten ocean-going vessels at any one time and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the British and Commonwealth Shipping Company and from continental ports by the French companies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie. Havraise Peninsulaire; the Scindia Steamships Company provide a regular monthly cargo service from Bombay and the O.S.K. Line provide a regular monthly cargo service from Japan and the Far East. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Interocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East–South Africa–South America service, providing a regular passenger and cargo service to and from South Africa. During 1960, 415 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total of 1,300,618 net tons.

Broadcasting

Government runs the Mauritius Broadcasting Service, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station at Forest Side operates on 438 metres, 683 kc/s medium wave and 49·17 and 90·23 metres, 6,101 and 3,325 kc/s short-wave with powers of 10 kW in both cases. In June 1961 there were 42,049 wireless licences in force in the Colony, with an estimate of five listeners per receiver.

Principal Occupations

Cane plantation and sugar manufacture give employment to approximately 4,100 skilled and 52,600 unskilled workers. Other industries are tea planting and manufacture, employing some 2,100 workers; tobacco 2,300; aloe fibre 1,100. The docks and stevedoring companies give employment to about 3,100; Government and private services 12,100.

In 1960 there were 72 registered trade unions including nine associations of employers and two federations of trade unions with 34 members. Total membership of the employees’ unions was 25,431.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar-cane, “aloe” (Furcraea) fibre, tea and tobacco. Sugar is produced in 23 factories the modernization of which is nearly completed. Practically all the “aloe” fibre produced is utilized locally for the manufacture of sugar bags. The Colony grows some of its subsidiary foodstuffs and vegetables and produces a proportion of its vegetable oil requirements. Coconut oil is extracted at a factory in Port Louis from copra obtained from the dependencies known as the Oil Islands. The only
by-product of sugar cane is alcohol, of which 19,000 hectolitres of 100° G.L. were produced in 1960.

The Livestock population is estimated to be roughly: 'creole' milch breed cattle, 38,000; Zebu type, beef herd cattle, 2,500; goats, 53,000; pigs, 4,000; sheep, 500; rabbits, 4,000; poultry and other birds, 350,000.

The catch of fish in territorial waters is approximately 1,500 tons a year.
