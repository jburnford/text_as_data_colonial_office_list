SWAZILAND

Area
Swaziland Protectorate, the smallest of the three High Commission territories is bordered on the north, west and south by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Mozambique and on the south-east by Natal. It lies between latitudes 24° 50' and 26° 40' south and longitudes 30° 25' and 32° 5' east. With a total area of 6,704 square miles, it is a country of many diversities and many distinctive characteristics.

Population
The 1956 Census showed that the population of Swaziland was 240,511. This figure included 11,728 Swazi who were temporarily employed outside the Territory and 3,470 foreign Africans temporarily employed in Swaziland. Africans comprised 97% of the population, Europeans 2.4% and Euraficans 0.6%. At the end of 1960 the population was estimated at 273,000 including approximately 10,500 Swazi temporarily absent. This figure is broken down as follows; 261,500 Swazis, 9,700 Europeans, 1,800 Euraficans.

Principal Towns
The capital is Mbabane and other principal towns are: Hlatikulu, Mankaiana, Manzine, Piggs Peak and Stegi.

Geographical Features
Geographically and climatically, it is divisible into four physiographic provinces—the broken mountainous high-veld in the west, with altitudes averaging over 4,000 feet, the middle-veld which is mostly mixed farming country about 2,000 feet lower and the low-veld, a hot woodland region typified by aloes, acacias and pterocarpus, and bounded on the east by the Lubombo mountains, with an average altitude of 1,500 feet. The Lubombo mountains form the fourth physiographic province. Four rivers, the Komati, Usutu, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma, flow from west to east, cutting their way through the Lubombo mountains to the Indian Ocean. The exploitation of these rivers is particularly important to the agricultural development of the middle and bush veld, where irrigation projects are giving the scenery a different aspect.

Climate
75% to 80% of the rains come in the summer half of the year from October to March. Year to year variability of totals is extremely large, especially in the low-veld. Drought hazard is also most serious in the low-veld. The average rainfall at Mbabane in the high-veld is 54.6 inches, at Manzini (formerly Bremersdorp) in the middle-veld 35.9 inches and at Sipofaneni in the low-veld 26.5 inches. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively 72.6°F. and 51.7°F. at Mbabane; 79.7°F. and 56.4°F. at Manzini; and 84.4°F. and 59.5°F. at Sipofaneni.

History
Swaziland remained nominally independent until 1890. From 1890 to 1894 the United Kingdom and the Transvaal (South African Republic) Governments established a species of condominium which was replaced in 1894 by an arrangement under which the South African Republic was given powers of protection and administration without actual incorporation. After the Anglo-Boer war, the administration of Swaziland was transferred to the Governor of the Transvaal, who was also the High Commissioner of South Africa, but in 1907 responsibility for Swaziland was transferred from the Governor to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Swaziland therefore remained under the control of the United Kingdom when the Transvaal became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

Constitution
In 1902, at the end of the Anglo-Boer war, the British Special Commissioner with a small force of the South African Constabulary was sent into Swaziland to establish a provisional Administration. Shortly afterwards, an Order in Council dated the 25th of June 1903, was issued which established the relationship between Great Britain and the Swazi and constitutes the basic authority under which the Administration has been conducted by Her Majesty's Government.

At the head of Government is the Resident Commissioner, who is subject to the direction and instructions of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland. The Resident Commissioner exercises such administration and control and is vested with all such powers, authorities and jurisdiction as are conferred upon him by the Swaziland Administration Proclamation of 1904 and other laws, or by the terms of his Commission. He is assisted and advised by the Government Secretary, who is also the Deputy Resident Commissioner, and by the heads of the various Government departments. The Territory is divided into six districts which are administered by District Commissioners stationed at Mbabane, Manzini, Hlatikulu, Piggs Peak, Mankaiana and Stegi. The District Commissioners are the principal executive officers of Government within their districts and directly responsible to the Resident Commissioner for their efficient administration. The Judiciary falls under the Chief Justice of the High Commission Territories.

The Resident Commissioner is advised by the European Advisory Council on matters directly affecting the European residents of Swaziland and on any other matters specifically referred to the Council by the Resident Commissioner. The Territory is divided into ten electoral divisions and each returns one member to the Council, which usually meets twice a year. Urgent matters are, however, dealt with by the Council's Standing Committee. On matters concerning the African population the Resident Commissioner consults the Paramount Chief and through him the Swazi National Council.
The Constitutional Committee set up in 1960 has completed its work and presented its report to the Secretary of State.

A great deal of the structure of the traditional Swazi political system has been retained in the modern pattern of the Swazi National Administration. The Ngwenyama (the Paramount Chief) is the constitutional ruler who is advised by his kinsmen and his chosen Councillors and cannot initiate action without the approval of two formally constituted Councils. The Liqoqo, comprising the more important of Ngwenyama's kinsmen and a number of chosen advisers, and the Libandla, which at its widest extension is a Council of every adult male in the nation. It is recognised as the final body from which approval for any contemplated act or legislation should be obtained.

From the central institutions of the Swazi National Administration, responsibility for the routine administration of the country devolves upon the Chiefs and Indunas.

There are proclaimed townships at Mbabane, Manzini, Stegi, Hlatikulu and Goedgegun. In each of these townships and in Piggs Peak village, an Urban Area Advisory Committee functions under the chairmanship of the District Commissioner and advises him on the administration and welfare of the township and surrounding urban area. These Committees consist of five elected members and Government officials nominated by the Resident Commissioner. There are, in addition, African Advisory Committees which advise the District Commissioner on the needs of the urban African population. Attention is now being given to the question of granting municipal status to the townships of Mbabane and Manzini. Whilst no formal machinery has been established to effect joint consultation between the different communities in the Territory, Standing Committees of the Swazi Nation and the European Advisory Council, as well as representatives of the Eurafrican Welfare Association, meet together to discuss matters of territorial importance. In terms of the Swaziland Administration Proclamation, 107, Roman Dutch Common Law is the common law of the Territory, except where modified by statute. In civil matters Swazi law and custom may be followed where necessary. Statute law consists of Transvaal laws in force at the date of the Administration Proclamation and all subsequent laws promulgated by the High Commissioner. A Special Court, now the High Court, having the full jurisdiction of a Superior Court, was also established together with Courts of District Commissioners with a limited jurisdiction. A Court of Appeal for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland was established in 1955, but the right of further appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was retained.

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are African tax, European poll tax and income tax, towards which mining companies contribute the major share. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Swaziland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades. There are also death duties.

### Public Finance

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 1957–58 | 1,684,507  | 1,327,258       |
| 1959–60 | 1,453,389  | 1,629,715       |
| 1960–61 | 1,493,124  | 1,803,737       |
| 1961–62 | 1,667,628  | 2,077,628       |

Excluding expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1961–62:

- Customs and Excise: £540,000
- Income tax: £1,562,000
- Posts and telegraphs: £315,000

As revenue was expected to fall below expenditure in 1961–62 and the central balance would be exhausted, the United Kingdom Government approved a grant-in-aid of £390,000.

### Currency

The currency in circulation in Swaziland is that of the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).

### Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, Swaziland received an allocation of a little over £4m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959–64. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:

- Roads: £920,000
- Education: £673,000
- Water supplies: £500,000
- Agriculture: £320,000

A further allocation of £280,000 was made in 1961 for development to March 1963. This will be used principally towards Education, Hospital extensions and Electricity supplies.

The construction of the first railway in Swaziland has recently been approved and the line should be open for traffic during 1964. The railway will run a distance of 140 miles to the Mozambique border and will eventually link Swaziland with the port of Lourenço Marques. Its construction will make possible the development of large iron ore deposits at Ngwenya and will facilitate the export of wood pulp and sugar.

### Education

African Primary Education is largely the responsibility of a number of Church Missions which receive substantial financial assistance from the Government in the form of salary and equipment grants. Apart from 236 schools falling under the direct superintendence of the Missions there are 19 Government maintained schools, three National schools financed by the Swazi Treasury and 36 tribal schools. Enrolment which stood at 13,797 in 1950 reached 37,339 Swazis in 1961. In addition to the primary schools there are three high schools, 20 junior secondary schools,
two Teacher Training Centres, a Housecraft Training Centre and a Trades School which offers courses in building, carpentry and motor mechanics.

Many bursaries are granted each year to assist students taking secondary school courses leading to matriculation, teacher training courses, post-matriculation courses at University level and various forms of industrial training.

For European children, education is compulsory up to the age of sixteen or the successful completion of Standard VIII. There are two high schools and 11 primary schools with a total enrolment of 1,540 in 1961.

The Coloured, or Eurafrican, community is numerically the smallest group in Swaziland and comprises a wide range of types with varying material and cultural standards. The educational requirements of coloured children are met by five Government-aided Mission boarding-schools, one of which offers secondary education up to matriculation and two to the Junior Certificate. There is also a Housecraft Training Centre for girls, while coloured boys may and do enrol at the Mbabane Trades School. Total enrolment in 1961 was 682.

Health

The medical staff of the Administration consists of the Director of Medical Services, nine Medical Officers, three Health Inspectors, two Dispenser-Storekeepers, one Laboratory technician, two Matrons and 12 Nursing Sisters. Seven doctors and 13 mission nursing sisters are subsidised by the Government.

There are two Government general hospitals, one at Mbabane and the other at Hlatikulu. In the former there is accommodation for 151 patients and 135 in the latter. There is a 24-bed cottage hospital at Mankaiana and another with 16 beds at Piggs Peak. The Raleigh Fitkin Memorial (Mission) Hospital at Manzini provides accommodation for 200 patients, the Roman Catholic Mission Hospital at Stegi for 35 patients and the Mahamba Methodist Hospital for 73 patients.

There are 11 Government, 16 Mission and three other Clinics financed by the Swazi National Treasury, throughout the Territory. A Health Office containing a well equipped Public Health Laboratory is at Manzini.

Communications

The road motor-transport services of the South African Railways Administration and the Portuguese East African Administration carry both goods and passengers and operate between Swaziland and the railheads in the neighbouring territories. A railway line to the Mozambique border is under construction.

The Territory is served by a network of roads which are being rapidly brought to acceptable standards. There is an extensive telecommunications system.

Main Crops and Products

Cattle form the main wealth of the Swazis and the total number owned increased from 146,542 in 1921 to 434,995 in 1949; in 1960 the number was 401,973. The number of cattle owned by others increased from 63,748 in 1921 to 119,481 in 1960. In 1960 there were 204,214 goats, 35,482 sheep and 12,696 pigs.

Slaughter cattle are exported to markets in Johannesburg and Durban which are controlled by export quotas allocated by the South African Meat Industry Control Board. The numbers of cattle exported increased by 27% in 1960 compared with those of 1959. Sales of butter during 1960 amounted to close on 158,000 lbs., an increase of 22% on the 1959 figures.

Mining is an important part of Swaziland's economy. The Havelock asbestos mine in the north-western corner of the Territory is one of the largest asbestos mines in the world and is apparently assured of a life of at least 30 years at present rates of output. Rich deposits of iron ore exist north-west of Mbabane and will be developed as a result of the decision to build a railway link to Mozambique. There is a small tin-mining industry and barytes is being worked in the Mbabane district. There are very extensive anthracite coal deposits in the low-veld. High-grade calcite exists in the Hlatikulu District and a rich iron-ore deposit in the Piggs Peak area. Corundum and beryl have also been found.

The agricultural possibilities of Swaziland are considerable and most crops can be grown. In the past seven years, there has been an immense improvement in agricultural methods among the Swazi due to the stimulus of the rural development schemes which were inaugurated in 1949.

The most important dry-land crop is maize, but only a proportion of the Territory's home consumption is grown in Swaziland. The most important dry-land cash crops during 1960 were cotton, which was valued at R.434,595, tobacco, production of which amounted to 959,297 lbs. of leaf (resulting in a total first payment to growers of R.98,436) and pineapples. Some 1,550 tons of canned pineapples (valued at R.252,000) were exported to the United Kingdom during the year. Both the cotton and the tobacco were record crops. All the cotton grown in Swaziland is exported to the gineries in the Republic of South Africa, while the tobacco is sold to a Tobacco Co-operative at Goedgegun.

In 1957 the Colonial Development Corporation completed the construction of a gravity canal which is able to command up to 35,000 acres, 8,200 acres of which have already been planted out to sugar. This project on the Komati, together with a similar one on the Usutu River, each have a new sugar mill with annual quotas for the production of a total of 80,000 tons of sugar. There are several other minor irrigation schemes throughout the middle and low veld of the Territory.

By December 1960 there were over 300,000 citrus trees in orchards in the Territory. The figure to 1959 was 193,886.

Considerable developments have taken place in forestry in the last two decades. The total area set aside for afforestation is upwards of 200,000 acres and by the end of 1960 190,000 acres had already been afforested. There are three main projects with a total of 171,963 acres including 3,000 acres of the Swazi National forests which is managed by Usutu Forests Limited. The largest of the three projects, Usutu Forests with 97,500 acres of plantation, reached the production stage in 1961. The Usutu Pulp Company with a Share capital of R.10,000,000 was formed in 1959 to produce and export unbleached pulp. The pulp will be exported to United Kingdom markets via Lourenço Marques.
