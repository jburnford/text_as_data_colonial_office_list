THE FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALAND

History and Constitution
A short account of the events leading up to the establishment of the Federation in September 1953, and a summary of the Federal Constitution, are to be found in the 1954 and 1955 editions of the Colonial Office List.

Responsibilities of Her Majesty's Government
From the 19th March 1962 responsibility for the affairs of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland was transferred from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Home Secretary. The Home Secretary at the same time assumed responsibility for all matters concerning Southern Rhodesia and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, hitherto discharged by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.

A new Department, the Central African Office, responsible to the Home Secretary, was set up to deal with all matters pertaining to these territories.
