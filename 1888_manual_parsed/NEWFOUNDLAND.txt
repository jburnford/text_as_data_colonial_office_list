NEWFOUNDLAND.

(See map, page 55).

Situation and Area.

This island is situated between 48° 87' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles. The coast of Labrador, on the continent, is now included in the colony. It comprises about 120,000 square miles, but has only 4,211 inhabitants.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries, Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634, a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and 20 years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclu
The sovereignty of Newfoundland was ceded to Great Britain, subject to certain rights reserved to France, which are still in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo. They claim the exclusive right to fish along certain portions of the coast from Bona Vista to Cape Riche, upon which they erect temporary structures for drying the fish. The exact extent of this right is in dispute, and there are other questions at issue as to magisterial jurisdiction, mines, harbours, and river fisheries. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland, mainly on account of the provisions for the sale of bait.

**Industries.**

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, and mining—are mainly confined to the sea coast.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, salmon, herring, and lobster. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in June, and the fishery extends for over 700 miles, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. In 1874 the number of men engaged was 58,000, including the subsidiary industries, with 1,200 vessels of about 62,000 tons, besides 18,000 boats employed in the shore fisheries. The home consumption is about 270,000 quintals, and the export in 1885 was 1,084,710 quintals, 80 bank cod going, on an average, to one quintal.

**Currency and Banking.**

There are two banks in the Colony, the Union Bank of Newfoundland (capital £114,000, note circulation £147,889), and the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland (capital £76,500, note circulation £80,418); their aggregate deposits in 1886 amounted to £876,248. There is a Government savings bank at St. John's and Harbour Grace, with £1,749,618 deposits, and 8,985 depositors.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States gold and full weight dollars, gold doubloons, Mexican and other dollars, and Colonial coins. Much of the trade is carried on by barter. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents.

**Means of Communication.**

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, constructed and worked by a private company. The total approximate cost of construction was £2,500,000, the receipts in 1886 being £6,772, and the expenses £6,974. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 994½ miles of telegraph open, and cables start for Europe (at Heart's Content) and America (at Placentia). There is a fortnightly mail service (except from January to March) with Liverpool, Halifax, New York, Montreal, and Prince Edward Island. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers per ¼ oz. | Free |

| In St. John's                 | 1 cent. |
| Within Colony                 | 8 "   |
| Europe, United States, and    | 5 "   |
| St. Pierre, Miquelon          | 1 cent. |
| South America and West Indies | 8 "   |

**Education.**

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1887. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of elected boards. There are 480 schools, with 25,897 scholars. The schools are denominational (except Harbour Grace Grammar School), and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, but there is no provision for technical education. The total cost of primary education in 1886 was £111,470.

**Chief Towns.**

The capital is St. John's, with 28,610 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 7,054; Fogo, with Twillingate, has 4,777; Bona Vista 3,468; and Carbonear 3,766 inhabitants.

**Constitution.**

Newfoundland was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council not to exceed 7 members, a Legislative Council not to exceed 15 members, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by householders, who have occupied a dwelling-house as owner or tenant for 1 year immediately preceding the day of election. There are 28,350 (exclusive of Burgisada Poile) electors registered on the electoral roll, and 19 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members; 8 return two members, and 9 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding £500, in amount or value, or a net annual income of £100. The ordinary duration of the Session is about three months, and it generally meets in January.

Members of the Council and Assembly receive £120 each (President £240), per session, which is provided for annually in a local Act. There are no municipal institutions in the Colony.

NEW SOUTH WALES.*

Situation and Area.

This Colony is situated on the eastern coast of
the Australian continent, from Point Danger, and
the 29th parallel, to Cape Howe, the boundary
of Victoria. It is bounded on the west by the
141st meridian of east longitude.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' S.
lat., and 151° 12' E. long. Population, including
the suburbs, according to census of 1881, 224,211;
estimated population at end of 1886, 332,709.

The Colony contains 306,066 square miles
(195,882,150 acres), of which 977,664 acres are
under crop.

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have
been discovered by Spanish navigators in 1609, but
no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored
it in 1770, but the first settlement was not formed
until 1788, when the convict station at Botany Bay
was established.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then
held to include the whole western shore of the
continent. The discovery of gold led to a very
rapid growth of what is now Victoria, which was
made a separate colony in 1851. Moreton Bay,
to the north, was constituted a separate colony in
1859, under the name of Queensland.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide
range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the
mean is 48°-5, to Grafton, 69°-0. On the coast
it varies from 59°-7, at Eden, to 69°-0, at Grafton,
Sydney being 61°-7, almost the same as Madrid
(61°-4). On the mountains snow lies in some
places all the winter. On the high table land
at Bathurst the mean temperature is 56°-8, and on
the inland plains about 70°-0.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the
coast increases; at Deniliquin it is 13 inches; at
Sydney, 49 inches; and the days on which rain
falls, 141. At London the number of days is 146,
and the amount 24 inches; only 25 per cent of this
falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a
day, while in Sydney 60 per cent may be said to fall in
torrents of from half an inch to 8 inches per day.

The prevalent winds in summer are the north-
east sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry,
cold westerly; and wet S. and S.E.

* Norfolk Island, formerly a receptacle for English con-
victs, and Pitcairn Island, famous on account of the story
of the mutiny of the "Bounty," are under the superinten-
dency of the Governor of New South Wales. The inhabitants
of Pitcairn Island were removed to Norfolk Island in 1857,
but some of them have since returned.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common
in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales
is wool.

In 1876 100,786,830 lbs. of wool, the produce of
the colony, value 5,565,173l., were exported; in
1877 102,150,246 lbs., value 5,256,088l.;
in 1878, 111,888,017 lbs., value 5,728,316l.;
in 1879, 128,710,450 lbs., value 6,491,198l.;
in 1880, 154,871,832 lbs., value 8,040,625l.;

in 1883, 188,161,710 lbs., value 9,598,781l.;
in 1884, 173,986,608 lbs., value 8,953,100l.;
in 1885, 168,151,659 lbs., value 7,246,642l.;
in 1886, 178,985,640 lbs., value 7,028,598l.;
in addition to which, wool to the value of 178,380l.,
the produce of other colonies, was exported during
1886. The Colony also produces coal, silver, tin,
iron, copper, gold, antimony, silver, lead ore, bis-
muth, and sundry other minerals, tobacco, sugar,
and kerosene.

The live stock on 31 March, 1887, was as
follows:—361,668 horses—cattle, 1,367,844—sheep,
39,169,304—pigs, 209,576. Gold and coin produce
of the Colony exported in 1880 was valued at
830,776l.; in 1881, 1,915,028l.; 1882, 1,697,791l.; 1883,
1,689,517l.; 1884, 934,406l.; 1885, 1,451,124l.; 1886,
1,619,986l.

The coal mines have steadily advanced since
1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is
given as 438,889 tons, valued at 236,290l., while
in 1881, 1,775,224 tons, valued at 603,248l., were
raised from 40 mines; and in 1886 2,830,175 tons,
valued at 1,509,164l., raised from 54 mines.

The export of coal in 1885 was 1,756,365 tons,
valued at 966,668l.; and in 1886 1,735,865 tons,
valued at 947,002l.; principally to the other Aus-
tralian colonies and the United States.

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry, and
had in 1887 1,135 vessels, of a total tonnage of
129,908.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At
Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at
which much gold is coined.

The following banks have branches in the
Colony:—

Bank of New South Wales, Commercial Bank,
Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia,
Australian Joint Stock Bank, London Chartered
Bank of Australia, English, Scottish and Australian
Chartered Bank, City Bank, Federal Bank of
Australia, Queensland National Bank, Bank of
New Zealand, Commercial Bank of Australia, Mer-
cantile Bank, National Bank of Australasia.

Interest is allowed at the rate of 6l. per cent. per annum on deposits up to 100l.

The Government Savings Banks, established in 1871, had, on 31st December, 1886, 1,428,305l. deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on deposits from 1l. up to 200l.

Means of Communication.

There are more than 23,522 miles of common roads, 5,000 of which are metalled. In addition to 50 miles of bridges, there are 87 public ferries, 4 being worked by steam. There are 1,890 miles of railways, all owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been 24,079,555l. The receipts during 1886 were 2,160,070l., and the working expenses 1,492,992l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being 667,078l. There are also 364 miles of Government tramways, earning in 1886 234,143l. Of telegraphs there are 10,617 miles open, with 425 stations. The cost of construction was 666,528l., and the receipts during 1886 184,053l. Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, and the Hunter, while Port Jackson and Port Stephens are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the fortnightly vessels of the P. and O. and Orient lines, and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles) Union Company (via San Francisco) and North German Lloyd (via Genoa). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

The rates of postage are:

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. In 1886 there were 2,170 State schools in operation, namely, 8 high schools, 4 for boys and 4 girls, 26 superior public schools, 1,587 ordinary public schools, 328 provincial schools, 169 half-time schools, 58 house-to-house schools under itinerant teachers, and 20 evening public schools. The Colony has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is provided for. It may be imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective churches. For the year 1886, the Parliamentary grant for public instruction was about 717,576l. or 14s. 4d. per head of population. In 1886, 186,126 children attended the ordinary State schools, and nearly 1,200 were inmates of the orphan schools, industrial schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the blind. In 1886, private schools, including church schools, showed an attendance of 38,766 children.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1851. Its State endowment was originally 5,000l., but is now 12,000l. per annum—5,000l. additional having been voted in 1882, and 2,000l. more in 1883. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The Parliamentary grant for 1886 amounts to nearly 17,500l., and 22,862l. was expended by Government on buildings. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of 500l. per annum. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, and science. Recently several faculties have been added to its curriculum. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, attended by 429 pupils, and having a State endowment of 1,500l., and a total vote for 1886—for endowment, buildings, and salaries—of 2,800l. There is also a technical college for working men, and in the country towns there are about 150 mechanics' schools of arts. Parliament has voted for 1886 over 17,000l. towards the support of schools of arts; and for technical instruction—in the college and in connection with the schools of arts and the evening public schools—a grant of 17,000l. is available. A Board of Technical Education, consisting of 24 members, with Mr. Edward Combes, C.M.G., M.P., as President, has been constituted for the purpose of establishing a State system of technical education in the colony. There are also a Royal Society, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, and an Art Society, with many other educational associations of a like character. For the Sydney Free Library a grant of 7,910l. has been voted for 1886; for the Museum and the Technical Museum, 11,100l.; and for the Fine Art Gallery, 9,250l.

The total State grant available for 1886 for educational purposes—as enumerated in the foregoing statement—was about 754,579l.

Defence.

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, George and Bradley's Heads, and other prominent positions in the harbour, and also along the coast.

The Military Forces consist of:—(a), 376 Regular Artillery; (b), partially paid Volunteers: Artillery (511), Engineers (100), Torpedo Corps (160), and Infantry (2,044); (c), Volunteer Reserves: Cavalry (543), Artillery (120), and Infantry (2,468).

The Naval Forces are a Naval Brigade, numbering 328, partially paid, and 300 Naval Artillery Volunteers, purely voluntary. Including the general Staff of 27 officers and the Medical Staff, there is a total force of 6,987 of all ranks.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 12 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 54 municipal boroughs and 65 municipal districts, controlling property of the annual value of 5,928,524l., and having a revenue in 1886 of 406,756l., exclusive of loans, an expenditure of 493,079l., and an outstanding debt of 440,149l.

Constitution.

In New South Wales, "responsible Government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54. The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which
consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council now consists of 60 members.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict. No. 13), consists of 124 members, representing 72 electoral districts; and provision is made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extends to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise is given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in District.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l. respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district: Provided that no elector possessing more than one qualification within the same electoral district shall be thereby entitled to an additional vote for that district: Provided also when any premises are jointly owned or occupied or held on lease by more persons than one, each of such joint owners, occupiers, or leaseholders shall be entitled to vote in respect of such premises in case the value of his individual interest therein separately taken would, under the provisions of the said section, entitle him to vote if solely interested." (Section II.)

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Act of 1858 now repealed.
