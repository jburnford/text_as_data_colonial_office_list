BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.

The Bahamas are a chain of islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N. lat., and 79° 5' W. long., composed of about 20 inhabited islands, and an immense number of islets and rocks, comprising altogether 4,466 square miles. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Mayaguana, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, and the Biminis, all of which are ports of entry; and Great Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Cat Island, Watling's Island, once known as St. Salvador, the Berry Islands, and Andros Island (containing the only river).

History.

St. Salvador, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines, and the islands were abandoned. Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally annexed them to England in 1578, and in 1612 they were nominally attached to Virginia. The island of New Providence was granted by Charles II to a proprietary body in 1670, and in 1671 Captain Johnson Wentworth was appointed by the proprietors to be their first Governor. It fell into the hands of the French and Spaniards in 1703, after which it became a rendezvous for pirates, who were extirpated in 1718 by the English, and a regular colonial administration formed. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards, but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed by Great Britain, which was confirmed in their possession at the Peace of Versailles, 1783.

In 1848 the Turks and Caicos Islands were separated from the other Bahamas, and formed into a distinct Presidency, under the Government-in-Chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is very pleasant and salubrious in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada—there being an excellent hotel and other accommodation for tourists. The annual rainfall is 45 inches, the rainy season extending from June to October. The mean temperature is 79.5 degrees, the extreme range being from 70.3 to 87.5.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race. About one quarter are of European descent. English is universally spoken.

Trade and Industry.

The commercial relations of the Colony are mainly with the United States. Considerable quantities of pine-apples, oranges, and bananas are exported.

The sugar-cane grows luxuriantly in many of the islands, and is cultivated to some extent.

The Colony enjoyed great prosperity during the American Civil War, when it was the headquarters of many blockade running operations.

Fishing is extensively carried on, over 100 native-built boats, with 500 men, being employed. Shells, pearls and ambergris are largely exported. Sponge-fishing employs a large fleet, over 60,000l. worth being raised annually. Nassau is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 576 ships registered, of 28,477 tons.

The chief imports are textile fabrics, bread stuffs, and alcohol.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States current coin, silver of the Latin Union, and gold doubloons. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is no Colonial currency, and no paper money. There is no private bank in the Colony, but a Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had on 31st December, 1886, 2,640l. deposited.

Means of Communication.

There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony, and but few good roads except in New Providence. There is regular mail communication with New York, monthly in summer and fortnightly in winter, and frequent vessels to and from Cuba and Key West. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Key West, but messages are always sent via New York or Havana. The rates of postage are:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| Internal | per ½ oz. 1d. | Free. |
| Europe and the United States | 4d. | 1d. per 2 oz. |

Constitution.

The Executive Government is conducted by the Governor, aided by an Executive Council of 9 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council of 9 members, and a Representative Assembly of 29 members. The qualifications of Electors are full age, a residence of 12 months, with land value 5l.; or being a householder of premises value 2l. 8s. in New Providence, or 1l. 4s. elsewhere, for six months. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 200l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members, who have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature.

Education.

There is a Government system of elementary education, established 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, and 1885. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local Committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

There are 33 unsectarian Government schools, with 3,503 scholars, 5 aided schools with 356 scholars, 81 Church of England and 15 private schools with 1,800 scholars. The Government schools were made free in 1885. The compulsory clauses of the law are enforced only in Nassau.
