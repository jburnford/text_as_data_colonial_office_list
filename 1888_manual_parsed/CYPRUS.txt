CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 30' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 15' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from the harbour of Valletta in Malta.

The island has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Dropano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them across the Island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpus Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain bordering the northern shore from Cape S. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and, trending thence along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes have been established the summer quarters of the English troops, and the summer residence of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History.

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in the briefest outline. When the Roman Empire came to be divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and remained under the government of lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England invaded the island to chastise the ruler for the ill-treatment of his fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could neither govern it, nor fulfil the terms of the sale, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem, who promised to take upon himself the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when the widow of the last king of the Lusignan dynasty yielded the government of the island to the Republic of Venice, of which she herself was a subject. Venice ruled the island until 1571, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was in the occupation of the Pasha of Egypt, who was at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1425 to 1571, it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1373 until 1463, when the Lusignan King retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

Climate.

The mean temperature is 66°3°, the extreme range being from 26°5° to 103°0°. The annual rainfall averages about 21 inches, the rainy season being from October to March.

Population.

The population of the several districts ascertained at the census taken in 1881 was as follows:

—Nicosia, 56,812; Famagusta, 38,207; Larnaca, 20,766; Limassol, 29,248; Papho, 28,424; Kyrenia, 13,216. The total population was 186,178, of whom the Moslems form about one-fourth, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church. The estimated present population is 200,000.

Towns.

The chief towns of Cyprus are Nicosia, the seat of government, with a population of 11,586, Larnaca, with a population of 7,833, and Limassol, with a population of 6,006. Both the latter places are on the sea, but are merely roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour; but at present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has no more than 658 inhabitants, nearly all Moslems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 1,906, nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, the modern capital of Papho, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, in the district of the same name, on the north coast. The latter port has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but they have not been worked in modern times. One or two concessions have, however, been recently granted to persons desirous of renewing the mining industry. Gypsum and terra umbra are exported. The wealth of the island consists mainly in its agricultural produce, chiefly corn, cotton, carobs (locust beans), linseed, madder, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, wool, hides, and wine. The common wines are for the most part exported to Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Trieste; but both the common and the richer wines are exported to Austria, Italy, and France, to be used in giving strength and flavour...
to the fruit of poor vineyards. Cyprus wine is somewhat heavy for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it derives from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins.

The agricultural prosperity of the island is greatly retarded by want of water, and by locusts. The rainfall is somewhat deficient in the whole, and has not been made the best use of.

The work of locust destruction has been vigorously prosecuted for the last six years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit system." The screens are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march, and as they are topped with oilcloth, the locusts are unable to get over them, and are gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which they cannot emerge, as they are topped with a zinc lining.

The island has suffered greatly from the extensive destruction of its forests, but what remains of them is reported to be recovering under the better care now bestowed upon them.

Sponge fishing is extensively carried on by Cyprus boats, which take their catch to Smyrna.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, alcohol, iron, leather, and petroleum.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency consists of British gold and silver, with Cyprus copper plastres, of which 9 make one shilling.

There are two banks, the Imperial Ottoman, and the Anglo-Egyptian, each having branches or agencies at Larnaca, Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta, Papho, and Kyrenia.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

Means of Communication.

There is no railway, or navigable water way in the island, but good roads between all important places are now maintained. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 195 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria and Constantinople by the "Austrian Lloyd" and "Messageries Maritimes" steamers. There are also frequent direct steamers to and from Liverpool.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers |
|-----------------------------|
| Within the Island ½ c. p.    |
| England . . . ½ "           |

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of efficient schools was established in 1882. The total grant (£3,000) is divided into two portions, one quarter being shared among the Moslem, and three-quarters among the Christian schools. 11,000 children are at school.

No provision is made for higher or technical education.

Leprosy

Prior to the British occupation, provision was made for only seven lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was, it is stated, originally founded by a charitable Maronite lady.

The asylum has now been improved and enlarged, and accommodates 60 persons, on an enclosed farm of 200 donums, a portion of which the lepers cultivate. In addition each person receives a small Government allowance.

No leper is ever allowed to quit the farm except the village headman, who purchases every morning the daily necessaries for the community.

The census of 1881 returned 78 lepers, or 4 per 10,000 of population, but there are probably a few more in far-outlying villages.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms, the tubercular, and the anaesthetic; of the latter there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis mutilans, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers, toes, and even whole members occurs. In the other form the skin and mucous membranes are the parts chiefly affected, especially the face and head. This form is more common, more dreadful in its effects; and more rapid in its termination, but neither of the two can be called a fatal disease, as their average duration is 10-20 years, and some lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages in the districts of Famagusta and Kyrenia, and cases among Mussulmen are of the greatest rarity. Hereditary infection can be traced in nearly every instance, while malarial taint and improper food appear to be the provoking cause; it is doubtful whether cases ever occur without these two factors. The disease is believed to be slowly decreasing.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkémé-i-Shériféh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be £22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands let or sold during that period.*

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £5,000 a year.
"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Azazi Miriyé vé Emlaki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III."

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer, styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers of pardon, appointment, suspension from office, &c., &c., usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to the Legislative Council has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal, consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to 5l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkemé-i-Shériéh, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi's, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:—

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—
   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.
   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.
   (3) A tax of 8 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males.

3. Tithes of the principal products of the island, assessed in money.

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of 1 per cent. on tithes and certain incomes.

9. Import duties according to the following tariff:—

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. Tithes on certain minor articles have been abolished, and also on grapes; carobs and silk cocoons pay tithe only on exportation. An export duty of 12 per cent. is charged on raisins. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

Total Customs Revenue in 1886-7, £32,878l.

There is a military police force of about 630 men, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its mediæval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1888 by subscription.

NEW GUINEA.

Situation and Area.

New Guinea, the largest island in the world if we exclude Australia, lies some 80 miles to the north of Queensland, between 0° 0' and 12° 0' S.
lat., and between 130° 50' and 154° 30' E. long. Its greatest length is 1,490 miles, and its maximum breadth 430 miles; its area being about 234,768 square miles.

The island is now divided between Holland, Germany, and this country; the areas claimed by Great Britain being about 88,000 square miles.

**Description.**

The northern coast of the island is generally hilly, and the mountains stretch away from it inland, rising in some cases to a height of 17,000 or 18,000 feet. The south coast also, to the east of Torres Straits, presents similar features, and a great mountain range appears to stretch across the island approximately along the 4th parallel of latitude. To the west of Torres Straits the south coast is low and swampy, no hills being visible. Over a great part of the island dense forests appear to prevail, clothing the mountains to a height of several thousand feet with timber of enormous height, covered and matted together with a dense undergrowth of brushwood, ferns, and lycopodiums. The coco palm grows everywhere, and the sago palm abounds on the south coast, and its produce forms a considerable part of the exports of the island. Figs are also common, and ginger, cardamum, betel, pineapple, nutmeg, cotton, and other smaller growths are found.

The bulk of the population is of the pure Papuan type, of a sooty brown colour, medium height, and general appearance somewhat negroid. At various points of the coast however the intermixture of Polynesian and Malayan blood has modified the native Papuan physically and mentally, and the coast tribes as a rule are superior in resources and civilization to those of the interior. Some of the tribes in the north-west, in the Arfak mountains and elsewhere, are very degraded, and with barely the rudiments of social organization; and cannibalism and head-hunting are practised here and there throughout the island.

**History.**

The island was first discovered in 1511 by Antonio de Abrea, and was occasionally touched at by the early navigators, but no settlement was made until the Dutch annexed some parts of the western coast in the 18th century, as adjuncts to their Batavian Colony. In 1793 the East India Company formally annexed the island, and formed a small post at Geeloing Bay. This was however soon abandoned, and nothing was done in the matter until recent years.

The whole island to the west of 141 E. long. is claimed by the Dutch as suzerains of the Sultan of Tidore, to whom the tribes along the coast have been accustomed to pay tribute. The acquisition of the remainder of the island by this country has long been advocated by Australian statesmen, and the growing influence of France and Germany in the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the establishment of a penal settlement by the former in New Caledonia, created considerable alarm lest a country lying so near the shores of Australia should pass into the possession of a foreign power. The Government of Queensland determined to formally annex the country, and this was accordingly done by Mr. Chester, the magistrate of Thursday Island, on the 4th of April, 1883. This proceeding was not adopted or ratified by the Imperial Government, and consequently fell to the ground; but the Intercolonial Convention held at Sydney in Nov. and Dec., 1883, passed resolutions urging the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, and undertaking to recommend to their respective legislatures to provide for defraying, in proportion to population, a part of the cost of maintaining the protectorate. Upon this the Imperial Government decided that if one or more of the colonies would guarantee 15,000l. a year they would appoint a high commissioner for the south-eastern part of New Guinea, and take steps for establishing his jurisdiction. The various colonies readily agreed to contribute their quota of the sum required, and on the 6th November, 1884, Commodore Erskine, in H.M.S. "Nelson," hoisted the British flag at Port Moresby, and proclaimed a protectorate over the south coast from 141° E. long. and the adjacent islands, the principal being the Trobriand, Woodlark, D'Entrecasteaux, and Louisiade groups. The northern boundary was finally fixed by arrangement with Germany as commencing at a point near Mitre Rock, on the N.E. coast on the 8th par. of lat., following this parallel to the 147th meridian, thence in a straight line to where the 6th parallel cuts the 144th meridian, thence to where the 5th parallel cuts the 141st meridian.

General Sir Peter Scratchley was appointed Special Commissioner for the British Protectorate, and proceeded to New Guinea in 1885, but succumbed shortly after to malarial fever. He was succeeded by the Hon. John Douglas, C.M.G., formerly Premier of Queensland. At the Colonial Conference the Colonies of Queensland, N.S. Wales and Victoria undertook to guarantee 15,000l. a year for the cost of administering the territory, on the understanding that Her Majesty's Sovereignty would be declared over it, and on the passing of the necessary Colonial legislation this will be done.

**Industry.**

Persons desirous of exploring the country or trading must apply for permits. Vessels trading to New Guinea must proceed to Port Moresby or Samarins, the only ports of entry. No firearms, explosives, or spirituous liquors may be imported, and no settlement or acquisition of land is allowed. The white population numbers about 50, principally engaged in connection with the "Béche de mer" fishery. The native population has been estimated vaguely at 2,000,000, but is not probably over 150,000.

Special Commissioner for New Guinea, John Douglas, C.M.G., 2,500l.
Assistant Commissioner, Anthony Musgrave, 700l.
Deputy Commissioner, Hugh Romilly, C.M.G., 200l. (and 500l. from Western Pacific High Commission).

**NIGER PROTECTORATE.**

The British Protectorate over the entire basin of the Lower Niger, including the Benin and Cross Rivers, was formally assumed in July, 1884, when regular treaties of protection were concluded by Consul Hewett with all the principal Chiefs. It extends along the coast of Africa from the Benin River (where it joins the boundary of Lagos) to the mouth of the Rio del Rey at 9° east longitude. Inland the Protectorate includes the whole basins of the Lower Niger and Binué up to and beyond the Boussa rapids on the former, and Jin on the
latter, in about 10° north latitude. The settlement of the Baptist Missionary Society at Victoria, Amboise (or Ambas) Bay was formally British territory, having been formally annexed in July, 1884. It was however ceded to the German Empire, which has acquired by purchase the rights of the Baptist Missionary Society, the transfer of sovereignty taking place on the 29th March, 1887.

The whole of these vast districts are under the general supervision of the British Consul for the Rights of Benin and Biafra, but on the 10th of July, 1886, a Royal Charter was granted to the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), by which extensive powers of administration were conferred upon them in the territories over which they have treaty rights, including a belt of 30 miles on each bank of the Niger and Binué. The operations of the Company extend as far inland as Gando and Sokato, with the Sultans of which countries treaties have been concluded. The Company's operations on the sea coast are mainly confined to Akassa, the Nün entrance to the Niger. The British Consular jurisdiction is chiefly exercised in the river mouths between the Benin, Brass, and the Old Calabar Rivers.

Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, in cable communication with Lagos, and thus with Europe. Regular steamers arrive and depart from Liverpool and the South-West Coast of Africa every three weeks. Communication in the Niger Basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.

Industry.

An enormous trade, wholly in the hands of English firms, is done in the Protectorate, mainly with this country, Germany, and France. There are extensive depôts in all the river mouths of the delta, from which palm oil and kernels, with some ebony, are exported. The internal trade of the Niger and Binué is almost entirely done by the Royal Niger Company, whose chief depot is Akassa. Besides the articles already mentioned, ivory, india-rubber, shea butter and beni-seed are exported by the Company, which has over 150 "factories."

The imports consist of cotton goods, spirits, hardware, guns, gunpowder, salt, silks, and coral. The steamers of the Company navigate the Niger up to the rapids of Boussa, 460 miles from the sea, and for 450 miles of the course of the Binué, which falls into the Niger at Igbege, 290 miles from the sea. No statistics as to the amount of trade are available.

Customs Tariff of the Royal Niger Company (payable at Akassa and Lokoja):

| Import Duties (Akassa) | s. d. |
|------------------------|------|
| Spirits, per imperial gallon | 2 0 |
| Tobacco, per lb. | 0 6 |
| Salt, per cwt. | 1 0 |

War material (arms, powder, &c.), 100 per cent. ad val.

All other merchandise, except coal, 2 per cent. ad val.

In addition, similar duties are payable at Lokoja (except that the ad val. duty is 10 per cent.), so that the total dues on imports above Lokoja are double the above.

Export Duties (Akassa).

| Export Duties (Akassa) | s. d. |
|------------------------|------|
| Palm kernels, per cwt. | 0 2 |
| Palm oil and shea butter, per gallon | 0 1 |
| Ivory, per lb. | 1 0 |

All other native produce, 20 per cent. ad val.

There are no customs duties at the other ports on the coast.

Administration.

No interference in the domestic government of the native chiefs is contemplated, but disputes are settled and much indirect influence is exercised by the British Consuls under the general direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Civil and criminal jurisdiction over British subjects is exercised in the Consular Courts (under the West Africa Order in Council, 1885), subject to appeal to the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone or the Gold Coast Colony. Within the territories of the Royal Niger Company civil and criminal jurisdiction is exercised by the officers of that Company under the powers given by the Charter. The judicial system is at present being organised by Sir James Marshall, C.M.G.

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these Islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, or New South Wales, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised power, and includes British New Guinea, the Louisiade Archi-
pelago, the Southern Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, the Tongan or Friendly Islands, the Samoan or Navigators Islands, and the various small groups of Melanesia. The Protectorate established by Her Majesty's Government over part of New Guinea and adjacent islands is administered by a Special Commissioner, but for judicial purposes it remains under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner's Court for the Western Pacific.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a judicial commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of her Majesty.

The High Commissioners' Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have jurisdiction civil and criminal analogous to that of Stipendiary Magistrates and Judges of County Courts with certain limited powers in respect of probate and letters of administration.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of her Majesty's ships of war on the Australian station have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

Establishment.

High Commissioner, Sir J. B. Thurston, K.C.M.G., 300l. (in addition to salary as Chief Justice of Fiji).

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POSSESSIONS.

ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England, the whole area being about seventy square miles. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory, and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepôt for the trade with Arabia. The imports in 1888 amounted to 2,014,580l., and the exports to 1,444,890l. The exports consist of coffee, dyes, feathers, gums, spices, &c. The settlement is subject to the government of Bombay, being presided over by a president, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison. (For further information see publications relating to India).

PERIM, an island situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, is a dependency of Aden, and in consideration of an undertaking not to cede to any other Power than Great Britain.

SOCOTRA, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belongs. The area of the island is about 3,000 square miles, and its population about 4,000, of Arab descent. It was formally annexed in October, 1886.
