CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 51' N. lat., and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.: its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondera Head, is 266 miles; its greatest width 140 miles, from Colombo on the west coast, to Sangemankande on the east. Its area is 24,702 square miles.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustan. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual rainfall is about 100 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November.

History.

The great Indian epic, the Ramayana, has a chapter describing Ceylon at least ten centuries before the Christian era, but the authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced 306 B.C., and from that date the faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity and inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians: in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a
separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands were transferred to the Government of the Straits Settlements in 1886.

The Maldive Archipelago, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probable Aryan original stock speaking a dialect akin to the Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

**Constitution.**

By letters patent under the Great Seal, April 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and the Auditor-General; and a nominated Legislative Council of 15 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and six unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into eight Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the natives.

**Defence.**

Rs.600,000 per annum are paid to the Imperial Government as the cost of the European garrison, the nominal strength of which is 1,092 men. Trincomalee is a Naval Station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1886, consisted of 712 of all ranks.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1881 to be 2,763,984, being an increase of 14·67 per cent. on the population of 1871. The present estimated population is 3,000,000. The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 110,502; Kandy, 22,026; Galle, 31,748; Trincomalee, 9,781; Jaffna, 39,855; Badulla, 4,766.

The number of Indian coolies on coffee estates is about 125,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 210,000.

The area of the Colony is 24,702 square miles, or 16,233,600 acres; and rather more than one-fifth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone at an altitude of from 1,500 to 6,000 feet above the sea level. The most important productions are:

- Rice, 605,000 acres; other Grain, roughly estimated at about 109,000 acres;
- Coffee, 136,000 acres;
- Tea, 160,000 acres;
- Cinchona, 48,000 acres;
- Coconuts, 608,000 acres;
- Cinnamon, 36,000 acres;
- Tobacco, 18,000 acres;
- Areka, Palmyrah, and other Palms, 100,000 acres;
- Cacao, 12,500 acres.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, a land revenue (usually one-tenth of the production of grain), Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The grand total of revenue for 1886—12,682,548 rupees—is exclusive of the local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Matara, Puttalam, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Kurunegala, Badulla, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Katnapura. The total amount of local taxation averages 1,500,000 rupees per annum.

The value of coffee exported in 1886 was 8,079,017 rupees; the bulk of it, to the value of 6,054,979, being shipped to England. Cinchona and tea, rated at 4,370,250 rupees and 5,102,427 rupees respectively, were exported.

Colombo, Galle, Jaffna, and Trincomalee are ports of registry, and had on the 31st December, 1886, 465 vessels registered, of together 27,242 tons.

**Law and Justice.**

The basis of the law is the Roman Dutch law, much modified by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the Civil law is now under consideration.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Ganabáwas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

**Education.**

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars at the end of 1886 in Government schools was 29,663, and in schools aided and inspected by Government was 59,868, and the cost 489,697 rupees, as compared with 1888, when the number was 6,879, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government Schools are...
all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for Vernacular Education, although small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local effort, owing to retrenchment; the Department having been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid High Schools.

There is one school of agriculture at Colombo which was opened at the beginning of 1884, and in 1885 agricultural instructors for six out-station Government Schools have been sanctioned. Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are seven.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is almost exclusively Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, which is alone legal tender. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank will remain in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its present charter expires, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue, of which the amount on the 31st December, 1886, was 5,012,165 rupees. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London and China; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India; and the New Oriental Banking Corporation. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon. The Chartered Mercantile Bank had Rs. 4,140,606, and the Madras Bank Rs. 14,287,243 deposits in the island on 31st December, 1886.

The Ceylon Savings Bank, established in 1832, had, on the 31st December, 1886, 2,097,371 rupees deposited. Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885, and had on 31st December, 1886, Rs. 81,196 deposited through 72 offices.

Public Works.

The Colombo breakwater was commenced in 1875 and is now complete. A single arm composed of large concrete blocks on a rubble foundation running from the shore, a distance of 4,200 feet, in a northerly direction, terminates with a slight curve. The work cost nearly 695,000L

Works are being constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo, the estimated cost of which is 831,000L.

The Government maintains 59 hospitals, 2 asylums, and 50 outdoor dispensaries, and a medical staff of 56 qualified medical officers, equally distributed throughout the island, at an annual cost amounting in 1886 to Rs. 561,346, besides 27 more on the Coolie estates, at a cost of Rs. 149,172.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—1,203 miles are open in Ceylon. There are 177 miles of railway, all owned and worked by the Government. The lines run from Colombo to Kandy (74 miles), Peradeniya to Nanu-Oya (58 miles), Kandy to Matate (17 miles), and Colombo to Kalutara (28 miles). The total cost of construction was Rs. 36,506,112; the receipts during 1886, Rs. 2,707,429, and the expenses Rs. 1,451,716. Of metallised roads, there are 1,404 miles; of gravelled and natural roads, 859 and 630 miles; of canals, 167 miles. This is exclusive of roads within Municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees who collect the commutation received during 1885 a revenue of 969,926 rupees; but the amount derived from this source is insignificant as compared with the outlay. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new water works. The amount expended in 1886 was Rs. 550,908.

Means of Communications.

A fortnightly mail service is carried on by the steamers of the P. and O. Company between Ceylon and Brindisi, Venice, and intermediate ports and Bombay on one side, and Madras, Calcutta, Straits, and China on the other; also a monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. There is also a fortnightly mail service by the steamers of the M. M. Company between Ceylon, Naples, and Marseilles, and between Ceylon and Calcutta, Straits and China. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 18 to 21 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 7, and 15 days respectively.

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austrian Lloyd’s, and the Norddeutsche Lloyd Companies. The steamers of the former leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.

Rates of Postage.

Internal, per ½ oz. 5 cents.
To India 15 "
England per ½ oz. 28 "

Ceylon is in direct telegraphic communication with India, and thence with Europe and the East, by a cable which starts from Talamannai, and crosses the Paambon Channel.
