JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 43' and 18° 32', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 20'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,193 square miles. There are 198 sugar estates in operation.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 75° 30' and 80° 35' W. long., are dependencies of Jamaica. The largest of the islands, Grand Cayman, contains about 2,000 inhabitants, who as well as the inhabitants of the other two, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are mainly engaged in catching turtle for export. Pedro and Morant Cays are also dependencies.

‡ $1,440, rising by $96 yearly to $1,920.

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,688,520 acres, from which may be deducted 365,828 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,317,692 acres available for cultivation. Of this 592,405 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1884. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. After the capture of the island, until the Restoration of Charles II, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction. In 1660 the first establishment of a regular civil government was made by Charles II, who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. In 1807 the Slave Trade was abolished, at which time there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1838, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is about 80°, rising to 90° in the day time, and falling to 70° at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, and as there is a lofty range of mountains which run down the middle of the whole island, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers. The annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 30 inches to as much as 180 inches.

Only two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, four-fifths being pure negroes. There are about 12,000 imported coolies. English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, which, after existing for nearly 200 years in Jamaica, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members.

After the suppression of disaffection in the Colony in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created.

The Legislature willingly responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.
A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated the 19th of May, 1884, the constitution of the Legislative Council was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor and four ex officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Director of Public Works, and such other persons not exceeding five in number as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and nine persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved. The first general election was completed on the 12th September, 1884, and the Council met on the 30th idem.

There is also a Privy Council, consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of Her Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum. The Governor is to consult in all cases with the Councilors, excepting only when the case is of such a nature that this service would in his judgment sustain material prejudice by consultation, or when the matters to be decided are too unimportant to require their advice, or too urgent to admit of the necessary delay; and he is to propose all questions on which they are to advise and decide; but any member may apply in writing for permission to propose a question, and the member may record upon the minutes his written application and the Governor's answer. The Governor is authorised to act in opposition to the advice and decision of the Privy Council, "if in any case it shall appear right so to do," and he must report to the Secretary of State for the Colonies "the grounds and reasons" of his opposition, and any member may record on the minutes the nature of the advice or opinion brought under the consideration of the Privy Council.

Local Administration.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 13 other parishes, under Law 16 of 1885, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, water works, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population 38,566), Spanish Town (population 5,689), Montego Bay (population 4,651), Falmouth (population 3,029), and Port Maria (population 6,741).

The number of parishes (which are the units of local government) has been reduced from 22 to 14. Each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., almshouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The several direct taxes received on land, houses, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected.

There is a High Court of Justice, and Petty Sessions of magistrates throughout the island. The inferior tribunals are about to be re-organised.

District courts, somewhat on the model of County Courts in England, are held all over the island. The judges are barristers or advocates, but this system is about undergoing a change in the substitution of Resident District Court Judges under a recently enacted Law.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are 18 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), an Inspector-General, and 693 sub-officers and men, distributed throughout the island.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons. The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty; the excise on rum (80,000£), and stamps and licenses. There is no direct taxation except that of the local boards, and the total of the direct taxes on land is less than 12,000£.

Currency and Banking.

British currency, United States gold, and gold doubloons are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000£. The Colonial Bank is the only private banking establishment in the colony (1 branch and 4 agencies); it has a note circulation estimated at 125,000£.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent. The total deposits on 31st December, 1886, were 848,529£.

Education.

Elementary education is left to private enterprise, aided, since 1867, by a system of grants in aid from the Colonial revenue. The number of schools is 663, with 57,557 scholars; small fees are charged. The Colonial Government maintains a system of inspection, and has provided two training colleges, for male and female teachers respectively, which are wholly supported from public funds. No provision is made from public funds for secondary or technical education, but there are some endowed schools and some scholarships tenable at the English universities.

Industry.

The chief crops are sugar, coffee, ginger and pimento, and the exports comprise, in addition to those products, rum, dyewoods, fruit, &c. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations. The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, alcohol, and building materials. Falmouth, Kingston, Montego Bay, St. Ann's Bay, and Savanna la Mar are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 67 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 5,590.

Means of Communication.

There is a regular postal service throughout the
island daily between some places, and elsewhere three times per week by means of mail coaches.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Internal: Kingston, Spanish Town, and other places within daily limit, per ½ oz. | 1 ½d. each. |
| --- | --- |
| Ditto, elsewhere | 2 ½d. each. |

To Postal Union and Australasia

| Hayti | 2½d. per 4ozs. |
| Africa | 9½d. per 4ozs. |
| China | 8½d. per 4ozs. |

Parcels post with England, 9d. per lb.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail contract steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Thursday throughout the year. The average passage is 17 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 43 stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 604. The total cost of the telegraphs has been £15,802. 0s. 5d. The receipts in 1886 were £4,054l., and the expenses £3,928l.

The Government Railway extends from Kingston to Porus, in the parish of Manchester, in one direction, a distance of 47 miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line of 17 miles. The total length of line open is 64 miles, constructed at a cost of £775,000l. The railway receipts in 1885-86 were £84,772l., and the expenses £27,908l.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.
