BRITISH HONDURAS.

Situation and Area.

British Honduras is a colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the rapids of Gracias a Dios on the River Sarstoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier—being the western boundary, as defined by the Convention of 1859 with Guatemala—on the south by Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18°29' and 15°54' N. Latitude and 89°10' and 87°50' W. Longitude.

The area of the Colony is 7,562 square miles, including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George's, English, Turnefle, and other Cays, 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. Little over 20 square miles is under regular cultivation.

History.

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica about 1638, by adventurers who were attracted by the fine timber (logwood and mahogany) which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers.

From that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants, aided by a ship of the Royal Navy, the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms; and treaty after treaty was concluded, which had little other effect than to stimulate the enterprise of the settlers by the recognition, thus step by step accorded, of the footing they had gained for themselves in Central America, without, in the first instance, any thought of territorial aggrandisement, but solely in pursuit of the industry in which their fortunes were embarked.

The only subsequent events of external significance which need here be noticed, are the definition, as above, of its general boundaries (of which survey has been partially executed); the frequent border troubles, connected with the revolt in 1849 of the Indian population of Yucatan against the Spanish inhabitants, the result of which has been that the Indians are now de facto in possession of the country to a considerable distance north of the Hondo; and the quarrels of the Ycaicche and Santa Cruz tribes of Indians, in which it has been involved.

Constitution.

The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1756 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790-1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1839 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted, consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on the 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, which is still in force, and a Legislative Council substituted therefor, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial members, with the Lieutenant-Governor as President. On the 31st October, 1884, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica. The English Common Law is in force, so far as applicable, modified by Colonial ordinances.

General Description.

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached, from the Savannah, through the Pine Ridge, the Cahoon Ridge, and the Forest, to the central mountain zone.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscomb Mountains a height of some 4,000 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pasturage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, which was full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. The soil generally was rich, but a few rugged spots were encountered. Some fine gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered, and other indications of minerals were noticed.

The Pine and Cahoon Ridges afford abundant pasturage for cattle, and the higher grounds would doubtless produce, at altitudes varying from 600 to 2,000 feet, as marketable a quality of coffee as any that is brought for export from the neighbouring Republics.

There seems to be no tropical product to which the climate and soil are not adapted. In the forests and wilds are found the cedar, rosewood, bullet-tree, fustic, lignum vitae, sapodilla, Santa Maria, ironwood, red and white pine, indiarubber and gutta-percha trees, and the sarsaparilla, cochil neal-cactus, Agave or Pita indigo, and many other useful plants or shrubs. The coconut flourishes, as does the Cahoon palm and the ground-nut.

The cultivation of fruit (bananas and plantains), and its shipment to New Orleans, is gradually extending, and proving remunerative to planters. Fruit trees, spices, and cocoas are being planted, and promise a new field of development. Arrangements are being made to ship fruit to the European markets in steamers fitted with refrigerating apparatus.

The climate, though damp, is, for the tropics, healthy. Visitations of malignant fever or cholera are of rare occurrence, and an equable temperature, with a prevailing sea-breeze, is experienced throughout the greater part of the year. The temperature ranges from 56° to 96°, and averages 78°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

Industry.

The chief industry is wood cutting, now 200 years old. Three million feet of mahogany and 17,000 tons of logwood are, on an average, exported annually. There are, however, also 61 sugar mills, and large fruit plantations.

The chief exports are logwood, mahogany, sugar, fruit, indiarubber, tortoiseshell and sarsaparilla. Belize is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1886, 170 vessels, of 4,302 aggregate tonnage.

Communications.

There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony, and the easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is regular communication every ten days by mail steamers with New Orleans, Puerto Cortez, and Truxillo; monthly with New York and Costa Rica; every five weeks with London and Nassau; and monthly with Liverpool, the West Indies and Colon. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Livingstone, U.S., whence the steamer takes one day.

Rates of Postage.

There are post offices at Belize, Corosol, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda, and Mullins River.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation are principally Central American silver dollars. Accounts are kept in dollars. There is no paper currency. The currency is now regulated by the Order in Council of 15th September, 1887. The standard of value is the Guatemalan dollar. Venezuelan, Honduras, Mexican, Chilian, Uruguayan, Colombian and Peruvian silver coins are also current and legal tender, as well as a colonial currency of one-cent pieces, at fixed ratings with the Guatemalan dollar. Dollars are legal tender to any amount, but smaller silver coins only to the extent of 50 dollars, and the cent pieces only to half a dollar. There are no private banks in the Colony. The Government
Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corosol and Orange Walk), had, on 31st December, 1886, $37,405 deposited.

Education.

The schools are denominational, inspected and aided by the Colonial Government. Twenty-five received aid in 1886 to the extent of $9,904, with 2,527 scholars on the roll, and 1,770 average attendance.

Public Debt, $268,750.

The population on 5th April, 1881, was reported as follows:—
