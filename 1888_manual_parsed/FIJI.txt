FIJI.

Situation and Area.
The Colony of Fiji comprises the islands lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° West and 175° East. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,300 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 800 miles to the north-west, and Samoa 500 miles to the south-west. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 500 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,022 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,938 square miles, Tavuni, 166 square miles, Kadavu, 129 square miles, Goro, 39 square miles, Gau, 40 square miles, and Ovalau, 39 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 6,876 square miles.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Pandora" in 1798, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty."

Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hoflua, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village.

In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the island to Great Britain, and it was annexed 13th May, 1881.

The population is estimated at 2,300, of whom four fifths are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics.

The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres.

Population.
The aboriginal population belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received some admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1874 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was again reduced. In 1886 the total population, including that of Rotumah, was estimated at 124,742, comprising 110,037 native Fijians, 6,146 Indian immigrants, and 2,105 Europeans, the remainder being mainly Polynesians, with a few half castes and Chinese.

History.
In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war...
led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king, and met with general acceptance. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakomban, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874; the form of government, the land question, and the various pecuniary questions then pending being virtually left to the discretion of Her Majesty. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and enteric diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable in Fiji.

The highest shade temperature in 1886 was 92° in the month of December, and the lowest 65° in June, July, August, and November. The total rainfall during the year was at Suva 85-07 inches.

Constitution.

The Legislative Council consists of six official and five non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 550 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva exceeds 700. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and on 31st December, 1886, 17 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 772 tons.

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000l. to 17,000l. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce valued at the rate to be paid by the contractor for the year.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money.

The system, though open to some objections, may, on the whole, be considered to have been remarkably successful. As the people have little or no money, and live, for the most part, where they are unable to earn any without hiring themselves out for long periods, it is believed that in no other way could such a revenue have been obtained with so little pressure, while the system has this collateral advantage, that being worked almost entirely by the natives' own political and social organization, it tends to preserve the latter, and thus to save much expense in administration.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

The town board is also the school board in each town, and a rate of 6d. in the pound is paid for school purposes under Ordinance No. 37 of 1885.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board, and a grant not exceeding one-half of the amount required for specified expenses beyond the sum raised by school fees, to any school board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1886 was: Suva town board, 1,940l.; ditto school board, 764l.; Levuka town board, 1,930l.; ditto school board, 1,845l.; ditto school board, 1,124l.; and 1,058l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The following banks have branches in Fiji, viz.: The Bank of New Zealand (Suva and Levuka).

The Union Bank of Australia, Limited (Suva). Provision is made by ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue. The Mortgage and Agency Company of Australasia, Limited, and The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, Limited, act as loan and mortgage companies.

Industries.

The chief products are sugar, copra, cotton, coffee, tea, maize, and fruit, principally bananas. The export of sugar in 1886 was 11,716 tons, from an area of 10,500 acres; of copra 5,217 tons, from an area of 18,128 acres; cotton 52 tons, from 95 acres; coffee 31 tons, from 309 acres; tea about
2 tons, from 805 acres; maize 7,600 bushels and fruit to the value of 28,059l.

Education.

A government system of elementary education is established under the Public Schools ordinance of 1882. The management is vested in elected school boards. There are two common schools, with head and assistant teachers: Suva, 165 scholars; Levuka, 103 scholars. These common schools receive a grant in aid from the public revenues.

The Public Schools ordinance also provides for the establishment of high schools for advanced education.

There is a Government industrial school for native youths on Vanua Levu, attended by 94 scholars, which is partially self-supporting. The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic Missions provide for the education of the natives everywhere throughout the group.

Wesleyan schools, 1886, 1,765, native teachers, 2,526, scholars 40,718.

Roman Catholic Sunday schools 84, scholars 1,040.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony: Sydney, (8 days), Melbourne (10 days), Auckland (4 days), New Caledonia (3 days), Tonga (2 days).

Postal duties to the United Kingdom, via San Francisco, 8d. per ½ oz., via Brindisi, &c., 10d. per ½ oz.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand, 2d. per ½ oz. Internal postal rates: town 1d., country 2d. per ½ oz.; newspapers 1d. to all places within or beyond the colony.

There is no railway or telegraph in the colony, and it is not connected with any telegraph cable. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Auckland (N.Z.) and Sydney (N.S.W.). Communication between the islands is maintained by native sailing boats. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands.
