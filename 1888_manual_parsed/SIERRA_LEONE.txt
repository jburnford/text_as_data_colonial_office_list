SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

Sierra Leone proper consists of a peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, and bounded on the north by a river of the same name. The Cape lies in 8° 30' N. lat., 13° 18' W. long. The peninsula is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth, with an area of 300 square miles. The Settlement now includes the whole of the coast southward to the Mannah River, which forms the Liberian boundary, and northward to the Scarcies district, as well as the island of Sherboro, the Isles de Los, and the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellaboi, Cor-teemo, Tasso, Macauley, and other islets.

The extreme length of the Settlement is over 180 miles, and its area about 3,000 square miles.

History.

The oldest settlement is that of the peninsula of Sierra Leone, which was ceded to Great Britain in 1787 by the native chiefs. Four years afterwards a charter was granted to a Company under the name of "The Sierra Leone Company," for the purpose of establishing a settlement for freed negro slaves. In 1800 a grant of the peninsula was made to the Company by Letters Patent, and a Court of Directors of the Company was empowered to appoint a Governor and Council, the former having power to enact laws. In 1807, on the abolition of the slave trade, the colony was transferred back to the Crown. In 1821, on the abolition of the African Company (see under Gold Coast), the whole of the British possessions in West Africa were united into the Colony of the West Africa Settlements. The Gold Coast was, however, soon abandoned to
the merchants, and the Gambia was made a separate Colony in 1843. These were not reunited to the Colony until 1865.

In 1862 two large tracts of country called British Quiah and Sherbro were handed over by treaty to the Colony. In 1879 further territory was acquired in the Scarcies River to the north of the peninsula. In 1884 the seaboard of the Sulymah and Gallinas Chiefs as far as the Mannah River was also annexed.

**Constitution.**

By a Charter issued on May 27, 1863, an Executive Council was created, composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

In 1865, it was decided that a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa should be established, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone. This change was effected by a Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1886.

By a new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, was revoked as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos, under the Government-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements; and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter was then issued, dated 17th of December, 1874, which erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," and created a legislative council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent have since been issued, dated 17th June, 1885, providing for the continuance of the Government on the same lines, with some minor differences. There is an executive council at Sierra Leone, and the power of pardon and suspension is given to the Governor-in-Chief.

**General Description.**

The capital, Freetown, lies about 4 miles up the Sierra Leone River at the foot of a chain of hills rising 1,700 feet. It contains 21,000 inhabitants, and possesses the best harbour in West Africa. It is an important coaling station and commercial entrepôt. It has been selected as a second class Imperial coaling station, and important defence works have been erected to protect the harbour. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 27 vessels registered, of 858 tons.

The Colony contains many different races of inhabitants, including a large number of Mahomedan negroes. Treaties of friendship have long existed with the native chiefs beyond British territory as far inland as Foutah, and annual stipends are paid to many of them in return for their protection of commerce and the internal roads.

**Industry.**

Most of the inhabitants are engaged in trade in the products of the interior, the principal exports being palm oil and kernels, beni seed, ground nuts, cola nuts, indiarubber, copal, hides, and ginger. Agriculture is much neglected, and there are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths, boat-building, and mat-making. The natives of Sierra Leone are to be found engaged as traders on the Niger and in all the commercial centres of the West Coast. The imports are chiefly spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, and hardware.

**Currency and Banking.**

Besides British currency, gold doubloons, eagles, and the coins of the Latin Union are current and legal tender. There is no Colonial coinage, and no note circulation. No private banks exist, but a Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had in 1886 £8,142l. deposited, belonging to 386 depositors.

**Education.**

A system of Government grants and inspection was established in 1882. The schools, 61 in number, with 6,917 scholars, are all denominational, and charge fees. Education is not compulsory. The Church Missionary Society has a successful secondary school and training college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University.

(instead of 6d.); and 5 per cent. ad valorem on all other goods imported.

**Means of Communication.**

Steamers leave Liverpool for Madeira and Freetown every Saturday, and the average length of passage is 7 days to Madeira, and 8 or 9 days from Madeira to Freetown.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables,
direct to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively.

There are no railways or internal telegraphs. Horses do not thrive, and there is but little wheel traffic and few roads fit for it. Internal communication is mainly kept up by the network of rivers and lagoons.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers. | per oz. | per 4 oz. |

| Europe and United States | 4 d.    |           |

**Climate.**

The climate of Sierra Leone is unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The seasons are divided into wet and dry; the former commencing in May, and lasting till October. The beginning and ending of the wet season are the most sickly periods of the year.

The rain-fall during the past four years has averaged over 162 inches in Freetown.

THE GAMBIA.

Situation and Area.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a-half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, and separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek, now crossed by a pile bridge. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Settlement on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Combo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and 180 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river, the whole of the latter being British waters. The total area of the Settlement is about 69 square miles.

History.

The Gambia was discovered in the voyages of the early Portuguese navigators, but no settlement was made there.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in Exeter to trade in the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for the purpose of carrying on the trade. It was not successful, and another established two years later experienced a like want of success. In 1664 a fort was built on the Island, now known as Fort James.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, it appears that the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade (1807) till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary by British merchants from Senegal.

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France in the treaty of 1783, with the exception of a French factory which was subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. These two exceptional rights were exchanged in 1857.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821, till in 1843 it was created an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of West Africa Settlements, and continues to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, by letters patent of the 17th June, 1885.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1827; and British Combo was granted by the King of Combo in various cessions in 1840, 1850, and 1855.

Industry.

The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton, maize, corn, palm kernels, indiarubber, cola nuts, wax, and native "pagns" or country cloths. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into these native cloths called pagns, the manufacture of vegetable oils, boat building, and some brick making, there are no manufacturing industries worth the name in the country.

A considerable trade is done, from Bathurst as an entrepôt, with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts, in cotton goods, spirits, rice, cola nuts, and hardware. Most of the exports go to France, and the bulk of the imports come from England. The tonnage of shipping entered in 1885 was 81,683 tons. Bathurst is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 120 vessels registered, of 2,066 tons. The ground nut is the staple product of the Settlement. It is planted in June, and reaped in November, and largely exported to the South of Europe for the extraction of oil. The industry began in 1845, reached its climax in 1858, and has since declined, owing to the competition of other oil materials.

Relations with the Interior.

The Administrator of the Gambia exercises no jurisdiction over the population surrounding the
British settlements, but friendly relations are cultivated with the native tribes, with whom much trade is done. Stipends are paid and frequent presents made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the roads open.

In the early part of the year 1881 an expedition (The Upper Gambia Expedition), under the command of Dr. Gouldsbury, Administrator of the Gambia, set out from the settlement for the purpose of examining the upper river, with a view of ascertaining its capabilities as a highway for trade between the coast and the interior, and also with the object of reaching Timbo, the capital of the extensive Futa Jallon country, and from thence returning to the coast at Sierra Leone.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is that of the Latin Union; there is no Colonial coinage and no note issue. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec. 1887, but there are no private banks.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants in aid. There is one Anglican school (free), 8 Mohammedan, 3 Wesleyan, and 2 Roman Catholic, with about 1,800 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory, and fees are charged.

Means of Communication.

The Liverpool mail steamers call every three weeks, and there is also regular communication via Dakar with Bordeaux. Four telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs or metalled roads, but horses will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 300 miles. The postage of letters to Europe, United States, and West Africa, is 4d. per. ½ oz. There is no internal post.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is fairly healthy during the dry season. The mean temperature is 75°, the annual range being from 63° to 94°. The rainfall is about 44 inches, the rainy season being from June to October, and the cool Harmattan from November to February.

The inhabitants are most of the negro race, the chief tribes being the Jollofs, Mandingoes, and Jollohs. There are about 25 Europeans in the colony, out of a population, in 1881, of 14,150. The town of Bathurst contains about 6,000 inhabitants.
