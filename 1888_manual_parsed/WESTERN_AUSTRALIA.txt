WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.
Western Australia comprises more than one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. Longitude. The total area is 1,060,000 square miles. The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

History.
In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1828 Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, R.N., in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and on the 1st of June, 1829, founded the colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886. During the last five years the Colony has greatly progressed in every way, and it now contains an energetic people, rapidly increasing in number, with flourishing and expanding industries.

Constitution and Government.
The constitution is what is called "Representative." The Government is administered by a Governor appointed by the Crown, and assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and under the Royal Instructions, power is given to the Governor also to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There is a Legislative Council consisting of the members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members. This Council is presided over by a Speaker.

The franchise for electors is 100l. freehold, or householders of 10l. annual value, or lessees of Crown lands to the same amount annual rent. The qualification for members is the possession of 1,000l. freehold beyond encumbrances.

There are 14 electoral districts, Perth, Fremantle, and the North District, return two members each, and the remaining districts one member each.
Local Government.

Under Act 40 Vict., No. 13, as amended by 42 Vict., No. 16, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound in any one year upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the Council of the municipality. The following ten municipalities have been proclaimed: Perth, Fremantle, Albany, Geraldton, Bunbury, Russellton, Guildford, York, Newcastle, and Northam. The municipal councils consist of a mayor and councillors, the mayor being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. 15,410l. was granted in 1886 to district roads boards (of which there are thirty), and municipal councils for the repair and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony. Perth and Fremantle, the only councils for which figures are available, had together in 1886 a revenue of 10,120l., and an expenditure 9,912l. Their debt at the end of 1886 was 30,000l.

Population.

The total population of the Colony is as yet only 39,584 souls, excluding the aboriginal natives. These numbers, however, as stated are rapidly being augmented, both by immigrants in the south, and by the influx of gold-diggers in the north.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 2,895 square miles only have been alienated from the Crown, while 201,904 square miles are leased for pastoral purposes. No less than 855,208 square miles are still unoccupied and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line of the colony, a length of 3,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, three hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley and Eucla districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, the rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes, but Geraldton is the centre of a fertile and flourishing agricultural district. In the south-west corner of the colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is about 86,000 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers."

Industry.

The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 1,809,000) are depastured in all parts of the colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. As far north as Geraldton, the climate, and the tracts of good soil, are well adapted for nearly all English garden and orchard produce and cereals; and the vine, orange, fig, and other fruits of the south of Europe flourish luxuriantly. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

A great part of the forests of the south is heavy timber country. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. Some of these companies have constructed lines of railway of their own, as much as 20 miles in length, and carry on their operations on a considerable scale. But there is scope for a far larger industry. Sandalwood is still abundant, and is exported to Singapore and China. A species of Eucalyptus in the southern forests, known as the "Karri," attains a gigantic size and height (sometimes nearly 300 feet), and wide tracts of these great trees are now being worked, and their timber is reported to be equal to "Jarrah."

At Sharks Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounts to about 25,000l. per annum.

Lead and copper mines are worked in the Champion Bay district. The former are most productive, but the industry has been affected by the decline in the price of the ore. Some rich lodes of copper have been lately opened. Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley District, and several thousand diggers have been attracted to the fields, which were proclaimed and a warden appointed in June, 1886. The goldfields are 370 miles from the town of Derby in King's Sound, and about 220 miles from the town of Wyndham in Cambridge Gulf. The fields promise to be rich and extensive.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, and the Bank of New South Wales.

The total amount of their deposits on the 30th June, 1887, was 947,090l., and their note circulation 55,734l.

A Government Post Office saving bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863, and the deposits on the 1st July, 1887, amounted to 31,617l.

Education.

Government schools exist all over the colony, and are governed by district boards working under a central board. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act and are enforced.

Assisted schools by different denominations are also subsidised by the State. The amount expended on education for 1886 was 10,452l. A high school is also subsidised by the State. There is a high school for girls under the direction of the Anglican Bishop, and another conducted by the Sisters of Mercy.
In January, 1887, there were 78 Government schools in the colony, with 3,169 scholars, and 16 assisted schools, with 1,339, scholars; total 4,508.

Means of Communication.

The colony possesses at present two lines of Government railways: a line (110 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford or York and Beverley; and a line (84 miles) from Geraldton to Northamptom, in the Champion Bay Mining district, and 17 miles between Geraldton and Greenough. In addition to these, large schemes for the construction of several hundred miles of railways on the land grant method have been initiated and are in progress, as well as several branch and short lines amounting in all to about 62 miles. The total length open is 161 miles, and the receipts in 1886 were 37,652l., and the working expenses 35,439l. The total cost of construction has been 704,003l. Of electric telegraph at the end of 1886 there were 2,388 miles of poles, and 500 more miles in course of erection between Roebourne and Derby, besides which about 500 miles are about to be erected between Derby and Wyndham (Cambridge Gulf). The number of telegrams forwarded during 1886 was 165,613, and the revenue received 7,424l. There is telegraph communication with the world, via South Australia. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast.

There is a fortnightly mail by the P. and O. Company's contract mail steamers to and from the United Kingdom, with a mail to and from the other Australian colonies by them, and local steamers once a week or oftener. The rates of postage are:

| Australasia         | 2d.   | Free |
| Europe, United States | 6d. | 1d. |
| Eastern Colonies    | 2d.   | ½d. |

Fremantle is a port of registry, with a tonnage of 7,285 on 31st December, 1886.

Defence.

In August, 1887, the Volunteer force of the colony consisted of 590 of all ranks. Of this number 80 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is to be strongly fortified as a coaling station at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office.

Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They are very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement is very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are largely utilised as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule they are not hostile, though very troublesome when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The death-rate is extremely low. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The winter rains are neither bleak nor excessive.
