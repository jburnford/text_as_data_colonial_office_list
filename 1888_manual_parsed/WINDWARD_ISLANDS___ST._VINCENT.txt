ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land, of which only about 13,000 acres is in cultivation. Some of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from the mainland.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the bottom of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of 5,593 souls. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 31 vessels, of 768 tons.

St. Vincent, though exhibiting some features in common with the other islands, is favourably distinguished from many of them by an undulating surface, and a succession of gentle slopes, of which portions are cultivated for sugar-cane. Its most striking peculiarity is its "Soufrière," or volcanic mountain, celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and is about 3,000 feet above the level of the sea.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded mountain traverses it from north to south, sending off spurs on each side. The highest peak is Morne à Garou, 4,000 feet high. The streams are small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Kingston river.

Industry.

Sugar, rum, cocoa, spices, and excellent arrow-root are produced. A large proportion of the cultivated land is owned by one firm, and the negroes "squat" upon the unsurveyed and unoccupied Crown lands. The forests produce excellent woods.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands. The Caribs continued sole masters of St. Vincent until the year 1675, when a number of savages of a different race were discovered on it. These received the appellation of "Black Caribs," to distinguish them from the aborigines, to whom the name of "Yellow Caribs" was given.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £6,625l.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the Island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals.
By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but then the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overrun the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the Zebra sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British head-quarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Rattan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of Coolie labourers in 1861. There are about 2,000 of these immigrants at present located on different plantations in the island.

**Constitution**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor, and composed of three members, one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony; and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex-officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.

But this Constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act 39 and 40 Vic., c. 47), by which the future modelling of the Constitution was left to the Crown. By an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, the Legislative Council now consists of four official and four nominated unofficial members.

The several courts of the colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the colony is the sole Judge of this Court.
