GIBRALTAR.

Situation and Area.

The Rock of Gibraltar was captured by the British Forces on the 24th of July, 1704, and was formally ceded by Spain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The territory consists of an elevated promontory, running southwards. Its greatest elevation is 1,439 feet, its length is 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile. Its area is 1½ square miles.

General Description.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the straits. Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and coaling station by shipping, and it is also an entrepôt of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1886, 87 vessels, of together 7,388 tons. The total shipping entered and cleared in 1886 was 8,874,389 tons; 6,678,379 tons of it being British. No statistics of imports or exports are taken, but in 1885 the exports from England to Gibraltar were 715,482, and the imports 15,832l.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, duties upon wine, spirits, and beer, and a few licence duties.

The eastern face of the Rock is an inaccessible precipice. The larger portion of the town lies on the northern portion of the west slope of the Rock. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, but it is very healthy, and the drainage and water supply are good.

The two portions of the town are separated by a picturesque public garden, called the Alameda.

There is no Executive Council, nor any legislative body; the Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison, exercising by himself all the functions of government and legislation.

The customs tariff is as follows:

(Ordnance 9th Sept., 1884, and 1st July, 1886.)

| Posetas. | cents. |
|---------|--------|
| Wine in wood, per gall. | 0 | 40 |
| in bottles, per doz. | 1 | 25 |
| Spirits, per proof gall., and cordials or liqueurs, per gall. | 5 | 0 |
| Malt liquor, per gall. | 0 | 05 |

The total revenue from customs in 1885 was 11,187l.

Total Population (exclusive of Military) according to Census of 1881, 18,881.

There are no private banking establishments, but a Government savings bank was founded in 1882, and had on 31st December, 1886, 31,048l. deposited by 1,213 depositors.

There is daily postal communication with England by way of Spain and France: rates of postage, letters, 2½d. per oz., newspapers, 1d. The internal postage rate is 1d. per ¼ oz. There are also branch post offices at Tangier, Larache, Rabat, and Casablanca, Safi, Mazagan and Mogador in Morocco, and direct telegraphic communication with Spain, and by cable to Tangier, Malta, and Lisbon.

The legal tender currency is that of Spain, and accounts are usually kept in it: (1 peseta = 1 franc, approximately).

Education is not compulsory. There are fourteen elementary poor schools subsidised by Government, the number of scholars in attendance being 2,391. The schools are managed by the clergy of the different denominations, and small fees are charged.

THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Area.
The Gold Coast is the name generally given to a portion of Upper Guinea, between 5° W. long, and 2° E. long., between which points are the settlements of Newtown, Axim, Dixcove, Secondee, Elmina, Cape Coast Castle, Anamaboe, Accra, Addah, Quittah, Danae, and Aflowhoo. The length of coast line of the English colony is about 350 miles, and the total area of the British Protectorate from 24,000 to 30,000 square miles, including the districts of Appolonia, Wassaw, Denkera, Sefwhi, Akim, Croboe, Krikor, Crepee, and Aquamoo.

History.
French navigators are said to have discovered the Gold Coast in the fourteenth century. The Portuguese landed at Elmina in 1471. English, Dutch, and Portuguese factories were established in the seventeenth century.

In 1672 a company was formed, called the Royal African Company, which built forts at Dixcove, Secondee, Commendah, Anamaboe, Winnebah, and Accra, besides strengthening Cape Coast Castle, which was already in existence. It was succeeded in 1750 by the African Company of Merchants, constituted by Act of Parliament, with liberty to trade and to form establishments on the West Coast of Africa, between 20° N. and 20° S. lat. This company, which received an annual subsidy from the Government, suffered by the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, and was dissolved in 1821 by Act of Parliament, and the forts transferred to the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlements. The fort at Whydah was abandoned.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighboring country of the Fantis in possession of the victorious and marauding armies of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and himself led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Essankow, where on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowah, near Accra, in 1827. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831 between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government, had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government
subsidy of only 4,000l. a-year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his government over the whole tract of country lying behind the British forts, and now known as the Gold Coast Protectorate. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the Slave Trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, a Lieut.-Governor being appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of Native Affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847, when Mr. Fitzpatrick was appointed.

In 1850 the Danish forts at Accra, Fingo, Addah, and Quittah were purchased from the King of Denmark for 10,000l., the Danish Protectorate being at the same time transferred.

In 1852 a large meeting of the native chiefs (afterwards known as the "Legislative Assembly") agreed to pay a poll tax in exchange for British protection. This tax gradually fell in arrear and was abandoned, though some was received up to 1861.

Interspersed amongst the British settlements there had always been a number of Dutch forts. This circumstance was an abiding source of embarrassment to the British Government, as, the Dutch settlements being free ports, no appreciable customs duties could be imposed at the British ports without driving trade into those of the Dutch. A partition of the coast was therefore effected by a Convention, which came into force on the 1st of January, 1868, the Dutch taking the country west of the Sweet river, the British that lying to the east. Under this partition the Dutch acquired Dixcove, Apollonia, Secondee, and Commendah; the British acquired Dutch Accra, Berraco, Appam, Cormantyne, and Morce. Her Majesty also relinquished to the King of Holland her protectorate over the two Wassaws, Apollonia, and Denkera.

The Dutch found their new possessions extremely unruly. Their authority was defied by the protected tribes of the interior, and their officers outraged and ill-treated on the coast; and by a convention, signed at the Hague in 1871, they abandoned to Great Britain the whole of their rights on the coast. Before the Convention was ratified, an assurance was first sought and received from the King of Ashanti that he had no claim on the Dutch settlements of Elmina. The formidable objection to the transfer arising out of this supposed claim having been removed, the Ratifications were exchanged at the Hague in February, 1872, and on the 6th of April, 1872, the actual transfer of the sovereignty of the forts took place.*

On the 9th of December, 1872, the King of Ashanti despatched from Coomassie an army of 40,000 men to invade the British Protectorate. It is not clearly known what may have been the motives prompting him to this proceeding.

His army did not cross the Prah until the 29th of January, 1873. It then spread itself slowly over the country, ravaging as it advanced. In April it met and defeated the Fanti allies at Dunquah, and again in June at Jouguah.

This victory encouraged the commander to attack the fortress of Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the seamen and Marines of the Fleet, in conjunction with the Colonial Forces, all under the command of the late Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing, K.C.M.G., C.B. After this the war languished for some time, until the late Captain, afterwards Sir John Glover, G.C.M.G., was commissioned to repair to the eastern districts of the Protectorate, and organise the tribes in that quarter for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory.

At the same time Sir Garnet, now Viscount Wolseley, was despatched to the Gold Coast to concert other measures for bringing about the objects in view. The British troops arrived early in December, but a good road to the Prah not having been completed, they were sent to sea again. In the meantime Sir Garnet Wolseley by the aid of native levies, West Indian troops and seamen and Marines had been driving the enemy further and further towards the Prah, which they crossed on the 27th, 28th, and 29th of November. The white troops landed towards the end of December, and Sir Garnet Wolseley and his head-quarters crossed the Prah on the 20th of January. The King of Ashanti now begged for peace, and sent the captive missionaries and others to the British camp; but as his language and acts were not satisfactory, Sir Garnet Wolseley continued his advance, and on the 31st of January came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoafu, where, after desperate resistance, he drove them from their position. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Coomassie. The King had fled to the bush. Negotiations were opened with him, but without result, and on the 6th Sir Garnet Wolseley quitted Coomassie and commenced his march to the Coast, the Royal Engineers firing the city as the force marched out. In the meantime Sir John Glover had been advancing from the east with Houssas and native allies, and on the 12th he passed through the burning ruins of Coomassie. On the 13th messengers sent by the King signed a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fonmanah, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Coffee (who could not write). By the Treaty of Fonmanah the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, to keep up a good road to the Prah, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold to the Queen. He also asked that the Queen would permit him to send his son to be educated in England. This was allowed, and the boy (Kofi Inte) was placed at the Surrey County School, near Guildford; and after being in the service of the Government of Trinidad, has now returned to the Gold Coast, where he is allowed 120l. a year by the Government. Since then King Coffee Kari-Kari has been deposed and has died. He was succeeded by King Mensah, who, in his turn, was deposed in 1881.

After an interregnum of about two years, during which period much trouble and disturbance of trade was occasioned through intrigues designed to replace Kari-Kari upon "The Stool." Quacoe Duah was elected king in April, 1884, and peaceful results followed; but Quacoe Duah died of smallpox in June, 1884, and up to the time of going to press there is no king of Ashanti.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the British Government of the Gold Coast upon a proper footing of efficiency and security.
A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by letters patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument the Gold Coast is defined as including all British settlements between 5° West longitude and 2° East longitude, and provision is made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Two unofficial members have been appointed to the Legislative Council.

By an Order in Council, dated the 6th of August, 1874, Her Majesty empowered the Legislature to regulate by Ordinance or Ordinances all such powers as she may enjoy in the protected territories adjacent to the British settlements.

The Supreme Court of the Colony is a Court of Appeal for Lagos, and also under the West African Order in Council, 1884. Legislation providing for the establishment of separate courts of appeal in either colony is in course of preparation.

Climate

The climate is unhealthy for the continued residence of Europeans, although yellow fever is unknown. The mean temperature is 82° F. in shade, the extreme range being from 68° to 87° in shade. The annual rainfall is about 60 inches, the rainy seasons being from March to July, and September and October, the latter being succeeded by the cool dry Harmattan from November to February. Dampness is the prevailing characteristic.

Domestic Slavery.

At its first meeting, the Legislative Council, exercising the powers in relation to the Protectorate conferred by Her Majesty's Order in Council of the 6th of August, 1874, passed two ordinances disposing of the question of slavery.

Domestic slavery existed from time immemorial on the Gold Coast, as in other parts of Africa. The slave population consisted partly of native-born slaves, and partly of Donkos, slaves purchased from Ashanti importers. Slavery was an emanation of parental authority, every man being saleable either by his father or mother, according to the character of the union subsisting between his parents, and the consequent status of the mother. In addition to slavery emanating from parental authority, there was a species of slavery called pawning, founded on contract, which arose when a debtor gave to his creditor, as a security, either himself, or a child or slave, to be a temporary slave in the hands of the creditor until debt and interest were paid.

Within the British possessions on the Gold Coast, slavery was abolished by force of the statute 3 & 4 Will. iv., c. 73, but the Protectorate was not affected by that statute. Nor was any attempt made on the part of the British Government to uphold it from the Protectorate. "If the laws or usages of those countries," observed Lord John Russell (desp. 14 July, 1841) "tolerate slavery, we have no right to set aside those laws or usages except by persuasion, negotiation, and other peaceful means." But even at that time the harsher usages of slavery were appreciably mitigated by the action of the court of the "judicial assessor to the Native Chiefs" and other magistrates. At the conclusion of the war of 1873-4 the question was taken in hand anew, and settled by the two ordinances above mentioned. One prohibits, under penalties, the introduction of slaves into the Protectorate, and the buying and selling, and pawning of slaves and other persons within the Protectorate; and the second declares, that henceforth no court, native or British, shall take notice of, so as to give effect to, the relations between master and slave, except in so far as those relations may be in accordance with the law of England relating to master and servant.

Means of Communication.

Some four or five steamers of the "British and African," and "African Steamship" Companies leave Liverpool every month for the Gold Coast and other ports. Monthly steamers of the Woerman Line leave Hamburg also for the Gold Coast. The Colony has entered the Postal Union, and a Post Office Money Order system is established with the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone. The parcels post is now in operation to Accra, Cape Coast Castle, and Quittah.

Lagos to Cape Coast is . . . . . . . . . . 315
Cape Coast to Sierra Leone . . . . . . . . 913
Sierra Leone to Madeira . . . . . . . . . . 1,580
Madeira to England (Liverpool). . . . . . . 1,426

The length of voyage from Liverpool to Madeira is about 7 days; and from Madeira to Cape Coast about 14 days.

There is no railway in the colony, and, except in and near the towns, hardly any roads. The paths through the bush are kept free from the overgrowing vegetation by the native chiefs, who receive small presents for this service.

There is a fairly good road from Cape Coast to Prahsue (75 miles), made by the troops in 1874, and another between Accra and Aburi, the Government Sanatorium, with paths thence to Akpong and Odumassie.

The principal water route is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and falls into the sea at Addah, after a course of 200 miles. It is however not usually navigable for more than 60 miles, and only for small boats. The Ancobra River is also navigable for boats for about 50 miles. The Prah is almost useless.

There is no harbour along the whole coast of the colony, and goods and passengers must everywhere be landed in surf-boats through what is often a dangerous surf.

A telegraph line has been erected between Accra, Christiansborg, and Aburi, and between Accra Cape Coast and Elmina, altogether a distance of 119 miles. Accra is in telegraphic communication with England, via Sierra Leone, Bathurst, and St. Vincent, and also with Grand Bassam on the West, and with Lagos, the Niger, and with Cootenoo and the Portuguese and French Settlements to the South, viz., St. Thomas, Principe, St. Paul de Leando, and Gaboon, there being altogether four cables.

Education

There are Government elementary schools at Accra and Cape Coast, but education is chiefly in the hands of the Wesleyan ministers, the Roman Catholic Missions, and the German Mission Society. The Wesleyans have about 2,500 scholars in their schools, which are spread over the Colony,
and they spend annually about £1,000l. on education, to which the Government has hitherto contributed £200l. The Basle Mission Society has about 2,200 scholars in 60 schools, scattered over the eastern parts of the Colony, and their annual expenditure on education exceeds £4,000l., to which the Government contribution has been £150l., in addition to £75l. to the Bremen Mission at Quittah. English is being taught in these schools, chiefly in the higher classes, and the Basle Mission Society also teaches handicrafts and agriculture. A system of grants based on results is being introduced. The total number of children at school is about 5,000.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling, with Spanish, American, and French gold coins, and gold dust at £3 12s. 0d. per oz. Some Mexican and other dollars and silver of the Latin Union are also current, but are not legal tender. Dutch silver still passes in the Western Province, and cowries (40 = 1d.) among the natives of the eastern Districts. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are no banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank will shortly be established.

Population.

No census has ever been taken, but it is estimated that the whole Colony and Protectorate now includes 1,000,000 inhabitants, of whom not more than 100 are Europeans. The chief towns are, Accra (15,000); Addah (7,000); Elmina (6,000); Cape Coast Castle (5,000); and Quittah.

Trade and Industry.

The staple products of the Colony are palm oil and palm kernels. The palm does not grow near the coast, and the produce is brought down on the heads of carriers from an area extending forty miles inland, and by canoe down the Volta River from a greater distance. Gold is found in many parts, notably in the Wassaw district, in the north-west, of which Tarquah is the centre. The distance from the nearest port (Axim), and the lack of a good road, have proved obstacles to successful gold mining on a large scale, but the natives collect the alluvial gold for export in considerable quantities, 74,829l. having been exported in 1886. India-rubber abounds in the interior forests, and is rapidly becoming an important export. Cotton grows wild, but is not cultivated. Small quantities of coffee and ground nuts are grown, and the exports also include monkey skins, ivory, copra, guinea grains, gum copal, camwood, and beni-seed. The trade with Salagha and Ashanti is slight, owing to the difficulties of communication and the frequent native wars. Fishing is extensively carried on. There are but few manufactures, and these on the smallest scale. Native cloth is woven, fish is salted and cured, bricks are made, and simple boats built. Gold is worked into native ornaments with great skill. The chief imports are textiles, alcohol, hardware, and cooperage.
