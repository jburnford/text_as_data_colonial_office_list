FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long.; they consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles. Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roche in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883.

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1768 they were taken possession of by France; subsequently, they were held by the Spaniards until 1771, when they were for a time abandoned, and the sovereignty of them given up to Great Britain.

In 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 725. There is a small hamlet at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 7 vessels, of a total tonnage of 928 tons. It has a fine inner and an outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going round Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 189 pupils, and 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 80 pupils.

The climate is healthy. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. In winter the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. The whole is equable. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

There is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to the height of seven...
oct. with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast the tussock grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, sourvy grass, sorrel, &c., besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos.

The sole industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to South America. A frozen meat company imports dead meat to Europe.

The other exports consists of wool, hides horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no banks in the colony, and no Government savings bank has yet been established.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 108,684 acres leased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is 100,000l., of which 95,000l. is paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in these islands by Mr. F. E. Cobb, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin. The London office is at 39A, Gracechurch Street, E.C.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England twelvetimes a year. In June, 1880, a contract was entered into between the Government and the German "Kosmos" Steampship Company, to perform the service. The steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao, six times a year, and six times on the return voyage. The voyage between Stanley and Dartmouth occupies five weeks. Mails for the Falkland Islands are also carried by the Pacific Company's Steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, where they are taken by the Kosmos Steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to Europe 4d. per ½ oz.; there is no internal post. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet.
