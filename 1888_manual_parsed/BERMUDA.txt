BERMUDA.

Situation and Area.

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group or cluster of about 300 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 32° 15' N., and long. 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American Continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730, from New York 677, and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles. The total area is estimated at 18 square miles.

History.

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudes, after whom they were called The Bermudas. The Spaniards however took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers' ship, "The Sea Venture," while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the Admiral's ship, The Sea Venture Flat.

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudes, called the group after him, "The Somers' Islands." The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land, taken home by Somers' nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their Charter, so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I; but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of 2,000l. to a new body of adventurers, called "The Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers' Islands," and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the Admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers.

General Description.

The Bermudas may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sand hills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 10 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern, and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. Not more than one hundred of them deserve the name of islands, the others are mere rocks: even of the one hundred enumerated not more than fifteen or sixteen are inhabited, the remainder being of inconsiderable size. The largest island, generally known as The Main Island, is about fourteen miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands taken together measure about 3,000 acres. The town of Hamilton, now the seat of Government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the small vessels which suffice to carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the
transfer of the seat of Government to Hamilton, is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, standing by itself in the centre of the inland waters, and entirely given up for the accommodation of Her Majesty's Dockyard and a number of other naval establishments. Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, are now exclusively occupied by military depots and garrisons; Somerset, Smith's, St. David's, Cooper's, Nonsuch, Rivers, Forts, and Godets, are all inhabited by a civil population. The islands form an almost continuous chain: and with the exception of one break between Somerset and Watford Islands, there is uninterrupted communication by roads and bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset—Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island—a distance of about 22 miles.

Nearly half the inhabitants are of English descent, the remainder belonging to the negro race. English is universally spoken.

The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The annual rainfall is about 60 inches. There is no winter, the thermometer never falling below 40 deg. of Fahr., and the summers are never very hot, the thermometer rarely rising above 85 deg. The summer heat too is generally tempered by a pleasant sea breeze.

Trade and Agriculture.

In former days the inhabitants of Bermuda gave themselves up almost entirely to maritime pursuits. Numerous small vessels, of from 200 to 300 tons burden, built by the islanders themselves, of their native cedar, traded between the West Indies and Demerara, and the United States, and the British colonies of North America. Later they extended their voyages, carrying the salt fish of Newfoundland to Italy and Portugal, and taking back the Port wine for which Newfoundland became celebrated, or running down to Madeira or Ascension to meet the homeward bound Indian fleet, and taking back cargoes of tea or other Indian and Chinese products to be distributed along the American seaboard.

But the repeal of the British navigation laws, the introduction of steam, and the very general substitution of iron for wooden ships, gradually destroyed the carrying trade which had been so profitable to Bermuda, and now the little maritime fleet may be said to have ceased to exist, and the industry of the islanders is entirely confined to turning to account the small quantity of agricultural land which they possess. Hamilton is however still a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1886, 24 vessels, of 3,667 tons.

The soil of Bermuda may be described generally as being poor in quality. Of the 12,000 acres comprised in the whole group, not more than 1,000 acres can be said to consist of good or fertile soil, and at least 9,000 acres can never repay the expense of cultivation, consisting as they do of very hilly and stony ground, partially covered with a scanty herbage and a scattered growth of stunted cedar trees, or of widespread brackish marshes overgrown with coarse grass, rushes and mangrove jungle.

But the climate combined with the geographical position of these islands, in some measure compensates for the smallness of the area of fertile ground. There being nothing to fear from winter frosts, the ground can be sown and planted at any time from the end of August to the end of March, and the crops can be gathered and shipped off to New York in the mouths of March, April, May, and June, when the corresponding American produce has as yet scarcely shown itself above ground, and the Bermudians, taking advantage of this peculiarity of their climate, raise large crops of early potatoes, onions, tomatoes and beetroot, with which they keep the New York market supplied at a time when those vegetables cannot be obtained from any other quarter.

Very little use is made of the soil in Bermuda after the spring crops have been grown; a few melons, pumpkins, or sweet potatoes may be raised here and there, but by far the greater part of the ground is allowed to remain idle during the hot summer months; anything that could then be grown in Bermuda can be imported so much more cheaply from America, that it never pays a Bermudian agriculturist to produce it. Very little also of the spring produce of the islands is consumed by the inhabitants: it is too costly; nearly all the early vegetables raised in Bermuda are exported, and the whole population, civil and military, depends for its subsistence upon food supplies obtained from abroad. All the bread and meat, and nearly all the vegetables consumed in the islands, are imported from New York, and all the food, furniture, clothing, horses, and cattle are brought from that or other quarters. Of late years the Islands of Bermuda have become a favourite winter resort for Americans and Canadians seeking to escape the rigours of the climate of the continent. Large hotels have sprung up, and a considerable amount of money is expended by the visitors.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender, and some Spanish and Mexican gold doubloons. A branch of the Merchants Bank of Halifax has been recently established at Hamilton. Messrs. N. T. Butterfield and Son have also a banking establishment at Hamilton, and several of the leading merchants do a considerable amount of business as private bankers and agents. A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and there are branches at Hamilton, St. George's, and Sandy's Parish. The number of depositors at the end of 1886 was 548; the total amount of deposits 10,556l.

Education.

In 1839 the Colonial Legislature first granted a sum of money to aid elementary schools.

The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of the Governor and eight other members appointed by the Executive under the provisions of the Schools Act, 1879.

The local management is nominally in the hands of each parish vestry, which constitutes under the last named Act a local board of education.

All the schools are private schools, charging fees. Attendance is compulsory, and there were in 1885 23 schools, with 1,293 scholars.

Mail Service and Postage.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Cape Hatteras, but messages are usually sent via New York.

There is a regular fortnightly mail service with New York, and a weekly service during the early spring. There is no direct service with England.

Internal Communications.

There are no railways in the Colony. There are 94 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads. The telegraphs are worked by the military authorities, and comprise 15 miles of cable and 32 miles of land line. The total cost of construction was £3,549., the receipts in 1886 were £140., and the expenditure was £408.

Government and Constitution.

Representative government was introduced into the colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermudian Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the Governors have always been appointed by the Crown, and the laws of the colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council, and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by a Privy Council, consisting at present of nine members named by the Crown, the same nine members constituting the Legislative Council. The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 983 electors, the electoral qualifications being the possession of freehold property of not less than £6l. value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property rated at £240l.

The Naval Station.

The importance of the Bermudas as a naval station began to be felt towards the end of the last century, during the wars which we had to wage first with the revolted provinces in America, and afterwards with the French and Spaniards.

The position of the islands, situated in mid-ocean, at almost equal distances from the West Indies, the eastern seaboard of the United States, and the Dominion of Canada, including our great naval station at Halifax, presents many advantages for the establishment of a Naval Station in the Western Atlantic, and the peculiar conformation of the group affords special facilities for the creation of a naval depot and fortress of the first class. A broad and almost continuous barrier, formed of a succession of islands and sunken coral reefs, and measuring about 50 miles in circuit, encloses an internal oval area of about 120 square miles of water, access to which from the outer ocean can only be gained through a few long narrow tortuous channels in which are interspersed not a few clusters of sunken coral rocks. Ireland Island—which contains Her Majesty's dockyard and the other naval establishments—occupies a central position in the midst of this enclosed sea.

The principal channel through the outer reefs, the only one that is now used by merchant vessels, and the only one that is safe for large ships, is that which is called "The Narrows," which sweeps round the northern and eastern sides of St. George's Island, at a distance of about half-a-mile from the shore. This channel is about two miles in length, and is very narrow and intricate, so that vessels must move through it very slowly and with great caution. It is commanded throughout its whole length, as are also the approaches to it from either side, by numerous batteries mounting very heavy guns behind casemated iron shields.

BRITISH BECHUANALAND,

AND THE BRITISH PROTECTORATE OVER BECHUANALAND AND THE KALAHARI DISTRICT.

Situation and Area.
British Bechuanaland is bounded on the east by the South African Republic, on the south by the Cape Colony, on the west by the Molopo River, and on the north by the said Molopo River to its junction with the Ramathlaboma Spruit and thence by the said Spruit to the frontier of the South African Republic.

The Protectorate over Bechuanaland and the Kalahari extends westward to the 20th meridian of east longitude, and northward to the 22nd parallel of south latitude. The total area of the whole district is about 162,000 square miles.

History.
As a consequence of the Convention of London concluded on the 27th February, 1884, between Her Majesty and the South African Republic, it was decided by Her Majesty's Government to establish a protectorate in Bechuanaland, with the special object of protecting two chiefs named Mankaroane (chief of the Batlapins), and Montsion (chief of the Barlongs), whose misfortunes had excited much sympathy in this country, and who were believed to have established special claims upon the gratitude of Great Britain. The cases of the chiefs were very similar. Mankaroane had a rival named Massouw, who was supported by certain Boers; whilst Montsion had a rival, similarly supported, named Moshteta. In each case the native supported by the Boers had been victorious in the hostilities which had taken place, and in the peace agreements which followed it was provided that the European volunteers should receive grants of land chiefly out of the former possession of the defeated chiefs. The allies of Massouw had constituted themselves into a Republic styled...
Stellaland, and the allies of Moshette into one styled Land Goosen, or the Land of Goshen. The Stellalanders succeeded to a great extent in occupying the lands thus carved out for them, and in organising a government. The Goshenites had not been so successful, and hostilities between them and Montsioa were still proceeding. In pursuance of the resolution to establish a protectorate, Mr. John Mackenzie, who had long lived with Mankaroane as a missionary, was appointed Deputy to the High Commissioner for Bechuanaland, and proceeded to Mankaroane's town of Taungs, where, on the 3rd May, 1884, he accepted from that chief on behalf of the Queen, a cession of his rights of government, and on reaching Vryburg, the capital of Stellaland, on the 12th May, he entered into negotiations with certain persons whom he believed to represent the white inhabitants at large, but no agreement was concluded. He then proceeded to Mafeking, where, on the 22nd May, he negotiated a treaty with Montsioa similar to that obtained from Mankaroane. On his way back he visited the western chiefs and obtained treaties from them. All this time a police force had been in course of organisation at Kimberley and Taungs, but the work proceeded slowly, chiefly from the difficulty of obtaining good horses; and there were no men available to keep the peace between Montsioa and the Goshenites. On the 12th May, that is a few days before Mr. Mackenzie's arrival at Mafeking, Mr. Bethell, a white adviser of Montsioa, had led the tribe to burn part of the Goshenites' town, and although there appear to have been no reprisals during Mr. Mackenzie's brief stay, the Goshenites had determined to renew hostilities, and in June proceeded to make forays on Montsioa's cattle and crops, and to seek to bring on a general engagement. This they succeeded in doing on the 31st July, when Montsioa's forces were completely routed, 100 tribesmen being killed, and also Mr. Bethell and a Mr. Walker, two of Montsioa's white friends. The Goshenites thus obtained for the first time possession of the lands which they had long been watching an opportunity to seize; whilst Montsioa had to take refuge in his stockade at Mafeking. At this point the South African Republic intervened; Commandant-General Joubert, who had been sent to meet Mr. Rhodes, who was appointed to act as Deputy Commissioner on the resignation of Mr. Mackenzie, brought about a so-called peace and settlement of the country, which included the destruction of Montsioa's laager and the absorption of all his country by the freebooters, except ten farms, or say about 60,000 acres. This agreement was immediately repudiated by Mr. Rhodes, and was never recognised in any way. Montsioa was also induced to offer to place himself and his tribe under the South African Republic; and the President, with the assent of the Volksraad, issued a proclamation, dated the 16th September, taking Montsioa, and also Moshette, under the protection of the Republic, subject to the approval of Her Majesty the Queen, under Article IV. of the Convention of London.

Her Majesty's Government, in a telegram of the 7th October, disapproved the proclamation, and called on the South African Republic to annul it; which was done by another proclamation of the 13th of that month. At the same time the Government decided to take steps to extricate Montsioa from the state in which he had been left by the attacks of the freebooters. For this purpose arrangements were made for collecting and despatching to Bechuanaland a force of about 4,000 men of all arms, including 2,000 irregular cavalry. The force was placed under the immediate command of Sir Charles Warren, R.E. (now G.C.M.G.), with the local military rank of Major-General, and having also a civil commission as Special Commissioner for Bechuanaland. Whilst the military preparations were proceeding the Cape Premier and the Treasurer visited the country with a view of arranging a peaceful settlement. On the 22nd November, 1884 these gentlemen concluded an arrangement with the Goshenites, the details of which need not be given, as they were regarded by Her Majesty's Government as unsatisfactory, and Sir Charles Warren was consequently directed to proceed and occupy the country, which he did without meeting with any armed opposition. He remained in military occupation of the country until August, 1885, completely restoring tranquillity, and engaging in many useful labours for the permanent pacification of the country. These labours included the marking off of the Transvaal and Bechuanaland boundary, as laid down by the London Convention of 1884, and visiting the chiefs of Northern Bechuanaland, Gasaitswe, Sechele, and Khamo, over whom Her Majesty's Government had declared a protectorate in March, 1885.

To return to the affairs of the settlers in Stellaland, it may be mentioned that after leaving Montsioa at the end of May, Mr. Mackenzie arrived at a settlement of the affairs of Stellaland with some of the persons with whom he had previously been treating, which involved a recognition to a great extent of the land claims of the Stellalanders, and of the money obligations of the Stellaland Government, and the assumption by the British Government of the administration of the country. This settlement was finally concluded on the 4th July. In August Mr. Mackenzie was recalled to Cape Town by Sir Hercules Robinson, and whilst there, in view of the disfavour with which his appointment and proceedings were regarded by the Cape Ministry, he, on the 19th August, tendered his resignation.

In the meantime Mr. Rhodes had been sent to replace him in Bechuanaland, assisted by Commander Graham Bower, R.N., Sir Hercules Robinson's secretary. These gentlemen arrived at an agreement with the Stellalanders on the 8th September, rescinding Mr. Mackenzie's arrangement of the affairs of Stellaland, and restoring the temporary administration of its affairs to the white inhabitants, under the supervision of the British Government pending a final settlement of affairs and the annexation of Bechuanaland to the Cape Colony, which was the end generally kept in view by all parties. Sir Charles Warren and the Bestuur, or Council, which existed in Stellaland during his presence in the country, were opposed to the Rhodes agreement on technical and general grounds, into which it is unnecessary to enter, as the whole land question in British Bechuanaland was relegated to a judicial commission consisting of the present administrator, Sir Sidney Shippard, and two officers.

On the 30th September, 1885, the territory south of the Molopo River and of the Ramathlabama Spruit was declared to be British territory under the name of British Bechuanaland. A commission was issued to the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope to be its governor, with power to legislate by proclamation, and the actual duties of administrator were entrusted to Mr. (now Sir) Sidney Shippard, formerly attorney-general of Griqualand West, and subsequently a judge in the Cape Colony.
Sir Charles Warren's force having been withdrawn, a mounted police force was formed for service in British Bechuanaland, and also to patrol and protect the country of the three protected chiefs of Northern Bechuanaland already mentioned, Gasitsive, Sechele, and Khama.

Climate, Water Supply, &c.

The climate of Bechuanaland is remarkably healthy. The dryness of the atmosphere neutralises to a great extent the effects of the heat in summer, while in winter the days are bright and tolerably warm, though between sunset and sunrise the cold is often intense owing to the elevation of the country, which may be roughly stated to vary from 4,000 to 4,500 feet above sea-level. The annual rainfall is about 25 inches. During the rainy season in the autumnal months the rainfall is often very considerable, and many parts present for a time the appearance of extensive marshes, but the water soon disappears, and in summer most of the rivers or torrent-beds are dry. The Molopo generally flows in winter; excellent water is however easily procurable at all times by digging in or near the river beds and by sinking wells in any part of the country. Thunderstorms are frequent in the summer, and dust storms from August to November.

The rate of mortality is low. Horse sickness is prevalent from December to May, and disappears when frost first sets in. Horses however become acclimatised, and with due precautions there is reason to believe that horse sickness may eventually disappear.

Industries.

The chief industry is agriculture, the products being raised for local consumption.

The country is well adapted for the breeding and fattening of cattle. The soil is excellent, especially to the north of the Setlagoli River, and with irrigation and slight culture will produce abundant crops. The black soil of Rooigrond is of great fertility. Maize, or "meaties," and Kafir corn are produced in abundance, and also vegetables of all kinds. Acacias and thorn trees abound north of Setlagoli. Well sinking and windmill pumps are found adequate to secure the requisite irrigation. Among natural products the wild indigo is especially remarkable from the excellence of the dye. Cotton also grows wild. Tobacco is being cultivated.

Gold has been discovered near Pitsanlo, in the neighbourhood of Mafeking, on the Setlagoli and Maritsani Rivers, and also near Vryburg and Taungs. Some of the specimens of quartz produced are rich, and small nuggets have been found on the Maritsani. Lead, silver, coal, and iron have also been found.

As there is no customs establishment, the value of the external trade cannot be given. The imports, which nearly all come from the Cape Colony, consist of textiles, hardware, and alcohol. The exports, nearly all for the Kimberley market, consist of mealies, wool, hides, cattle, and wood.

Means of Communication.

There is a fairly good road from Barkly West to Taungs, and thence there are two routes to Vryburg, the chief town of Stellaland. In order to escape the imposts on waggons levied by the South African Republic, a loop road for waggons has lately been made in British Territory so as to avoid Kunana. In addition to these routes three is the western road from Kuruman to Pitsanlo. From Mafeking excellent roads branch out in all directions. Shoshong and the country to the north up to the Zambesi may be reached either by the direct route from Molopole, which however is badly watered, or by the Notwani and Limpopo or Crocodile Rivers. Mafeking is the emporium of the trade with the interior, and is at present mainly supplied with merchandise brought from Delagoa Bay and Natal in Transvaal waggons.

The temporary military line of telegraph left by Sir Charles Warren has been replaced by a permanent line, extending from Barkly West to Mafeking, a distance of more than 200 miles, which is thus in telegraphic communication with all parts of the world.

There is a weekly post with Cape Town and all parts of the Cape Colony. The mail leaving Cape Town on Friday reaches Mafeking on the following Tuesday. Letters posted in Mafeking in time for the mail on Friday morning reach Cape Town in good time for the out-going English mail steamer on the following Wednesday. There is also a post between Kuruman and Taung, and by private arrangement letters can be sent fortnightly to Kanya, Molopole and Shoshong.

Churches and Education.

British Bechuanaland forms part of the Anglican Diocese of Bloemfontein, and is within the circuit of the Rural Dean of Griqualand West. There are clergymen at Vryburg, at Phoquane, and at Mafeking.

At Vryburg two schools for young children have already been opened. There is also a school at Mafeking.

The London Missionary Society maintains a fine educational establishment for natives at Kuruman, and has missionaries at that place, Taungs, Kanya, Molopole, Shoshong, and elsewhere.

The Wesleyan Mission has been long established at Mafeking and elsewhere. There is a large Wesleyan native church and a European chapel at Mafeking, and one at Vryburg.

Hospitals.

There are small gaol hospitals at Mafeking, Vryburg, and Taungs. At Mafeking a good military hospital has been built by the troopers of the Bechuanaland Police Force.

Currency and Banking.

Up to the present time no bank has been established, and the want of banking facilities is a subject of much complaint on the part of the traders and farmers. There is as yet no Govern-
ment savings bank. The currency is exclusively British sterling.

**Townships.**

Vryburg is the principal town, but the headquarters of government is at present Mafeking, in the neighbourhood of the native village of the same name, where substantial public and private buildings of stone and burnt brick with galvanised iron roofs have sprung up. The market is well supplied from the Transvaal farmers, who bring in produce from the Marico District. Some opposition was feared from Montsios and his people on account of the proximity of a European town, but the chief (who like Mankoroane receives an annuity of 300l. from her Majesty's Government) seems now satisfied with existing arrangements.

**The British Protectorate.**

Patrols of the Bechuanaland Border Police visit the various districts from time to time. A detachment is at present stationed at Shoshong, where the chief Khama is apprehensive of attacks from other chiefs. An Assistant Commissioner has been appointed, who now resides at Kanya.

With regard to the Kalahari—much of which is a fine, well-watered, and productive country—little has been done beyond establishing a good understanding with the chief Boreki at Honing Vlei. Toto, chief of the Batlasos of the Laungberg, is loyal, and his people are well behaved. It is proposed to establish a new European township close to the Kuruman Fountain above the land of the London Missionary Society. Farms are being occupied on the north bank of the large river west of Khei, and a European settlement there may result in the opening up of the whole Kalahari to white enterprise.

**The Land Commission of British Bechuanaland.**

The land settlement of British Bechuanaland effected by the Commission has been eminently satisfactory. Ample provision has been made for all the native requirements. Stellaland is finally settled and has now a farming population. All valid European claims in the Batlapin country have been satisfied, and the remaining extent of land will eventually be disposed of for public purposes.

**Surveys.**

Extensive surveys of Native Reserves and Crown lands have been authorised in connection with main triangulation of British Bechuanaland. The Transvaal Border is also being surveyed by a joint Commission, a measure rendered necessary by the circumstance that the boundary line is a road liable to deviations, and at first very insufficiently defined by landmarks at long intervals.

**The Bechuanaland Border Police.**

Colonel (now Sir F.) Carrington, K.C.M.G., raised this useful force while the army of Sir Charles Warren was leaving South Africa, and picked men from other Corps were enrolled, but the force has been chiefly recruited from the young farmers of the Eastern Districts of the Cape Colony, especially from Lower Albany. They are well disciplined, and their uniform and equipments are adapted for the requirements of their service, which are very varied. They have erected fortifications and built their own barracks at Mafeking, Vryburg, and Taungs; they sink wells, and perform countless duties beyond the scope of ordinary troops or police. They are trained both as cavalry soldiers, and to act on occasion as infantry or artillery in connection with the six field guns belonging to the Colony.
