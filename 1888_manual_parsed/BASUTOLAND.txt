BASUTOLAND.

Situation and Area.

Basutoland forms an irregular oval in the north-east of the Cape Colony; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State, Natal, and the Cape Colony form its boundaries. Its area is estimated at 10,293 square miles.

It lies between 29 and 30 degrees South Lat., and between 27 and 28 degrees East Long.

Description.

The territory, which is well watered, and enjoys a delicious climate, is the finest grain producing country in South Africa, and the abundant grass enables the Basutos to rear immense herds of cattle. The scenery is grand, and in many parts extremely beautiful.

The Maluti Mountains, forming a part of the great Drakensberg chain, occupy most of the country, which is really one continuous elevated plateau, though broken and rugged. The extension of arable culture has tended to drive the cattle more and more into the high grounds.

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of 600, of whom 30 are Europeans.

Population and Industry.

The following statistics are derived from the 1875 census of the Cape Colony, of which Basutoland then formed a part.

Population—European, 469
Native 127,707

Stock, etc.—35,257 horses, draught cattle 28,626, other 185,791, sheep, wooled, 240,270, other 49,537, goats, angora, 13,592, other 147,162, pigs 15,237, ploughs 2,770, harrows 269.

In the last ten years the native population has probably increased over 30 per cent., and now numbers about 175,000. As European settlement is prohibited, the white population will remain more or less limited to the few engaged in trade, Government, and Missionary work.

Its productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal has been found and is used in some parts, two mines being actively worked for local supply.

History.

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Moselikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the present century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Mosesh, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1852 war broke out between Mosesh and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Mosesh sent in his submission, and made peace.

A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Mosesh and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted. The conflict lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indecisive results, and was concluded by the Treaty of Aliwal, 1858. Even then peace was not established on any firm basis, outbreaks of hostilities frequently occurring.

In December, 1861, Mosesh invoked the protection of the Queen, and prayed to be recognised as a sort of tributary chief. He likewise prayed for the appointment of a British Resident, and grounded his petition on the treaty concluded with Sir George Cathcart after the action of the Berea. This request received due attention from the Colonial Office, but the arrangement fell through, owing to difficulties raised by the Orange Free State.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Mosesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. The latter declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner, Mr. J. Burnett, to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, with a view to settling difficulties. This measure met with little success, and the war continued.

The war dragged for some time; but in the end the Boers were everywhere successful, and Mosesh, under the pressure of reverses, and in face of prospective famine, sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1868, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Mosesh and his tribe as British subjects, and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated 12th March, 1868.

Though further danger from the Boers was thus averted, the country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape in August, 1871.

This was effected by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. In consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the Basuto community, the Act of Incorporation expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be subject to the general law of the Colony, that the Government should have power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The recent history of Basutoland has been one of much trouble and disturbance.

In March, 1879, Moirost, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year, his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault. The proposals of the Colonial Govern-
ment to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. Basutoland, they said, was already too small for its population, and the scheme of the Colonial Government was a breach of the promise which Sir P. Wodehouse made to Mosesh when the Basutos came under British rule, that Basutoland should always remain a native reserve. This discontent was further increased by the extension of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by Proclamation dated the 6th of April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force. The rebellion subsequently spread to the native territories to the east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tsaambokieland, and the country of the Pondomisi, where the rising was signalized by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hope, the magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success. The loss of their cattle, however, and the interruption of cultivation caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal by the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award was accepted by the Basutos and the fine paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. Finding that a full compliance with the award was not to be hoped for, the Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyalists. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and at a Pitso held on the 24th of April, 1883, a very liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Berea district, who was the leader of the revolt, and though he had accepted the award had taken no steps to comply with it, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connexion with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and the Colonial Ministry feeling themselves unable to effect a settlement, sent Mr. Merriman, the Minister for Public Works, to England to confer with Her Majesty's Government as to the future of the territory. In view of the disastrous effects which the abandonment would have produced, not only in Basutoland itself, but throughout South Africa, the Imperial Government decided to undertake provisionally and for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Gcaleka, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of 20,000l. a-year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A great national Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe. These unanimously expressed their desire to remain under British rule, and their willingness to pay hut tax and comply with the other conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were sufficiently complied with, advised the Queen to sanction the Dis-annexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The Chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Courts, where all cases between European and natives are brought.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into six districts, namely, Maseru, Leribe, Cornet Spruit, Berea, Mafeteng, and Quithing. Each of the districts is sub-divided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Mosesh family. The revenue arises from the Cape contribution, the post office, native hut-tax, and the sale of licences.

The latest reports describe a great improvement in the state of the country. Law and order have been restored, serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the Basuto people, are said to have been abandoned owing to the influence of the leading chiefs, the Missionaries, and the Government. There is now not a single canteen in the country. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by Missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 81 schools, with 3,662 scholars, nine-tenths being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are two small Government schools, and grants in aid of the others are made to the extent of 2,000l.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being mere brooks, occasionally flooded by mountain torrents. The usual mode of conveyance is by ox-wagon or light cart.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. There are no railways or telegraphs in the country.
The line of postal communication is through the Cape Colony and Orange Free State. There is a weekly mail service by carts, and letters to and from Europe take about 26 days, to Cape Town 6 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Cape Colony, viz., internal 2d., foreign 6d. The parcels post and money order systems have been extended to Basutoland. The nearest telegraph station is Ladybrand, Orange Free State, whence there is direct communication with Cape Town.

Trade.

In consequence of the hitherto unsettled state of the country, and the general depression of trade in South Africa, it has not been found practicable to gather any reliable statistics of exports. It has been roughly estimated that English goods were imported during 1886 to the value of about 200,000l., consisting chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries.

The exports, consisting chiefly of grain, cattle, skins, and wools, may have valued over 100,000l. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Colony.

Currency and Banking.

There are no banks in the Territory, and no Government savings bank has yet been established. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and even the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.
