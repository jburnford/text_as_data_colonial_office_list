CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is washed by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, on the northeast by the Orange Free State and Natal, and on the east by Pondoland. The Cape Colony with the Transkei contains an area of 213,636 square miles. It extends from 28 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland, with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Nomans Land were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walwick Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the colony by proclamation dated 7th Aug., 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekialand, of which by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. By Proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayllif") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887).

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algos Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the "Haarlem," was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were thereby continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795 Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince as conveyed to him by the British Commander, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which
A capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III, c. 11) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1808, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid and considerable progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £5,000 to promote emigration to the Cape, by means of which 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole southeastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory. Subsequently Lord Glenclig, then Secretary of State, who thought the Kaffirs had had much excuse for their invasion, reversed this Act. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1866 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population, who had become so estranged from the British Government that they preferred the perils of the wilderness to remaining under our rule. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:—1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. 2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenclig in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. 3. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the then Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. The most important event in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which has undoubtedly been one of the main causes of the increase in recent years of the prosperity of the Colony.

The gross weight (avoirdupois) of diamonds contained in packages which passed through the post office at Kimberley is stated to be as follows:

| Year | Weight (lbs.) | Estimated Value (£) |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1876 | 773          | 1,807,532           |
| 1877 | 903          | 2,112,427           |
| 1878 | 1,150        | 2,672,744           |
| 1879 | 1,174        | 2,846,681           |
| 1880 | 1,440        | 3,867,897           |
| 1881 | 1,498        | 4,176,202           |
| 1882 | 1,666        | 8,992,502           |

The declared value of diamonds exported in 1883 was 2,742,470l., 2,867,829 in 1884, 2,489,659l. in 1885, and 3,504,756l. in 1886.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat never oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the more elevated localities and on the higher mountains. The mean temperature at Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is—maximum 72° 2', minimum 52° 9'.

In the Eastern province the chief rainfall is during the summer months, in the Western provinces during the winter months. The summer months may be reckoned from November to April.

Consumption, in its early stages, has been entirely eradicated by residence at the Cape, and patients suffering from the disease even in a considerably advanced stage, have lived many years in the climate of the Cape, after European doctors had given up all hope of their lives.

Diseases of the lungs are rare, and there is a remarkable exemption from cholera, fevers, &c.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Railways.

The railways of the Colony consisted originally of three separate systems, the Western, Midland, and Eastern, having their starting points on the sea-board at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London respectively. The Western and Midland systems are connected by a junction at De Aar (500 miles from Capetown and 340 from Port Elizabeth) and carried forward thence as one trunk line to Kimberley, the centre of the Diamond Fields (647 miles from Capetown and 485 from Port Elizabeth). This line was opened November, 1885. A branch line runs to Colesberg, near the Orange Free State boundary. The Eastern system extends from East London, through Queen's Town, to Aliwal North, adjacent to the Basato-land and Orange Free State frontiers, and was opened September, 1885. A branch extends to King William's Town, 42 miles from East London.

The lengths from Cape Town to Wellington, 64 miles, and from Cape Town to Wynberg, 81 miles, became the property of the Government by purchase; the rest have been constructed, equipped, and maintained at the expense of the general revenue.

The Government mileage open for traffic in December, 1886, was 1,590 miles; the capital
expended on purchase, construction, and equipment to that date being £14,130,616. The gross receipts for 1886 were £1,048,086, compared with £1,057,859 for 1885; the working expenses were £646,715, compared with £672,489 in 1885. For the year ended 30th June, 1887, the results are even more satisfactory, the excess of revenue over expenditure being £519,479, or 8½ per cent. on the cost of construction.

The question of extending the Colonial railways through the Orange Tree State and the South African Republic is now under consideration.

The line between Grahamstown and Port Alfred (about 40 miles), which was constructed by a company subsidised by Government, was opened for traffic on the 24th December, 1883. During the session of 1888 powers were given to a company, to be also aided by a subsidy, to construct a branch from Worcester, on the Western Main Line, down the Breed River as far as Montagu, and this line is now open as far as Robertson.

The Cape Copper Mining Company own and work a mineral line from Port Nolloth to Ookiep (38 miles) in the north-western part of the Colony.

Public Works other than Railways.

Harbour Works on an extensive scale are being constructed at Cape Town, Port Alfred, Port Elizabeth, and East London.

At Cape Town and Port Elizabeth the works are under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members. At Port Alfred and East London they are controlled by the Public Works Department of the Government.

The cost of the works at Table Bay, to the 31st December, 1886, was for the breakwater, docks, &c., £2,186,061.

The breakwater is now being carried out to a length of some 1,233 yards, the portion already completed being 3,050 feet. The graving dock, named the Robinson Dry Dock, was opened for use on the 20th October, 1882. Its length is 539·6 feet, and it is capable of taking ironclads and vessels of the very largest class likely to be sent out to these waters. The cost was £156,689. It is constructed throughout of granite.

Extensive additions to the Harbour Works of Table Bay have been authorised, comprising an outer harbour, formed in part by the existing breakwater, and its extension, and a south arm running parallel with it, which will enclose an area of 64 acres, in addition to the inner docks, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water. The cost is estimated at £405,810.

The works at Port Elizabeth are now completed, from January 1876 to December, 1884, the works constructed were two iron pile jetties, each nearly 900 feet long, which have much facilitated the landing and shipping of passengers and goods; an iron bridge over the Baakens River, and two retaining banks, and the removal of the old wooden jetties, and the old breakwater and Shield. The total expenditure during this period, on removal of old structures, construction of new works, and maintenance, has been £497,754.

At East London and at Port Alfred, situated at the mouths of the Buffalo and Kowie Rivers, the attempt made to overcome the obstructions of the sand-bars which close the entrances, by the construction of training-walls intended to have the effect of removing the bar by the natural scouring of the stream, has resulted in increased depths of water and general improvement. To the 30th June, 1887, there had been expended at East London £587,896, and at Port Alfred £280,708.

Considerable sums have also been expended upon other useful works, and upon opening of the road communications of the country. For these purposes the following sums have been appropriated for expenditure for the financial year, 1886-87; works and other buildings, £24,600; roads and bridges, £32,016.

The new Houses of Parliament in Cape Town were first occupied during the session of 1885. The cost, including furniture, electric lighting, &c., was about £220,000. Government offices have recently been built at Port Elizabeth, and are in course of construction at Kimberley.

Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from the Stormberg on the northeastern frontier is now exclusively used on the eastern system of railways, with a great saving of cost. Its use on the rest of the Colonial railways is hampered by the cost of transport, the only means being by road. This coal is used freely for household purposes at Queenstown, and in other places in the neighbourhood of the fields.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist. The O'kier Mine, the property of the Cape Copper Mining Company (Limited), is believed to be one of the richest in the world. The percentage of copper is 38·00. Between this mine and the seaport (Port Nolloth), a distance of 93 miles, a railway of 2ft. 6in. gauge has been laid by the enterprising Company named, at a cost of no less than £158,100.

The export of copper during the year 1886 was 28,429 tons.

A rich mine of manganese ore, yielding from 70 to 90 per cent., exists in the mountains opposite the Paarl, a town distant about 35 miles by rail from Cape Town.

Gold and other minerals have been found at Knysna and in various parts of the Colony but not in sufficient quantities at present to render the discoveries of much commercial value. Prospecting is however being energetically carried on.

Guano is found in large quantities on the various islets along the coast; and the collection and exportation of it forms a very remunerative industry. The leases of these islands bring in an annual rental of from £6,000 to £7,000.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The history of these Diamond Fields is briefly as follows:—The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin, and the existence of rough diamonds in South Africa was so generally discredited, that nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of Her Majesty's 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of
Cape Colonists from King William's Town proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery had been made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the four mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

When the dry diggings—technically known as "Mines"—were first opened, the searching for stones was carried on with the rude appliances brought from the River, and claim-patches of 30 feet square were worked by individual claim-holders. But as they sunk deeper, the cost of working increased so enormously that the individual was no longer able to work his claim economically, and the digger who worked with pick and shovel has been gradually supplanted by capitalists and wealthy and powerful corporations operating on the most extensive scale, with elaborate and costly machinery, and employing large bodies of overseers and labourers.

The diamondiferous soil is dug or quarried from the so-called mine, which is simply an enormous pit or hole, raised to the surface by means of either aerial tramways or perpendicular shafts, and conveyed to, and spread out to air, upon the "depositing floor," where it lies exposed to the atmosphere for six weeks or two months, varying with the weather, when it is crushed in the "washing machine" which also subjects it to a process of sifting through a graduated series of sieves. The result of the sifting is sorted by hand, and the diamonds are separated from the debris. The hauling and washing engines are almost exclusively driven by steam. The mine is connected with the depositing floor by tramways. At the four mines in 1884 the number of steam engines of various kinds employed was 336, with a total of 3,634 horse-power. The total length of single line of tramways amounted to 160 miles, the neighbourhood of the mines being covered by a network of rails. The mines are known by the names of Kimberley, De Beer's, Du Toit's Pan, and Bultfontein. The two former are the property of the Government, the two latter of the London and South African Exploration Company (Limited). The surface area of Kimberley Mine is 23 acres, its depth nearly 600 feet; the surface area of De Beer's 15 acres, but the depth only 460 feet. The mines of Du Toit's Pan and Bultfontein are considerably larger in superficial area, though not so deep as the others.

The value of claim-ground is assessed for rating purposes as follows:

| Kimberley | £1,364,130 |
| De Beer's | 1,965,830 |
| Du Toit's Pan | 1,133,215 |
| Bultfontein | 492,275 |

Total for the Colony... 4,955,450

The internal affairs of the former two mines are managed by a board, limited to seven members, elected by the claim-holders, and the latter two by a board of three members appointed by the Government.

The severe losses suffered by the mining industry through the illicit trade in rough diamonds have to some extent, though not entirely, been checked by the stringent protective measure known as the "Diamond Trade Act," passed in 1882, the more important provisions of which have been applied, with modifications, to the entire colony by Act No. 14 of 1885. The suppression of the crime employs a large detective force and searching staff, maintained at an annual cost of over 20,000£., derived from fines and duties imposed by the Acts, and from contributions by the mining boards.

The largest diamond known to have been found in Griqualand West weighed 404 carats, or nearly three ounces. The question whether the title of the proprietors of the farms entitles them to the sub-soil diamonds has been violently debated, and involving as it did consequences of great pecuniary magnitude to the diggers, at one time led them to acts of lawlessness which rendered necessary the despatch of a body of Her Majesty's troops to the Diamond Fields to ensure respect for authority. The trouble was averted by the acquisition of the principal farm, Vooruitzigt, for 100,000£. by the Government; and as regards the minor diggings, the matter has now been set at rest by a legislative compromise.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account, and practically the only coin in circulation throughout South Africa. The Colonial Government does not issue notes, but all the banks do so, the issue not being a legal tender.

The banking system is being well developed, there being 10 banks, with 77 separate branches, in 53 different towns and villages. The particulars are given below:

| 30th June, 1887. | Paid up Capital. | Deposits. | Note Circulation. |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (Cape-town, and 60 other branches)... | 1,000,000 | 2,892,556 | 335,763 |
| Bank of Africa, Limited (Cape-town, and 7 other branches)... | 250,000 | 577,497 | 48,580 |
| Eight other banks (viz., Cape of Good Hope, Union, Kafrarian Colonial, Paarl, Stellenbosch District, Wellington, Western Province, and Worcester Commercial, with together 18 branches)... | 1,250,000 | 3,470,053 | 384,363 |
| Total for the Colony... | 1,590,104 | 5,028,209 | 486,663 |

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884; on 30th June, 1887, there was 244,821£. deposited, to the credit of over 11,756 depositors. The interest allowed is 3½ per cent.
Industries.

The colonists at the Cape are chiefly employed in the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and in the breeding of horses, cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of this Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked. Those reserved to the Crown cover an estimated area of about 250,000 acres. They are controlled by the Department of Woods and Forests, at an annual charge of some 10,000£. The attention of the Government has recently been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests with anticipated satisfactory results. The chief exports are diamonds, wood, copper ore, ostrich feathers, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, hardware, explosives, and cereals.

Ostrich breeding is not now carried on so largely as heretofore. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1886 it amounted to 288,568 lbs.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively—885 lbs., 403,153 lbs., and 5,421,006 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 47,454,153 lbs. in 1886.

In twenty-three divisions situated in the eastern, midland, and southern portions of the Colony a compulsory Scab Act has been in operation since the 1st July, 1887. The Superintendent of the Government farm at Constantia reports that considerable changes and improvements took place in 1886 in the wine industry. For the purpose of improving the breed of horses a sum of money has been placed on the estimates for 1887-88. An agricultural branch has been constituted in the department of the Colonial Secretary. The crops in 1887 yielded returns above the average. From estimates made by direction of Government, it appears that the following quantities of grain were reaped in the Colony and the Transkei, viz.: Wheat, 3,583,995; barley, 1,041,112; rye, 360,254; oats, 1,859,441; mealies, 266,137 bushels.

Cape Town, East London, and Port Elizabeth are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1886, 36 vessels registered, of together 3,791 tons.

Education

To promote elementary instruction of all children, industrial training for native lads and girls, and superior instruction to those preparing for the University examinations, the Government gives grants of money in aid of salaries of lecturers and professors (under the Higher Education Act), and of other teachers under Act 13 of 1865, assistance in providing furniture, &c., allowances in aid of expenses of needy boarders at schools amongst the agricultural population, and to maintain native boarders at industrial institutions. In 1884, 91 schools, at which 10,266 children attended, cost the Colony 7,593£., while in June, 1886, there were in the Colony and the Transkei 1,107 schools, with 75,787 scholars, and 4 colleges with 266 students. The Government expenditure on education in the financial year 1885-86 amounted to 91,663£. The local expenditure was 112,815£. in 1885-86, derived from fees and voluntary sources.

The Education Department is under the direction of the Superintendent-General of Education, aided by a staff of inspectors. The local elected boards guarantee half the teachers' salaries, and provide accommodation. There is no school tax.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

Chancellor, Right Hon. the Earl of Carnarvon, D.C.L.

Vice-Chancellor, Langham Dale, Esq., M.A., LL.D.

The Council consists of 20 members. The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowments, &c. The following table shows the number of persons who—

| Matriculated | Inter. Exam. Took direct degrees | Were admitted ad eundem |

Sea and Land Communications.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable. The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 8,981 miles open, erected by the Government at a cost of 355,015£.; the gross receipts in 1886 being 48,516£., and the expenditure 50,421£.

Contracts have been entered into by the Colonial Government for weekly communication between England and the Cape, and vice versa, with the Union Steamship Company and the Castle Mail Packets Company. The packets leave England on Fridays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 21½ days, and in 22½ days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena or Ascension, but premiums are paid for quicker runs. The average passage is 20 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The packets of each Company call at Madeira, both on the outward and homeward voyages, except that the "Castle" packets on alternative voyages call at Lisbon instead of Madeira.

Steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal (distant about 1,000 miles), calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; they usually leave about 24 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A "Castle" Company's steamer leaves Table Bay once a month for Delagoa Bay, and ports on the East Coast of Africa; and that Company also sends a steamer once every eight weeks to Mauritius and Madagascar.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily, with Natal once a week, via the Transkei, with the Orange Free State twice a week, and with the Transvaal four times a week through the Diamond Fields.

The number of Colonial post offices is 618, and of money order offices, 150. The expenditure on the postal service in 1873 amounted to 63,297£., to 233,481£. in 1886; the revenue in 1873 was 41,478£., and the commission on money orders 902£.; the corresponding figures for 1886 were 168,202£. and 2,566£. The weight of registered packets addressed to England, and supposed to contain
diamonds, which passed the Post Office in the years 1874 to 1886, both inclusive, amounted to 17,665 lbs. 9 oz.

Population and Chief Towns.

The population of the whole Colony (excluding Basutoland, but including Griqualand and the Transkeian territories) was estimated in 1885 at 1,252,347 persons. Of these about 840,000 are of European descent, the remainder being coloured or native races, the latter comprising Kaffirs, Fingoes, Hottentots, Bushmen, and Malays. The Europeans are mainly of Dutch, English, or Huguenot descent, with some Germans and Portuguese. 383,765 are returned as belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church, 68,814 as Wesleyans, and 57,895 as Anglicans.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 88,289, and with suburbs 45,240, is laid out at right angles, and contains numerous handsome shops, offices, and churches. The finest building is the edifice providing accommodation for the two Houses of Parliament and the Colonial Office.

Kimberley had a population of 13,590; Port Elizabeth, 18,040; Graham's Town, 6,908; King William's Town, 5,169; Paarl, 5,760; Graaff Reinet, 4,562; Worcester, 3,788; Queenstown, 2,820; East London, 2,184, according to the last census.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1885 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 22 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 74 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer-General, the Attorney-General (who is Premier), the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of 2,000l., or movable property worth 4,000l. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified by possession of property, or receipt of salary or wages, of not less than 50l. per annum, or not less than 2M. with board and lodging. The number of registered electors in 1886 was 88,037. The Native Registration Act of 1887 makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy.

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1862, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act No. 40, of 1882, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puiseux Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, and Tembuland.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members exclusive of the Civil Commissioner as chairman; excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not not less than 500l. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they have also important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force, on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They are 65 in number, and their receipts during the year 1886 amounted to 139,888l., of which 21,263l. was borrowed money for public works. Payments for the same period amounted to 134,517l. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or
chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of which are elected annually by the ratepayers. Town councils or municipalities have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value, excepting in Capetown, where a landlord's rate of 8d. may be levied.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There are 77 municipalities in the Colony, whose receipts from all sources during the year 1886 amounted to 280,362l., which includes 53,165l. borrowed money for public works. Payments during the same period amounted to 275,670l. The Controller and Auditor-General has no control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 46 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, who shall be resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1886 to 2,968l.

Defence.

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison of 1,300 men is usually stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks has, however, devolved since 1871 upon the Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Police (800 strong) and the Cape Mounted Rifles (800 strong; with two field guns), which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 19 Volunteer Corps, of all arms, numbering 3,500 men (with 12 guns), maintained by a capitation grant. Table Bay is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

Dependent Territories.

Basutoland, which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, who also holds the office of Governor of the Cape Colony. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of British Bechuanaland, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under those headings.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amaxosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony. Their object was simply plunder, and the time seemed opportune. They made several forays deep into the Colony. Their number was not very great, but it was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and a group of wooded islands situated among rapids in the Orange River afforded them defensive strongholds not easily wrested from them. For these reasons it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, a position on the northern bank of the Orange, from which the islands can be kept under inspection and constantly patrolled. Since this date there have been no further disturbances.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, as explained in Part I of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekhas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and even invaded what was now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British, by a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere dated the 5th of October, 1877, and confirmed by Lord Carnarvon in a despatch dated the 14th of November, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation the conquered province of Gcalekaland, and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and Sir Hercules Robinson appointed Governor thereof. In 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885 the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased for the purpose from the Chief of the Bomvanas. Pali, chief of the Amatshesi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondomisi tribe, under the chiefs Umdithsha and Umhlouhi, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto rebellion. The Tembus proper sided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents has been effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela (died 1887), for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was also appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remains Chief of East Pondoland. The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881, by which also it has been declared a "free port," and Sir H. Robinson appointed Governor thereof. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.
**CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.**

**WEST PONDOLAND** is under the Chief Nquillis. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for 1,000l.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of the natives in these territories are now subject to Colonial rule (except independent Pondoland, over which there is a British protectorate).

They are now re-grouped, under three Chief Magistrates, with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:—

Griqualand East comprising Nomansland (late Adam Kok's Country), the Gatberg, the Xesibe country, and St. John's Territory, all under one Chief Magistrate, Mr. W. E. Stanford, and nine subordinate magistrates. It has a population of 2,935 Europeans and 98,000 natives; revenue in 1886, 20,416l.; expenditure, 29,775l.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvansland, and Emigrant Tembuland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Elliot, C.M.G., and seven subordinate magistrates. Major Elliot has also charge of the relations of the Government with Pondoland West. It has a population of 5,619 Europeans and 125,000 natives; revenue in 1886, 18,054l.; expenditure 21,375l.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Captain M. S. Blyth, C.M.G., and six subordinate magistrates. It has a population of 876 Europeans and 123,000 natives; revenue in 1886, 18,026l.; expenditure, 16,998l.
