ST. HELENA.

Situation and Area.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad; its area is 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres. The distance from Plymouth is 4,256 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from Plymouth, 14 days, and from Capetown, 5 days.

The capital is James Town, on the N.W. of the island. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The island is very healthy, the average death-rate for the last three years having been only 9-3 per 1,000.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and densely wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1501. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden, of the English Navy, in 1673, took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was finally handed over to the British Government, under an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education.

The Government maintain 4 schools, having 411 scholars. There are also 7 private day schools, not aided by Government, having 465 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordnance No. 4 of 1874, and fees are charged.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, and the entire trade therefore depends exclusively upon the intercourse and the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress. It has greatly diminished in recent years, in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal.

The number of ships calling at the port of James Town (now a free port) for supplies is steadily diminishing. In 1878, including steamers and ships of war, it was 669; in 1879, 602; in 1880, 564; in 1881, 525; in 1882, 497; in 1883, 521; and in 1884, 414; in 1885, 450; and in 1886, 376. It is a port of registry, but has now no ships.

The chief industries are fishing and agriculture, the main arable crops being barley, oats, Indian corn, and potatoes. Some New Zealand flax is also grown.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1886, 5,400£.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England alternately every 3 and 5 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence every third and fourth week, and proceed to England. Rate of postage: to England and the Cape Colony, 6d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post, but there are 10½ miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 700£. The receipts in 1886 were 88£., and the expenses 281£. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Madeira, Capetown, and Loanda.

Tariff.

The Customs Tariff is as follows:

| Tobacco, not manufactured, per lb. | 0 6 |
| Tobacco, manufactured, cigars, and snuff, per lb. | 1 0 |

Excepting when cleared from bond as cargo and borne on ship's manifest.

| Spirits, per gallon | 10 0 |
| Beer in bottles, the dozen quart bottles | 1 0 |
| Beer, all sorts, the hogshead | 19 0 |
| Wine, per gallon | 2 0 |

There are no export duties.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council.

THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

(See Map, page 26.)

Situation and Area.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago is about to be united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British islands are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor-in-Chief, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles, and its population about 130,000. The total exports in 1886 were 356,874l., and the total imports 333,807l.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and is presided over by a resident administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five dollar notes to the extent of 9,800l. in St. Lucia, 11,700l. in Grenada, and 8,000l. in St. Vincent. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language is a French patois.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at most of the islands (at Tobago only monthly). All the islands (except Tobago) are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cables to St. Thomas and St. Croix. There is no railway in any of them.
