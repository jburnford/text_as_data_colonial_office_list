QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.
Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the colony of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,898,080 acres.

History.
The Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The territory was however not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and was only separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland.

Physical Features.
The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels.
A mountain range, called the "Main" or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary, separating the rivers flowing eastward into the Pacific Ocean, and northward into the Gulf of Carpentaria, from those running westward and southward to the ocean, at the Great Australian Bight. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Sugar growing is now becoming a very important industry. In 1886 there were 54,010 acres under cane, of which 34,657 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 58,545 tons of sugar.

Arrowroot is a description of crop which appears to be coming largely into favour with farmers. In 1886 the quantity of land under this crop was 255 acres, which yielded 453,900 lbs.

Fisheries: the coast waters, bays, and rivers abound with excellent fish for the table, the flesh of some of the varieties, such as the guard, whiting, sole, flathead, and silver bream being of great delicacy; while the deep-sea fish, viz., schnapper, king fish, Jew fish, albicore, and mullet resemble in firmness the cod and haddock of northern waters. The oyster banks not only supply the demands of the capital, but form an article of export to the southern colonies.

The dugong, a mammal inhabiting the bays, affords an oil which is much sought after for its curative properties in lung disease; and its hide, when cured, makes excellent belting leather. The turtle also is to be found in numbers in the northern waters of the Colony.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick, on the Darling Downs. In 1886 15,669 acres were planted with this cereal, principally in the localities mentioned. Out of the total area planted the produce of 8,697 acres was mown for hay, and 6,787 acres were reaped for grain, yielding 21,221 bushels.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and from the suitability of soil and climate generally, and the great extent of the territory, this will no doubt continue to be the case.

There are 8,580 squatting "runs" or tracts of land containing 72,281 sq. miles, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

The importance of the pastoral interests will be seen by the value of the following exports of home products connected with this industry for the year 1886:

| Item                  | Value     |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Wool                  | £1,413,908|
| Hides and skins       | £101,729  |
| Horses, cattle, and sheep | £722,575 |
| **Total**             | **£2,238,212** |

Mining has proved a great source of wealth to the Colony. During the year 1886 the exports of gold, tin, and silver were valued at 1,232,330L, 192,564L, and 58,637L respectively.

The Gympie and Charters Towers gold fields still maintain large mining populations, and the yield from their reefs, although satisfactory, is not so favourable as would be the case if more scientific appliances were available for the extraction of the metal. During the year 1884 an important discovery of gold was made near Rockhampton, at a place called Mount Morgan. The find is undoubtedly a very rich one; but, being on private and not on Crown land, it is difficult to obtain reliable information as to the actual yield. The geological character of this goldfield is peculiar, the gold being found in a frothy porous sinter, so light that it floats in the water like pumice, and the fine gold is disseminated throughout the sinter which is supposed to have been deposited by a thermal spring. Another important discovery was made during the year 1880 in tin mining at Herberton, in the Cardwell district. The returns are very good, and already a large and apparently permanent township has sprung up in the locality. There are lead mines in operation at Ravenswood, the ore from which yields a good percentage of silver. There are also large deposits of gold in the district. Cinnabar, antimony, and manganese are also among the mineral products.

Near St. Lawrence, and on the adjacent islands, marble of fine grain is found, which at present finds no better use than being consigned to the lime kilns.

Valuable timber of various descriptions grows in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hardwood, which is most in demand: flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood,* &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia

* Beech and yellow wood are hard wood timbers.
constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; *Euphorbia Drummondii*, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; *Euphorbia pilulifera*, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Excellent coal has already been found in some localities, and new discoveries are being frequently made. There were 218,606 tons of this mineral raised during 1886, valued at 91,817l. At Burrum, in the Maryborough district, splendid coal has been discovered, and a railway constructed to the spot, in order to bring the mineral to the Port of Maryborough.

Brisbane, Maryboro, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1886, 183 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 14,323.

**Population.**

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51.20 per cent. in 5 years, and the estimated population on 31st December, 1886, was 342,614.

There are above 225 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 27 are under Municipal Government, contain a population of about 128,349. The receipts of the local authorities in 1886 were 294,243l.; their expenditure 332,571l., the assessed annual value of the property in the districts under their control 1,828,028l., and debt 483,626l.; in addition to debts for water works amounting to 364,564l. In the same year the revenue of the country divisions amounted to 252,335l., their expenditure to 252,257l., and debt to 98,716l.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully situated on a fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, has a population of about 73,679. It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast, and the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

**Currency and Banking.**

There were 10 banks with 114 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 1,652,593l.; deposits, 7,170,780l.; note circulation, 643,663l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 37,559, the amount of deposits as 1,337,965l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

**Means of Communication.**

At the end of 1886 the railways in Queensland showed 1,555 miles in operation, the cost of construction being 10,716,352l., the revenue being 640,845l., and the working expenses 476,966l. There were 637 miles of railway authorised or in course of construction. The following lines are now open for traffic:—The Southern and Western from Brisbane to Dalvadilla; with its branches, Ipswich to Fassifern, Toowoomba to Warwick and Stanthorpe, and Toowoomba to Cabarlah; also a branch from Warwick to Killarney. An extension of the Western line is also in progress to Morven. There is a line open to Gympie and one also to Howard from Maryborough, which latter is about to be extended to Bundaberg. In the latter district the line is open from the township of that name to Mount Perry, a great copper mining centre.

**The Central Railway** is open from Rockhampton to Alice.

**The Northern Railway** is open from Townsville to Torrens Creek, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter a town of about 10,000 inhabitants, and a great gold mining centre. This railway is now being extended to Hughenden, 23½ miles into the interior. From all the above railways many branches are being constructed tending to open up the Colony. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook and Carpentaria Division a railway is being constructed to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 33 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also in course of construction from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Herberton, the great tin mining centre.

There are 282 electric telegraph stations in the colony. The number of miles of line 8,225, with 14,443 miles of wire. The net revenue for 1886 was 82,958l., in addition to 21,550l., the value of work performed for the public service, for which the department received no remuneration.

The number of messages despatched during 1886 was 1,201,495. The telephone is also much used between the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 586 subscribers who use it, and aerial cables containing multiple wires are now being used to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks, with supplementary steamers every fortnight; via Brindisi and Melbourne every fortnight; via San Francisco and Sydney every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi and Torres Straits is forty-nine days. There is almost daily communication with Sydney and Melbourne, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia and with Singapore. The rates of postage are:—

| Letters, per ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|------------|
| Within a town      | 1d.        | Free       |
| Australasia        | 2d.        |            |
| Europe, United States | 6d.    | 1d. por 4 oz. |

**Education.**

A Government system of elementary education was established by Law 39 Vic. No. 1. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and the local control is conducted by school boards. There are 479 schools, containing 58,939 children on the roll. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 108 private schools, with 6,670 children on the roll.

**Defence.**

The permanent land defence force of the Colony, including the staff, consists of 121 officers and 1,529 non-commissioned officers and men; the volunteer force of 26 officers and 567 non-commissioned officers and men. There is also a force of cadets numbering 6 officers and 130 non-commissioned officers and privates.

Marine defence is provided for by a gunboat, and by three naval brigades and one artillery corps.
Immigration.

The European immigration for the year 1886 was 11,253. The arrivals from Hong Kong numbered 501, and from the South Sea Islands, 1,595.

The land order system of immigration has been discontinued, the present liberal system of disposing of the public lands of the Colony being considered by the Legislature a sufficient attraction to the better class of immigrants from Europe likely to engage in pastoral and agricultural pursuits. A very extensive system of immigration direct from England was established by means of the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels in the latter part of the year 1881. These ships coming through the Suez Canal and via Torres Straits, enable the Government to distribute the immigrants carried by them at various ports on the eastern seaboard, where they are likely to obtain employment or wish to settle themselves.

By Law No. 13 of 1884 a poll tax of 30l. is levied upon every Chinese arriving in the Colony.

Lands.

The several Acts of Parliament under which land may be secured are "The Pastoral Leases Act of 1869," "The Mineral Lands Act of 1882," "The Gold Fields Act of 1874," and the "Crown Lands Act of 1884."

"The Crown Lands Act of 1884" has superseded all former Crown Lands Acts, and is now the only statute which provides for the leasing or alienation of the Crown lands of the Colony.

Under this Act, portions of the runs at present held under former Pastoral Leases Acts, amounting to one-fourth, one-third, and even one-half, according to the length of the leases yet to run, will be resumed for sub-division; the balance may be held by the present lessees on certain terms, with longer leases than those under which they have hitherto been held.

In the resumed portions, grazing farms may be selected in proclaimed districts, in areas of not more than 20,000 acres, nor less than 2,560 acres, at a rent to be fixed by the Land Board, not being less than 8s. 4d. per acre per annum. The proclamation opening the land for selection will declare the maximum area which may be selected in each district and the rent. When an application has been approved of by the Land Commissioner, and confirmed by the Board, a non-transferable licence will be issued for three years, and within that time a selector must enclose his farm with a substantial fence. At the end of this period, if the selector proves that he has so fenced in his holding, and performed the condition of residence, a transferable lease for 30 years will be granted him, at a rent to be determined every five years by the Land Board.

Suitable agricultural areas will also be proclaimed in which agricultural farms may be selected of not more than 1,280 acres, nor less than 320 acres, but any person may apply for and select any smaller area that is comprised in one complete surveyed block. The proclamation opening the land to selection will declare the maximum area which may be selected in any one district, will specify the lots and their areas, the rent, which is not to be less than 3l. per acre, and the purchasing price. A licence will be issued to the selector, who must within five years fence in the land or make permanent improvements of a value equal to the cost of the fence. When the conditions of residence and improvements are fulfilled, a transferable lease for 50 years will be granted, at a rent to be determined every five years by the Land Board. If the lessee can prove ten years continued residence, he will be entitled to purchase the holding at a price to be fixed by the Land Board, which will not be less than 20s. per acre.

In the case of an agricultural farm of not more than 160 acres, if the lessee proves five years' residence, and an expenditure of not less than 10s. an acre on permanent improvements, he can secure the fee simple by paying such sum as shall, with the rent already paid, amount to 2s. 6d. an acre.

The Government will also conduct sales of land by auction in and near townships. The upset price of town blocks may be 8s. per acre, the size varying from one rood to one acre. Suburban lands within one mile from the town lands will be in lots from one to five acres; beyond again from one to ten acres, the upset price being 2l. per acre.

Of the 427,838,080 acres contained in the Colony, the total granted in fee-simple up to the end of 1886 was 8,455,038 acres, for which 5,508,680l. had been paid.

Government.

The Government of Queensland is composed of the Governor, appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, and an Executive Council, composed of the responsible ministers of the Crown. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected by the suffrages of the people. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. The franchise is on the most liberal footing, every man of 21 years, who has resided as much as six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 36 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act No. 10 of 1887, the Colony is divided into 60 districts, of which 12 return two members, and 48 return one member each, or a total of 72 members. The most northerly district in the Colony, Somerset, is as yet unrepresented.
