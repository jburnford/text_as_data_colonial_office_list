TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The Colony will henceforth include Tobago (hitherto in the Windward Islands), which is about to be amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1582, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.

Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the great preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercrombie, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

General Description.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. Coffee has of late been largely cultivated, and with great success, bidding fair to become a very considerable factor in the future exporting power of the colony. Tobacco of a superior quality is also largely grown. Molasses, rum, bitters, cocoanuts and asphalté, are also imported.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the past 25 years has been 65-49 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1886 was 77.1° Fahr., the mean maximum being 89.9°, and the mean minimum 69.3°.

The chief town and principle port of Trinidad is Port of Spain (population in 1881 31,858), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 92 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,672. The harbour is the best in the West Indies.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1881, 6,335), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

Both these towns possess elective municipal councils and mayors. The municipal revenue of Port of Spain was in 1886 16,550l., and the expenditure 16,501l. That of San Fernando was 4,701l. and 4,808l. respectively. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

There is no municipal debt.

A pitch lake, 109 to 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value, and yields a slight but increasing revenue to the island.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,123,000 acres, the alienated acreage is given below, according to the last assessment:

| Cultivated in Sugar Cane | 52,163 |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Cacao and Coffee        | 43,363 |
| Ground Provisions       | 18,053 |
| Coconuts                | 2,767 |
| Pasture                 | 6,242 |
| Uncultivated            | 190,997 |
| **Total alienated**     | **313,585** |

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers, which ply three times a week, and by the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Princes Town in 1884. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande, and a short line at Chaguanaus, used chiefly for the conveyance of sugar. The total length of line open is 51½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total cost of the railways has been 602,352l.; the receipts during 1886 were 49,813l., and the expenditure 42,659l. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund, which in 1886 was 32,611l.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and 40 out offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, and thence, via the United States, with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 68 miles, constructed by the Government at a total cost of 3,150l. The receipts in 1886 were 440l., and the expenses 904l., the total number of messages sent being 12,472.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad has within the last few years increased considerably, the number per month being now 35, viz., 4 royal mail steamers, 2 royal mail cargo steamers, 4 of the steamers of the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 4 of the West India and Pacific Line, one of the Har-
rison Line, and 2 of Joseph Hoult's Line, from Liverpool; 4 of the London Direct Line steamers, 1 Clyde steamer, 2 of the Quebec and Gulf Line, and 2 of the Atlantic and West India Line from America, 2 Dutch line, and 7 steamers running between the island and Venezuela. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows per ½ oz. letter:

| Distance          | Rate |
|-------------------|------|
| Within Colony     | 1    |
| Beyond 300 miles  | 4    |

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £41,276 was expended in 1886, besides the fixed establishment of the department, the cost of which is about £3,552. The number of Indian immigrants during each of the last three years was as follows:

- 1884: 3,147
- 1885: 1,706
- 1886: 2,185

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British silver and bronze, United States gold currency, and gold doubloons. These are all legal tender, as is also British gold, which is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of £130,000. There is no Colonial coinage or note issue.

The Colonial Bank has branches at Port of Spain and San Fernando. Government savings banks are established in ten districts. The balance in these banks at the end of 1886 was £97,458. They are under the management of the Receiver-General and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879. There is also a Rifle Association. It now numbers 235 members.

The Police Force of the island consists of 435 men.

Education.

Education has made considerable progress in Trinidad for some years past. The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, aided only by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, the College of the Immaculate Conception. Attached to these institutions are three exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of £150, each tenable for three years at some university in Great Britain or Ireland. There were at the end of 1886 65 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and 220 on those of the College of the Immaculate Conception.

From the Government primary schools to the Queen's Royal College there are annually open to competition three free admissions, each tenable for three years.

The primary schools are now 117 in number, 53 of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and 64 denominational and assisted. The Government schools are generally well supplied with school requisites; their furniture is constructed on good models, and some of them are held in creditable buildings. Fees are exacted and paid with fair regularity, the usual rates being three pence per head per week; at some schools the charge is two shillings per month, and at the Model Schools five shillings per month. There is a reduction when the fees are paid quarterly in advance, and reduced rates are charged for the second and third children in a family. In connexion with the Boys' Model School there is a Training College for male teachers, which admits twelve resident and seven non-resident students. The staff of the Government schools includes 51 masters, 12 mistresses, 10 assistant masters, 67 assistant and work mistresses, and 70 pupil teachers, paid monitors, and normal students.

The number of pupils attending the primary schools was as follows:

| Year | Government Schools | Assisted Schools | Total |
|------|--------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1884 | 3,904              | 5,182            | 9,086 |
| 1885 | 4,911              | 5,511            | 10,422|
| 1886 | 4,212              | 6,315            | 10,527|

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private adventure schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. Under the Presbyterian Coolie Mission there are thirteen estate schools, having about 453 pupils; so that it may be roughly estimated that the number of children attending school in Trinidad is about 13,500.

Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an executive council of three members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 6 official, and 8 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 64 miles long and 2 miles broad. It contains 2,500 inhabitants.

History.

These islands were originally settled from Bermuda in the eighteenth century, and formed at first a portion of that Colony. In 1799 they were transferred, for purposes of government, to the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered exceeding 1½ million bushels. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There is one sponge curing establishment on the Caicos Islands.

An agricultural settlement was started under Government auspices at North Caicos in 1882, to grow fruit for export, but has proved a failure, owing to the absence of any remunerative market for the produce. The soil elsewhere is totally unfit for agricultural purposes.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English.

Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had on the 31st December, 1886, 49 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 7,187 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never failing sea breezes.

The mean temperature (day) 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall is 25 inches, the rainy season being from October to February.

Means of Communication.

The Clyde Line from New York to Hayti calls at Grand Turk every three weeks, the length of passage being six days; and there are two lines of steamers from Boston to Hayti which call at irregular intervals. There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony.

The rate of letter postage to nearly all parts of the world is 4d. per half ounce. There is no internal postage.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Jamaica, distant 400 miles, but messages are always sent via New York, there being no steam communication with Jamaica.

Education.

There are seven elementary schools supported by Government, with an attendance of over 800 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free. A compulsory education ordinance, providing also for the payment of fees, was passed in 1883, but the compulsory clauses have never been proclaimed. There is one Wesleyan school, with an attendance of 85, and some small private schools.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, Spanish, Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no paper currency. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. There is no bank.

Constitution.

The local Legislature consists of a Legislative Board consisting of the Chief Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure, and other matters of a purely local character, are regulated by this Board; but all laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica, which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands, take effect there.
