HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, between 22° 9' and 22° 1' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west.

west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kow-loon was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China; and now forms part of the colony.

General Description.

The waterways of the colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The picturesque hills which surround it rise between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The City of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, 160,000 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees.

The minimum annual rainfall for the last 16 years was 56 inches and the maximum 99 inches, the annual average being 86·18 inches, while the average range of the thermometer is from 45° to 92°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was first ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843.

Hong Kong is valuable to Great Britain mainly as a factory for our commerce with China, and as a military and naval station for the protection of that commerce. It did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1849, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, producing rope, sugar, and bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected, may be approximately estimated from the fact that the amount of shipping, British, Foreign, and Chinese, which entered the port in 1886 exceeded six million tons.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips which are well supplied with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every requirement for making large repairs to ships of war and merchant vessels.

Currency and Banking.

There is a colonial coinage of dollars and half dollars, and these, with Mexican and other full weight dollars, are alone legal tender. There is also a colonial bronze coinage. Altogether nearly $3,000,000 has been issued in silver and bronze, about two-thirds of which is in circulation. There are four principal banks (New Oriental, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) having a note circulation of $4,000,000. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. Five other banks have agencies in the Colony.

Means of Communication.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world by a cable to Shanghai (and thence to Japan and Russia) and two cables to Singapore via Saigon and Hué respectively; and there is very extensive steam communication with Europe, America, and Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Messageries Maritimes which convey the European mails weekly, the Pacific Mail Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly service, via Yokohama, Japan, with San Francisco, and the Eastern and Australian Mail Steam Company have a monthly service with the Australian Colonies. The Norddeutsche Lloyd and the Austrian Lloyd steamers go to and from Europe monthly, and those of the Canadian Pacific line monthly to and from Japan and British Columbia.

There is daily steam communication between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton, and about twice a-week with the ports of Swatow, Amoy, Foo Chow, Shanghai, and other ports on the coast of China. The communication with Japan is a weekly one. There are no railways; and no internal telegraph communication except for police and military purposes. The island possesses few roads, and the usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. |
|------------------|
| Hong Kong, Canton and Macao | 2 cents |
| China and Japan | 5 " |
| Europe and America | 10 " |
| Australasia and South Africa | 25 " |

Education.

There is a central Government Boys' School, with low fees, 15 free Government schools (5 teaching English), and 19 aided Chinese village schools for boys. Besides these, there are 55 grants-in-aid-schools, 52 of which are free, belonging to 8 different Missionary Societies. These are denominational, the Government schools being strictly secular. There were 5,841 children on the rolls in 1886, besides 2,218 in 111 private schools, mostly Chinese, which are not aided or inspected. The only central administrative organisation is the department of the Inspector of Schools. The languages taught are English, Portuguese, and three separate dialects of Chinese. Some scholarships have been founded by Government for higher education. There is no provision for industrial or
technical education. Not more than one in five of the Chinese girls are under instruction, and only one-third of the boys.

**Defence**

There is an Imperial garrison of about 1,300 men, towards the cost of which the Colony contributes 20,000L annually. There is also a Volunteer Artillery Corps with 99 effective members. It is the head-quarters of the China Squadron, and there is usually at least one war vessel present. Land batteries of powerful armament have been erected with the view of protecting the town and anchorage.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six officials besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of six official and five unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (one being usually a Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. By the provisions of the Vice-Admiralty Courts' Act of 1863, the Governor is ex officio Vice-Admiral, and the Chief Justice ex officio Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances. The law as to civil procedure was codified by an Ordinance of 1873.
