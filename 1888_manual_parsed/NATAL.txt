NATAL.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from the fact of its discovery by Vasco de Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas-day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about eight hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between 29th and 31st parallels of S. lat.: it is bounded by the Tugela and Umzimkulu Rivers, and by the Drakensberg Mountains. It comprises an area of about 18,750 square miles, and has a seaboard of one hundred and seventy miles. Natal is a well-watered country, no less than 28 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the one hundred and fifty miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of 14,000; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 18,000 inhabitants, of whom half are Kaffirs and Indians.

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco de Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Marines, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage endeavoured to colonize it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country,

* There was formerly another British settlement named Natal, a factory of the East India Company on the west coast of Sumatra, founded 1751, and not finally abandoned until the cession of Sumatra to the Dutch in 1824.
sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up at his death, about four years later.

Towards the close of the year 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to his brother Chaka. During the next two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with various success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith, (1840). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete, with whom a junction was effected. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In August, 1845, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. And in November of the same year other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, as well as an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1848, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

**Constitution.**

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, and from that time has not been under the control of the Governor of the Cape. Its affairs are administered by a Governor, assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, composed originally of four official members, and 12 members elected by the counties and boroughs. Under the Supplementary Charter of December, 1869, two members of the Legislative Council are elected member of the Executive Council, whilst the number of official members of the Legislative and Executive Councils was increased to five.

The elected members of Council hold their seats for four years from date of election, unless the Council is dissolved by the Governor. Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of £50., or is in receipt of rents from property of an annual value of £10., or who has been a resident in the Colony, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to £1. per month, or 96l. per annum is entitled to a vote; the usual provisions respecting the disqualification of aliens, and others hold good. No person can be elected a member of Council, unless he is a duly qualified and registered elector.

The Reserved Civil List is fixed at 40,100L under the Supplementary Charter of 1872.

By Law No. 3 of 1875 the number of nominated members was increased to 13, including the 5 official members, but this law was allowed to lapse. By Law No. 1 of 1883 the number of nominated members is raised to 7 in all, and the number of elected members to 28.

**Native Affairs.**

In autumn 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amalubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, entered on a somewhat contumacious course of conduct towards the local government, ending in an attempt to escape from the Colony into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his son were transported to Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The Langalibalele affair brought into prominence the system under which the native population had been managed by the Natal Government, and Sir Garnet Wolseley was specially commissioned to proceed to the Colony as administrator, and to consider and report upon the Native question, and the question of defence.

The Native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 8 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crimes *mala in se*.

The native population was debarred from the franchise, but by an Act No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law, in which case he would be entitled to all the rights of an ordinary Colonist. The tribes live apart, upon locations provided for them by the Government. But besides these location natives there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the Chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary *criminal* law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. A white magistrate is placed with every tribe, who is the administrator of justice in civil matters, and supersedes to a considerable extent the authority of the Chiefs; and it is hoped gradually to accustom the Kafirs to regular industry, and the individual ownership of property in the civilised way. By a law, No. 13 of 1875, a tax of 5L. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s.

**Climate and Inhabitants.**

The climate varies, but is usually mild, cool, and bright. The mean temperature at Pietermaritzburg is 65°, and at Durban 69°. The rainfall at the coast is about 40 inches, and less inland. The rainy season is from October to March inclusive.
More than four-fifths of the inhabitants are Zulu Kaffirs, and 7 per cent. are Indian Coolies. The Europeans nearly all speak English, but half of them are of Dutch descent, with some Germans.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with the Cape and England, once or twice a month with Mauritius, and frequently with Australia direct.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the South African Republic and the Cape, and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, and Europe.

The rates of postage are:

| Letters, ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|---------------|------------|
| Internal      | 1          |
| Cape and Transvaal | 2        |
| England and Mauritius | 6       |
| Europe and United States | 7½     |
| South America and West |         |
| Africa        | 9          |
| India and China | 10       |
| Australasia   | 11         |

There are 488 miles of Government telegraphs, with 46 stations. There are 217 miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government. The main line is from Pietermaritzburg to the Port of Durban, 72 miles, with a branch northwards from Umgeni to Verulam, 1¼ miles, and one south to the Isipingo River, 7 miles. The work was begun in January, 1876, and completed in November, 1880. A further extension to Ladysmith (118 miles) was completed early in 1886.

Defence.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of 1886 consisted of 1,337 of all ranks. This includes a volunteer naval force of 98 men.

There is also an armed and mounted police force, numbering 183 Europeans of all ranks, and 25 natives. The port of Durban is being strongly fortified.

Industry

The chief exports are wool, sugar, hides, maize, hair, arrowroot, and ostrich feathers.

There is a large transit trade with Zululand, the Orange Free State, and the South African Republic. The harbour of Durban, which has a somewhat dangerous bar, has been much improved by the works of the Harbour Board. It is a port of registry, having in 1886 13 vessels, with a total tonnage of 1,061 tons. The main industry of the Colony is, however, agriculture: large numbers of cattle, sheep, and ostriches being reared, and large crops of maize and sugar being raised. There are several mines of coal.

Currency and Banking

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, and the Bank of Africa, have together eleven establishments, with 1,082,188l. deposits, and 71,363l. note circulation. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1886 50,483l. deposits.

Education.

There are 14 Government schools, with 2,895 scholars, and 35 aided denominational schools, with 1,654 scholars. The management is vested in a Council of Education, and the local control in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. There are also 54 native schools receiving government aid, with an attendance of 2,889, and 27 Indian schools, of which 23 are aided, with an attendance of 1,702.

Tariff,

The following is the table of customs duties levied under authority of Laws No. 18, 1866; No. 1, 1867; Nos. 2 and 20, 1872; No. 17, 1874; No. 11, 1875; Nos. 2, 3, and 4, 1881; and No. 14, 1884; and No. 4 of 1886.
