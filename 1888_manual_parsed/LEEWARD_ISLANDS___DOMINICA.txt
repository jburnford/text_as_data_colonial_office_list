DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 20' and 15° 45' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 80' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad; very mountainous and picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, and has an area of 291 square miles.

This island was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Carribean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations. In 1756, Dominica became by conquest a dependency of England.

By the ninth article of the peace, signed at Paris between England and France in 1763, Dominica was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling the lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092l. 11s. 1d. sterling.

The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising, besides Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and...
became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Du-chilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prevost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts, making ready for battle, should they be attacked. Since this period the island has not known war.

Sugar is the chief product, but some fruit, cocoa, and timber are also exported from the Island. It abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish, and there is abundance of game.

The chief town is Roseau, population about 4,500; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1886, eight vessels, of a total tonnage of 141. These are mostly engaged in coasting trade.

The Local Government is administered by a President, aided by an Executive Council of seven members. In 1865 the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members, to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The president presides over the deliberations of this body, and exercises a casting vote in the House, and a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committee.

Electors for a parish must possess land or houses to be rented at £1 per annum, or be an occupier of premises worth £1 per annum, or have an income of £25l., or pay taxes of £1s. per annum.

**MALTA.**

**Situation and Area.**

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valletta, the port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is about 95 square miles; that of Gozo 20 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile.

**History.**

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1400. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Greeks, and then of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese islands fell alter-
nately to the lot of the Carthaginians and Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of Paul took place (Acts xxviii). On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell to the Goths, and then to the Saracens, who were expelled in 1090 by Count Roger the Norman. It was under the dominion of the House of Aragon from 1190 until 1530, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V. to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, Malta capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte, who dispersed the Order. The Maltese, however, rose against their conquerors, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they were closely blockaded for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain, 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

Climate.

The climate of Malta is equable and not unhealthy. In August the heat almost equals that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is $61^\circ$ Fahr., and the minimum $53^\circ$; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is $82^\circ$ Fahr., and the minimum $78^\circ$. The mean temperature is $67^\circ$, and the annual rainfall varies from 10 to 20 inches.

Industry.

The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton, potatoes, and corn; the vine is grown; oranges and figs are abundant; honey of a superior kind is also produced; and early crops of potatoes are exported to England. But a large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the enormous trade of Valetta as an entrepot and port of call. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1886, 119 vessels, of together 11,642 tons. There is a large trade with Tunis, Tripoli, and Algeria.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banco di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The three banks have a small note circulation, amounting to about 40,000l. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1833, had in 1886 376,253l. deposits.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway 8½ miles in length belonging to the Malta Railway Company, Limited, and there are 65 miles of telegraph constructed and worked by the military authorities, but open to public use. Valetta has an extensive telephone system, and is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables to Gibraltar, Bone (Algeria), Sicily (2), and Alexandria (2).

It is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean line of steamers, and is a most important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling in quarantine, and at any hour, day and night. There is direct mail communication with nearly every Mediterranean port, and with England, via Sicily or Naples, several times per week. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per oz | Newspapers |
|---------------|------------|
| Internal      | ¼d.        | Free.     |
| Europe, Tunis, the Levant, and the United States | 2½d. | 1d. per 2 oz. |
| Australasia, West Indies, India, &c. | 4d. | 1d. per 1 oz. |
| South Africa   | 7½d.       | 2d. per 4 oz. |

Public Works.

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and has greatly improved their sanitary condition. The reorganization of the water supply, hitherto very defective, has also been taken in hand, and considerable progress already made towards securing an effective supply of pure water for all purposes. In connection with this work arrangements are contemplated for an extension of the means of irrigation. Considerable progress has also been made lately in improving the roads and streets and in public lighting.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, consisting of six members. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly elective council of government originally constituted by letters patent of 11th May, 1849. The Council of Government consisted of a president and 17 members, 9 official and 8 elected. By letters patent of 12th December, 1887, the number of official members has been reduced to 6, besides the President, and the number of elected members raised to 14, 4 of whom will be elected by special electors, and chosen from the classes of ecclesiastics, nobles, graduates, and members of the chamber of commerce respectively. Public officers are ineligible for election, and not more than two ecclesiastics may be chosen by the general electors. The constituency, under the letters patent of 2nd March, 1883, amounts to 10,627. The qualification for a member of Council is the possession of immovable property of the clear value of 100l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immovable property to the annual value of 10l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40l. a year for board and lodging, for the same period previous to election. The qualification for a general elector is an income from immovable property of 6l. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6l. per annum for six calendar months before registration. That of a special elector, and of the members elected by this class, is an income from immovable property of 60l., or payment of rent of that amount. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts three years. The governor is ex officio President, with the power of veto.

Education and Religion.

Primary education is carried on almost exclusively in Government schools, which are free. There is a public lyceum or secondary school, with 403 scholars, and a university (founded in 1769) with 48 students. At these institutions the fees are extremely low, being respectively 1s. and 2s. 6d. per family per month. There are numerous private secondary schools. The total number of
schools is 210, with 10,616 scholars. Education is not compulsory. The Roman Catholic religion is almost universal amongst the Maltese.

Revenue.

There is no direct taxation of any kind.

The most important sources of revenue in Malta are the Customs duties, levied under the following tariff ordinances:—3rd Nov., 1837, III of 1857, III of 1870, VIII of 1869, and VIII of 1870.
