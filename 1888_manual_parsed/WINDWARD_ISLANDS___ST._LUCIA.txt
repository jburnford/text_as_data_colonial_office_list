ST. LUCIA.

Situation and Area.

The island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique, and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 42 miles in length, and 21 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is one hundred and fifty miles, and its area 158,620 acres. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, contains about 900 houses, and a population of about 4,555 souls. Next in importance is the town of Soufriere, containing a population of 2,286 souls.

History.

At the period of its discovery, St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to M.M. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent d'Orléans made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros Ilet Bay, in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th of April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms, on the 4th of April, 1794.

In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hughes, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Greenfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued under British rule.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by intestine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies. Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population now amounts to 41,000. The reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is undeserved. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordillera. Castries, the chief town, is an excellent harbour, probably the best in the whole...
of the West Indies. It is now the second naval station of the Empire in these parts, and will doubtless become of great commercial importance as a port of call when the Panama Canal is completed. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, 11 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 501 tons. It has been chosen as the chief coaling station for the fleet in the West Indies, and is being strongly fortified.

Constitution.

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy. The Courts of Justice were an inferior Court called the "Sénéchaussée," and a higher Court called the "Conseil Supérieur," or Court of appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided, and it was invested with certain executive and administrative functions.

The Government is now conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council. The Legislature consists of the Administrator and a Council composed as the Queen may direct. Law is administered by a judge, from whom in civil cases there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal of the Windward Islands, and by three magistrates, whose decisions are liable to review by the judge. In criminal cases tried in the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of twelve as in England.

A code of civil law, the authors of which are Sir G. W. Des Vœux, K.C.M.G., the late Administrator of the Government, and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., the late Chief Justice, became law in October, 1879. This code has been framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances.

Industry.

Sugar, cocoa, and spices are produced. There is a central sugar "Usine" with the best machinery, in which the Colonial Government has an interest.

Immigration from the East was resumed in April, 1878, and there is at present in the Colony an Indian population of about 2,400.
