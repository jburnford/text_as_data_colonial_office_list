ZULULAND.

Situation and Area.

Zululand is the territory lying to the north of Natal, from which it is divided by the River Tugela. It is bounded on the east by the Indian Ocean, on the north and north-west by the "New Republic," and on the north by Tongaland. It comprises the territory formerly known as the Zulu Reserve, with about two-thirds of the territory restored to Cetywayo in 1888, and it was formally declared British territory in May, 1887. Its area is 8,900 square miles (the Reserve having been 2,567, Eastern Zululand 5,653, and St. Lucia Lake 680 square miles). The "New Republic" comprises 2,854 square miles, and is an independent state.
History.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe of Kaffirs who seem under Chaka to have pressed southwards in the beginning of the century, and to have become consolidated into a powerful and well organised kingdom. Chaka was murdered and succeeded by Dingaan in 1828, and came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Panda. In the latter years of King Panda Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons. This state of things appeared to be of such evil consequence to the general peace, that is the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. Theson chosen as heir, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new government. The Zulu war party, with the prime minister at their head, wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone and Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being however by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the lower Tugela Drift, and at the same time these representatives were put in possession of the demands on other subjects, called in the history of the war "the ultimatum."

The ultimatum demanded from Cetywayo the surrender of several Zulus accused of crimes in Natal and a fine of 600 cattle from Cetywayo.

Besides these demands in respect of outrages, other requirements were made on Cetywayo in respect of the government of his country. These were that he should receive a British Resident; that he should allow missionaries to live securely in his country; that he should abolish his military system by which every man was a soldier belonging to one or other of the king's regiments, and liable to be called up to military service at the word of the king; that he should not go to war without the consent of his National Council and the British Resident; that he should observe his coronation promises against unjust killing, and that he should abolish the laws restricting marriage among his subjects.

Twenty days were given to him to comply with the first class of demands, and thirty days to comply with the second. The longer of these periods having elapsed, and the king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Sandhluwa, the other at Inyezane. In the first an impi of 18,000 Zulus attacked the camp of the Rorke's Drift column, which was defended by about half the column, the other half having proceeded with the general to what was intended to be the next camping ground. The camp transport ammunition and artillery were taken, and about 1,000 Europeans slain. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, which was held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. (now Major) Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night, the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the engagement of Inyezane, Colonel Pearson, in command of the Lower Tugela column, defeated the enemy and occupied the hill mission station of Eshowe, where he proceeded to entrench himself.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. But even in this part British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but on the following day the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a defeat, which from their own testimony they seem to have regarded as the severest chastisement which they received in the course of the war.

At the beginning of April reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe. His lordship defeated the enemy at Ginginhlava on the 3rd of April, and the same day relieved the garrison of Eshowe, which place was then abandoned.

No general engagement was fought after this until the 4th of July, when the main army advancing upon Wood's original line of march from Utrecht, fought the battle of Ulundi, when the military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces. Cetywayo fled to the bush, with a few followers. The Zulu army never again assembled in force. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent Chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

The main defect in this arrangement was the want of a recognised and paramount authority;
and difficulties were soon experienced in its working. Some of the appointed chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise the authority of those placed over them. A large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo, more than one deputation visiting the Natal Government to make known their wishes on the subject. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement, with a view to its being placed on a stable footing. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over a part of his former kingdom, subject to certain conditions, and to constitute the remainder of Zululand an independent native territory. The whole country north of the Umlostoosi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain, was restored to Cetywayo, and the territory between the Umlostoosi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner. It was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was re-installed by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable and more intractable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, a defeated exile, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death the Usutus finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers from the Transvaal and elsewhere, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who was driven to take refuge in the Reserve. As a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they have established a Republic.

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government then decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887.

On the 18th Dec., 1884, the British flag had been hoisted at St. Lucia Bay, which was ceded to the English Government by Panda in 1843.

The Zulu Native Reserve was administered by a resident commissioner, immediately responsible to H.M.'s special commissioner for Zulu affairs; and order was maintained by a force of mounted native police. This organisation has now been extended over the whole territory.

Law and Constitution.

The Territory is at present administered through a Resident Commissioner residing at Eshowe, under the direct supervision of Sir A.E. Havelock as Governor, who exercises the power of legislating by proclamation; and native law will remain in force as between natives, and the tribal authority of the chiefs will not be interfered with. Natal law has been proclaimed as having force, as far as applicable, in Zululand, except in certain circumstances for which special laws and regulations are provided. No taxes were collected outside the former Reservo Territory during 1887, but the usual hut-tax of fourteen shillings per annum will henceforth be levied throughout Zululand.

Trade and Industry.

The pursuits of the Zulus are mainly agricultural, crops of maize (mealies), and other cereals being raised round their kraals. Their individual wealth consists in cattle, of which they possess large numbers. They avoid the sea, and have no fishing. Trade is carried on by a few trading settlers, and by traders' waggons from Natal, which traverse the country periodically. Oxen and maize are exchanged for cotton goods and hardware. Gold was discovered in December, 1886, at Mfongosi, near the River Tugela, but the diggings have not proved very remunerative.

No customs or transit dues are at present imposed upon goods entering Zululand. The importation of spirituous liquors is prohibited, except under special permit, and the sale of spirits to natives is forbidden.

By special arrangement between the Natal Government and the administration of Zululand, the latter territory is treated as a part of the Colony of Natal, for the purposes of the Natal Transit Dues Law (1886), under which certain articles pass through the Colony in bond for export beyond the borders on payment of a nominal transit duty.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling, but exchange and the payment of taxes and fines is largely carried on by the transfer of so many cattle. There is as yet no Government savings bank or other bank.

Means of Communication.

The absence of any good landing place prevents communication by sea. St. Lucia Bay is nothing but an exposed and surf-bound beach, affording no harbour. Eshowe is in communication with Natal by telegraph, and by a daily post carried by native runners. A waggon road is being made between Eshowe and Rorke's Drift.

Education.

Education is at present left to the various missionary stations, there being four different societies represented.

Population (estimate) 50,000.

APPENDIX TO PART II.

This Appendix gives some account of certain British Possessions and Protectorates which are not governed as Colonies, but are controlled by High Commissioners or are otherwise in a position of dependency to the British Empire.

BRITISH NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to the Sibuco River on the east coast, together with all the islands within a distance of three leagues, including those of Balabac and Balembangan; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 30,709 square miles, with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 3° 50' to 7° 25' N. lat.

The principal stations of the company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), and Silum on the east, Kudat on the north, Gaya and Mempakol (in Brunei Bay) on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, &c. 200,000 acres have already been alienated on 999 years' cultivation leases.

The mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully investigated. Gold has been found in two of the rivers on the east coast; coal, copper, and other minerals have also been met with, but so far have not been worked.

The country is mountainous, although the shore is flat and fringed with mangrove. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,698 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 200,000, are mainly wandering Dyaks, who remove their villages periodically, and live by hunting and plunder, with occasional attempts at planting and trade. There are Malay and Chinese settlements on the coasts, which cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. Sandakan, the chief town, has a population of 5,000.

History.

The state and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762 at the island of Balembangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and on its failure, the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded the same district to Mr. Alfred Dent, who transferred it to the British North Borneo Company, and some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 93° but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is about 120 inches, chiefly from November to February.

Industry.

Agriculture is in a primitive state, but certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough. The chief products are sago, rice, pepper, tapioca, sweet potatoes, maize and sugar. Tobacco has been grown with success, but regular plantations of any kind are still rare. The main trade is in the products collected in the jungles.

The exports comprise sago, tobacco, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin, mother of pearl shells, pepper, &c.

A timber trade has been opened with both Australia and China.

The Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $40,000. American
dollars and British currency also circulate to some extent. There are no banks, but the Company does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

**Constitution.**

The territory is administered by a court of directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter; and a governor, colonial secretary, and residents appointed by them.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the acts in force in the British colonies, and an Emaum's court, for the administration of Mahommadan law. There is a force of 187 armed police under European officers. A European medical officer is attached to each residency.

**Means of Communication.**

There is frequent communication by steamer with Singapore, and by sailing vessel with Hong Kong, and occasionally visits are made by steamers running between Hong Kong and Australia. There are no railways or telegraphs, and but few roads. Internal communication is mainly by water. The nearest point in telegraphic connection with Europe is Singapore.
