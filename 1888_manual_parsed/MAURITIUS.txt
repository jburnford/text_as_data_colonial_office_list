MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 17' and 57° 46' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 940 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 706 square miles, having an extreme length of 86 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west. The Dependencies have an area of 172 square miles. The only systematic triangulation of Mauritius made until 1875 was that by the celebrated practical astronomer, Abbé de la Caille, who had been sent by the Government of France, in 1753, to determine the latitude and longitude of Mauritius and Bourbon.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude, with peaks rising to nearly 2,700 feet. The highest peak is the Piton de la Rivière-Noire, which is 2,711 English feet, and Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable beyond a few hundred yards from the sea.

History.

The island was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507, but the first people that occupied it in any great numbers were the Dutch, in 1598, whose commander, Admiral J. C. Van Neck, named it Mauritius, in honour of the then Statholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The Dutch, however, though they built a fort at Grand Port, do not appear to have made any permanent settlement, and they finally abandoned the island in 1712. A party of Frenchmen landed there in 1715, and in 1721 it was formally taken possession of by the French, at first on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. The name of the island was then changed by M. Du Fresne, captain in the naval service of France, into that of Isle of France, which it retained till the landing of the English in 1810, when its former name of Mauritius was again restored to it. The most celebrated of the French Governors was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735—1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, and of many other valuable plants, and was the real founder of the prosperity of the island.

Mauritius was during the earlier part of the long war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, from the facility with which sorties were made from it by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810; the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture. The natives are proud of their country, and of the designation of Creoles.

Seven daily newspapers and other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island, except by the Indian population, now over two-thirds of the whole.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.
The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of nearly 70,000 souls. The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The annual trade of the island (including imports and exports), which passes almost entirely through Port Louis, is valued at about seven millions sterling, while the annual public revenue exceeds 700,000L.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Protestant cathedrals, the Royal College, the Town Hall, the theatre, &c.

After Port Louis, the largest town is Curepipe, situated on the uplands in the district of Plaines Wilhems. Its climate is temperate, and many families reside in the numerous villas there during the summer season, while they spend the winter months in Port Louis.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg, so called in honour of M. Mahé de Labourdonnais.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of five officials, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex-officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected on a moderate franchise—two for the town of Port Louis, and one for each of the eight rural districts. At least one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any public office.

**Climate, &c.—** From December to April is the hottest season in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The temperature in the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The climate at Curepipe, 1,800 feet above the sea, resembles that of the South of France. The hurricane season extends from December to the middle of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude. One of the severest hurricanes in this century was that of 1868 (11th and 12th March), when a considerable loss of property and life occurred, and some 50,000 persons were left houseless. The longest days are at the December solstice, and the shortest at the June solstice. The difference of time between Greenwich and the Observatory at Pamplemousses is 3h. 49m. 58s.

**Scenery.**—The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an Engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the last century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

**Railways.**—There are two lines of railway, the North Line and the Midland, both constructed and worked by the Government. The former runs between Port Louis and Grand River, S.E., a distance of 38 miles; the second line runs between Port Louis and Mahebourg, a distance of 35½ miles with branches to Savanne and Moka. The total number of miles of railway now open is 92. At Curepipe the elevation of the railway is 1,822 feet above the sea. The receipts in 1886 were Rs. 1,477,449, and the expenditure Rs. 1,100,847.

Telegraphic communication is established along the railway only, the total length of line being 92 miles.

**Religion.**—The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the last census the Roman Catholics numbered 108,000, and the Protestants 8,000. The Roman Catholics receive Government aid amounting to about 80,000 rupees, the Protestants receive about 45,000 rupees.

**Education.**—The department of public instruction comprises two branches, the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under the control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent, aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported wholly by the State; the grant schools only partially so. The following table shows the numerical strength of each in 1886:

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 65 | 8,026 |
| Grant schools | 75 | 7,766 |
| **Total** | **140** | **15,792** |

The total sum expended on education in 1886 amounted to Rs. 429,432, of which Rs. 266,292 were expended on primary education.

There are about 350 masters and mistresses employed.

Of the pupils in the aided schools 79 per cent. are professedly Roman Catholics, 18 per cent. belong to the Church of England, and 8 per cent. to the Church of Scotland. No assistance is given to Hindu or Mahomedan schools.

**Currency.**—All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is the currency of the island. There are about 10,000,000 Rs. in circulation. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The circulation on the 31st December, 1886, was Rs. 3,382,400.

**Weights and Measures.**—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

**Military Contribution.**—Mauritius pays 40l. per head per annum for each infantry soldier stationed in the colony, and 70l. for engineers, artillerymen, staff, &c. The average strength of the garrison in 1886 was 486 men. The total military expenditure for the year amounted to 44,612 Rs. The contribution of the colony was 211,750 Rs. A sum of 55,000l. was voted in 1886 by the Council of Government for new works of defence in the island.

The total police force on 31st December, 1886, was 684.

**Communications.**—A four-weekly service is carried on by the mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes between New Caledonia and Marseilles, via Suez, touching at Mauritius, Réunion, and Seychelles. The same Company's steamers leave Marseilles every four weeks for New Caledonia, touching at Mauritius. The passage to and from Marseilles averages 21 days. This line receives a subsidy from the Mauritius Government. The Messageries Maritimes Company have also a
monthly service of steamers between Mauritius, Réunion, Madagascar, the Comores Islands, Mozambique, and Zanzibar. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Réunion, &c. Mauritius is not yet connected by telegraph with the rest of the world. The nearest points in cable communication with Europe are Aden, Zanzibar, and Durban.

There are in Mauritius the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 48 branch post offices in the rural districts. In the Seychelles Islands one post office at Victoria, in the island of Mahé; in the island of Rodrigues one post office at Port Mathurin. There is no post office on any other island forming part of the Dependencies of Mauritius. The rates of postage are:

| Countries in Union | Letters per ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|--------------------|------------------|------------|
| South Africa       | 16 cents         | 4 cents    |
| Australasia        | 36 ,,            | 8 ,,       |
|                    | 50 ,,            | 8 ,,       |

Commerce.

The island produces hardly anything for its own consumption, but its foreign commerce extends to every quarter of the globe.

The chief exports are sugar, rum, molasses, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, &c. Oxen are imported from Madagascar, sheep from South Africa and Australia, and breadstuffs from India.

The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware, and manure. There is a small tobacco plantation, but sugar production is the greatest industry. About 90 per cent. of the value of the exports is due to shipments of sugar. In 1886 the weight of sugar exported was 118,000 tons, with an estimated value of Rs. 29,290,180. The value of the rum exported was Rs. 415,828, and that of the cocoa-nut oil Rs. 269,701.

The number of vessels that entered the harbour of Port Louis in 1886 was 497, with a total tonnage of 347,916 tons. The number of vessels registered at the port is now 84, of a total tonnage of 7,995.

Banks.

The following banks have establishments in the colony: The Mauritius Commercial Bank; The New Oriental Bank Corporation; The "Banque Franco-Egyptienne."

A Government savings bank was established in 1865. The total deposits on the 31st December, 1886, amounted to Rs. 3,114,242.

Dependencies.

The numerous dependencies of Mauritius comprise about a hundred islands scattered over the Indian Ocean, and contain a total population of 17,000 inhabitants. They may be roughly divided into four groups, the Seychelles Group, the Amirantes Group, the Oil islands and St. Brandon Group, and detached islands. The Amirantes Group lie between 4° 54' and 6° 13' S. lat., and 53° 27' and 53° 7' E. long. They are coral islands, producing cocoanut oil and a little maize, and some of them are used as fishing stations. The St. Brandon, or Cargados Islands, lie between 16° 20' and 16° 50' S. lat., and 59° 26' and 59° 41' E. long. Most of them are mere sandbanks, and their only produce is a little salt fish. The Chagos Islands, the Trois Frères or Eagle Islands, and the Cosmoledo Islands, which are known generally as the Oil Islands, lie between 6° 40' and 9° 40' S. lat. and 72° 22' and 47° 48' E. long. Amongst the detached islands may be named Assumption, the Aldebra, and the Glorioso Islands, St. Paul Island, and Amsterdam Island, but none of these have any permanent population.

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the total number of acres comprised in this group is 50,120; the distance from Mauritius 940 miles. These islands are under the superintendence of a Chief Civil Commissioner (assisted by a Board of Commissioners) who is appointed by the Secretary of State, but is subordinate to the Governor of Mauritius, from whom he receives his instructions. The population in 1881 was 14,081.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 4 miles broad. It rises abruptly from the sea, and its mountains, in some cases, reach the elevation of 2,000 feet. The capital of the island, now called Victoria, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a commodious and safe harbour.

41 vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 64,990 tons, entered Port Victoria in 1884. The chief exports consist in coconut oil, vanilla, cloves, and cacao.

In the Seychelles group of islands are to be found the celebrated cocos-de-mer. With the leaves of the tree beautiful hats are made by the natives.

Rodrigues, the most important dependency of Mauritius after the Seychelles, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a civil commissioner (who is also a police magistrate), who takes his instructions from the governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the governor of Mauritius in executive council. The population on 3rd April, 1881, was 1,436.

The island, which is mountainous and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good; sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years cultivation has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard-apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and vacoa trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Diego Garcia, the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being...
about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is provided with a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end and from two to five miles in breadth.

Situated as Diego Garcia is, at 7° latitude S. and between 72° and 78° longitude east, on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin, it affords great convenience for coaling purposes to the steamers that cruise in those seas, and coal depots have been established on the island by commercial companies.

In 1885 the island was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius.

**Tariff.**

The customs tariff regulated by Ord. No. 7 of 1878, Schedule A., Ord. 17 and 36 of 1881, Ord. 3 of 1882, Ord. 25 of 1883, Ord. 18 of 1884-85, and Ord. 5, 13 and 16 of 1886, is as follows:
