ANTIGUA

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles.

The islands of Barbuda and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62 square miles.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1498, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1632. In 1668, Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, and Treasurer, are ex officio members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1845, and are as follows:—

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of 11l., or one acre
of land and building value 222l., or tenancy paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 208 voters registered for the whole Island, 130 are registered for the City of St. John.

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council, who in the event of an equality of votes shall have a second or casting vote. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years. The elected members of the Legislative Council of Antigua send four elected members to the General Legislature.

The chief productions are sugar and pineapples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruinate in the hands of the old planting families. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 10,000, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1886, 42 vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 1,118, chiefly engaged in coasting trade.

MONTserrat.

This island, discovered by Columbus in 1498, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua, in 16° 45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 12 miles in length, and 8 in the broadest part; its roads, however, are zigzag, uphill, and down ravine, so that a journey from the town of Plymouth (lying in the centre of the south-west coast) to north or south, exceeds the extreme length of the island. Its total area is 32 square miles. The population of Plymouth is 1,400. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1886, three vessels, of a total tonnage of 98.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants: it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. After undergoing various modifications they became merged in a Legislative Assembly, which lasted down to 1867.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. Her Majesty may from time to time appoint such persons, not exceeding six in all, as she may think fit, to be respectively official, or ex officio and unofficial members of the said Council, every councillor holding office during Her Majesty's pleasure.

The principal export of the island is sugar, which is shipped in tierces and barrels: 3 tierces equal 2 hogsheads. In a very good year the crop yields 2,500 hogsheads. Many sugar works are furnished with steam engines, but there are still some fine properties which rely on the windmill; there are a few cattle mills, and two or three mills are worked by water power.

Within the last twenty years there has been established a valuable staple export, viz., lime juice, raw and concentrated. There are (principally in the northern part of the island) about 1,000 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is extending. It is principally in the hands of the Montserrat Company, Limited.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamized, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

The island is considered to be the most healthy of the Antilles.
