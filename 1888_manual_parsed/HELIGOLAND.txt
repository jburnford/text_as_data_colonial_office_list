HELIGOLAND.

Situation and Area.

Heligoland is an island in the North Sea, in 7° 51' E. long. and 54° 11' N. lat., and about 25 miles from the mouth of the Elbe. Area, inclusive of the adjacent island termed "Sandy," three-quarters of a square mile. The population, as taken at the census of 1881, was 2,001, and is now 2,200. It is the smallest organised British Colony.

History.

Heligoland was surrendered to the British arms in 1807, and formally ceded to Great Britain by Denmark in the Treaty of Kiel, 1814. It was formerly much larger than it now is, in fact the two islands, now nearly a mile apart, formed one up to 1720, when a storm separated them. It is on Sandy Island that the sea bathing, perhaps the finest in the world, takes place.

General Description.

The main island is a red sandstone cliff about 170 feet high, with (but in one spot) inaccessible sides. The town is divided into two parts, the Unterland on the beach containing the Bathing Establishment (hot and swimming baths), Conversations House, Theatre, Coast Guard Barracks, Hotels, &c.; and the Oberland, to which access is now obtained by a flight of 192 steps, and by a lift worked by steam power, containing the largest number of houses, including the church, schools, lighthouse, governor's residence, &c.

From its isolated position Heligoland is wonderfully healthy, its climate being most bracing, equable, and mild, cooler in summer and warmer in winter than either England or the Continent.

From 9,000 to 10,000 visitors generally come over during the bathing season, from May to October, exclusive of excursionists who flock over in large numbers from the neighbouring towns.
Industry.

The Heligolanders formerly existed solely by pilotage and fishing. In 1830, public gaming tables were established, and the island became one of the most fashionable bathing places of North Europe, so that now the inhabitants live mainly by fishing in the winter, and the letting of lodging houses, and the proceeds of the bathing establishment, in summer. The gaming tables were abolished in 1871. Pilotage has almost entirely ceased, the larger vessels fitted out in the Elbe and Weser enabling the pilots from these rivers to go further out to sea to seek for ships. The direct intercourse is entirely with Germany and Denmark. It is a port of registry, and has 47 vessels, the total tonnage being only 463 tons.

Constitution.

Heligoland was governed under its antique Frisian constitution until 1864, when a new and more directly representative form of Government was substituted; but this constitution not having been found to work satisfactorily, the legislative and executive authority were centred in the hands of the Governor, by an Order of Her Majesty in Council bearing date 29th February, 1868. By this Order in Council an Executive Council was established to afford advice to the Governor.

The Governor is judge of the Court of Sessions, and in matrimonial and divorce cases is assisted by the chaplain and Mr. J. G. Bufo.

Religion and Education.

The inhabitants have a pure but unwritten language of their own, and are of Frisian origin. They belong entirely to the German Lutheran Church. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 to 14. 357 children attend the one Government school in the island, and are taught in both the German and English languages.

Customs Tariff.

(Ordinances, 1 of 1878, 1 of 1882, 2 of 1883, and 4 of 1884).

The only imports subject to duty are alcoholic liquors and petroleum. Wine per 40 bottles (anker), of value of 3 marks per bottle, 14 marks; of less value, 10 marks.

Spirits 20 marks on each anker of 37-67 litres, when such spirits do not exceed a strength of 40°, and 5 marks extra for every 10° of additional strength. Beer, per anker, 2 marks 80 pf., per 40 bottles, 3 marks. Petroleum, per kilo. 6 pf. There are no export duties.

Communication.

Connection with the mainland is maintained by steamers leaving Cuxhaven twice a week in winter, and by 29 steamers a week from the neighbouring ports in the summer months. The island is also connected with Cuxhaven by telegraph. Postage to England and other European countries 2½d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post.

Currency and Banking.

Both English and German coins are current and legal tender. There are no private banking establishments, but a Government savings bank was instituted in 1883, and has now £69l. deposited.
