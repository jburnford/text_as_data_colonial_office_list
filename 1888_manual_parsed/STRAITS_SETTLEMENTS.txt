STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict. c. 115.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island about 27 miles long by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 16' north, and long. 103° 53' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 270 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, including the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, is in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed, by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' East.

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent state from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally fell into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bengoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should not again meddle with affairs or have any settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined, and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archi-
pelago not reduced to mercantile subjection by the Dutch; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn declined in importance, as the greater part of the extensive Eastern trade centred at Singapore, and Penang came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon; and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Province Wellesley. It extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 270 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation when compared with the neighbouring territories, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and cocoanuts. In 1806 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1832 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

Singapore Island was taken by the King of Java in 1252, but was abandoned in the 14th century. It remains independent and scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Malayan princes. It was at first subordinate to Bencoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlement.

Native States.

The anarchy prevailing in some states of the Malayan Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was for years a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders. In the beginning of 1874 steps were taken by Sir A. Clarke to remedy this state of things by stationing British residents in Perak and Selangor, and in the small state of Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration. With a view also of enabling the British Authorities to keep order in that part of the Peninsula, a strip of land south of Province Wellesley, about 10 miles broad, beyond the Krian river, has been acquired as British Territory, as well as the territory known as The Dindings, consisting of the island of Pulau Pankor and a small portion of the mainland opposite.

Towards the end of 1875 disturbances arose in the States in question, Mr. J. W. W. Birch, the British Resident at Perak, was murdered, a force sent to apprehend the murderers was resisted; and, at the same time the Residency in Sungei Ujong was menaced by bodies of Malays from some of the States near Malacca.

Under the prompt and energetic measures taken by the Governor, Sir W. Jervois, these outbreaks were suppressed in the course of about two months.

After the military occupation of Perak, those concerned in the murder of Mr. Birch were captured and punished, some of the chiefs being banished to the Seychelles. In Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, Residents have been appointed, who are assisted by a staff of European officers, and it is their duty to aid the native rulers by advice, and to carry out certain executive functions delegated to them. The supreme authority in each state is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native authorities and the principal English officials. The Residents are directly under the Governor of the Straits Settlements.

Licences and customs, of which latter the duty on the export of tin is the most important, form the revenue of these States. The country, however, is otherwise rich, and offers great advantages for the cultivation of coffee, cinchona, tea, &c., on its high lands, and of paddy in the valleys. Since the war the increase among the Chinese has been very great. Sir F. Weld consolidated the relations with the unprotected States in the neighbourhood of Malacca, and the Colonial Government is assisting them with loans for the construction of roads and stations. The total population of these territories is estimated at 200,000. The latest statistics are given in the following tables:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1886 | $1,688,276 | $1,465,325 |
| Selangor | 689,401 | 683,876 |

Debt, Selangor, $502,650; S. Ujong, $125,358.

In addition to the above States, the Sultan of Johore has placed, in the spirit of former treaties, his foreign relations in the hands of this country, and has agreed to receive a British Consular Agent.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The government of the Straits Settlements consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council: the latter body comprising 10 official members and 7 unofficial nominated members.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and the English Acts and Orders in Council which apply to the Colony, and in Indian Acts. The Indian Penal Code with slight alterations has been adopted, and there is a civil procedure code based on the English Judicature Acts.

There is a Supreme Court, with assizes at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, and monthly civil sessions, subject to appeals to Singapore.

Defence.

The Military Force consists of two batteries of Royal Artillery, one Battalion of an Infantry Regiment, of which two Companies are stationed at Penang, and the remainder at Singapore, and a detachment of Royal Engineers.

Singapore harbour is defended by batteries just completed, to be armed with heavy ordnance.

Population.

A census was taken in the Colony on the 3rd April, 1881. The following figures give the numbers in the several settlements:

| Settlement | Population |
|------------|------------|
| Singapore | 139,208 |
| Penang | 90,951 |
| Province Wellesley | 97,824 |
| Malacca | 93,579 |
| The Dindings | 2,922 |

Total | 428,584 |
Estimated, 1886 | 500,000 |
The following are the chief statistics of the census:

Trade.

The Straits ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping entering the port is liable, consists of a very moderate one, of 2 cents or 1d. per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in our own territories are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); rice (in Prov. Wellesley and Malacca), and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, and the Dutch Indies. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had on the 31st December, 1886, 315 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 30,471.

The value of the united exports and imports of the three Settlements in 1859-60 was 14,821,300L; in 1886 it had increased to 40,431,758L.*

There is no railway in the Colony proper, but Larut (Perak) is connected with the sea by a line of light railway, and another line is being constructed in Selangor, from the river port of Klang, 20 miles inland, to the town of Kuala Lumpor, along which route a telegraph line is already open.

Education.

There is no law establishing elementary education, and there are no endowments. The requisite sum to meet the expenditure on education is voted each year by the Legislative Council of the Colony. The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Inspector of Schools.

Instruction in Malay is provided for Malays, and this is free. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Govern-
ment are unsectarian, and there is no compulsory education.

The number of schools and scholars is as follows:

| Type of School                  | No. of Schools | Attendance |
|---------------------------------|---------------|------------|
| Government English schools     | 8             | 1,462      |
| Government Malay schools       | 156           | 4,160      |

| Private English schools        | 1             | 42         |
| Private vernacular schools     | 137           | 2,271      |

Total: 832 schools, 11,854 attendance.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency consists of Spanish, Mexican, Peruvian, Bolivian, and Hong Kong silver dollars, with local silver and copper coins of smaller denominations; the amount of coin in circulation is estimated at six million dollars.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London; and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (amount of deposits, 1885, $2,000,000), and the New Oriental Bank Corporation, Limited.

They all issue notes, to the extent of nearly four and a-half million dollars in the aggregate.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement, having on 31st December, 1886, due to depositors $77,818.

Tasmania.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide: the important gold-producing colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. The surface is diversified by ranges of hills and valleys, with occasionally large plains.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Dieman's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1850. Responsible government was introduced in 1854.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for outdoor occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian colonies.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1886 the mean heat of spring was $55^\circ$F, summer $61^\circ$F, autumn $54^\circ$F, winter $46^\circ$F, of the whole year $54^\circ$F. Rain fell on 189 days in the year, and the rainfall is a little more than 21 inches.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,772 miles of telegraph (with 2,353 miles of wire) open in the colony. This includes 359 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph construction up to 31st Dec., 1886, was £164,982, the receipts in 1886 being £19,793, and the working expenses £20,327.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Hobart and Launceston twice and sometimes thrice a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every fortnight. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Galle and London every two weeks, time 42 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 60 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Singapore, and Galle every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 70 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the Shaw Saville Line of steamers, one of which calls at Hobart every month.

There are 251 places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

| Letters per oz. | Newspapers |
|----------------|------------|
| Within a town   | 1d.        | free       |
| Australasia     | 2d.        |            |
| Europe, United States | 6d.    |            |

Area.

The island contains 15 million acres of land, and the islands connected with it contain 14 million acres: 4,513,454 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown; leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 12,264,546 acres, of which 1,106,111 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in Bass' Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, Robbins Island, King Island, and Brenir Island on the east coast.

Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government: all the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1886 the maintenance of main roads cost £19,838, of cross and bye roads £14,277.

Railways.

There are now 447 miles of railway in the colony constructed or in course of construction, mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. 303 miles of these are opened for traffic, and 142 miles in course of construction.

A line of 126 miles is worked by the Tasmanian Main Line Company; the colony guaranteeing to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on a sum not exceeding £60,000 for 30 years. The total cost of railway construction up to 31st Dec., 1886, was £2,213,781, the gross receipts in 1886 being £131,935, and the working expenses £114,706.
Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is £1 an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than £5 an acre.

Any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at £1 an acre, with 38 per cent. for credit, payable by quarterly instalments for 14 years.

When 500 acres shall have been sold in not less than 10 lots adjoining or close to each other, the Governor in Council is empowered to raise a sum not exceeding half of such purchase money for the purpose of constructing a road or roads in the vicinity of the lots. Credit is allowed on all purchases above £15.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of tin and gold produced in 1886 was—tin, 409,487l.; gold, 117,250l.

The land in cultivation on 31st March, 1887, was 446,391 acres. There were in the colony 148,665 horned cattle, and 1,609,046 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1886 was 8,175,780 lb., valued at 310,934l.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, some of which are now being turned to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, and iron of the finest quality has been produced from them. Tin in immense quantities has been discovered at Mount Bischoff, the whole mountain being said to be intersected with veins of that ore. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper, silver, and antimony have also been found, the copper yielding 30 per cent. of metal. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1886, 200 vessels, of 17,424 aggregate tonnage.

Population.

On 3rd April, 1881, the population of Tasmania was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females. The death-rate of 1881 was 14·77 to the 1,000 of the population, but for 1868-73 it was only 14 per 1,000. The number of inhabited houses is 21,868. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds. The estimated population, 31st December, 1886, was 137,211.

Hobart is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1886) within the Registration boundary 29,987 inhabitants.

Launceston, the second town of the colony, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 18,628 persons, and is rapidly progressing.

Local Government.

Municipal councils were established in Hobart and Launceston in 1855, when responsible government was granted to the Colony, and under the Rural Municipalities Act of 1865, councils have been established in 21 districts. These councils consist of seven elected members, two retiring annually for two successive years and three every third year. The president of the council, called the Warden, is elected annually by the councillors. The voters for the election of councillors are every male or female over 21 years of age on the assessment roll. In the districts where there are no municipalities the care of the roads is in the hands of Road Trusts. In Launceston, Hobart, Misery, Circular Head, and Table Cape, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies in 1886 was 156,044l., and the expenditure 158,227l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are five banks established in the Colony, viz.: The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with, together, 28 branches. The total deposits on 31st December, 1886, amounted to 4,325,721l. The note circulation on same date amounted to 149,511l.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the colony, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department; total deposits at time of last balancing being 429,089l.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1886 the Board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a director of education, working under the chief secretary as ministerial head. The system is national and compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 194 state schools in operation on 31st December, 1885, the number of scholars on the rolls 15,418, and the average attendance 7,465.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and liberal course of education amongst the youth of the colony, the Council of Education was established on the 5th of November, 1858, with power to grant the degree of Associate of Arts; and scholarships were endowed to enable the more proficient youths to pursue their studies in a University of the United Kingdom. In all 27 scholarships and exhibitions are now awarded.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17): by this Act a Legislative Council and House of Assembly are constituted, called "the Parliament of Tasmania."

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 20l. or leasehold of 80l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, elected for twenty-eight electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly...
is five years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to have his name included in the assessment roll of the district for which his vote is to be given as the owner or occupier of any property, or to be in receipt of income of £6l. sterling per year, for 6 months prior to 1st November in any year. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict., No. 32. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for four months.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

Defence.

The strength of the Colonial Volunteer Force is 736 officers and men.
