VICTORIA.

Position.

Victoria is situated at the south-east of the Continent of Australia, and lies between the 34th and 39th parallels of south latitude and the 141st and 150th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 490 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

Victoria was separated from New South Wales in 1851. On the north and north-east it is bounded by that Colony, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from the head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass' Straits, and the Pacific Ocean.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 570 miles, and by land 574 miles; from Adelaide by sea 482 miles, and by land 575 miles. It is now connected both with Sydney and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, via Ceylon and Suez, is maintained weekly by the steamers of the P. and O., alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India, and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The rates of postage are:

Area.

The area of Victoria is, according to the most recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 56,245,760 acres. The whole continent of Australia contains 2,944,628 square miles, and Victoria consequently occupies about a thirty-fourth part of its surface. Great Britain, exclusive of the islands in the British seas, contains 88,006 square miles, and is therefore slightly larger than Victoria.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57°4', the mean atmospheric pressure at 91-8 feet above the sea level was 29-98 inches; rain falls on the average upon 130 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 25-46 inches.

Industry.

The number of acres under cultivation in 1886-87 was 2,417,582.

Wheat produced in Victoria in 1886-87 was 12,100,036 bushels; oats, 4,256,079 bushels; potatoes, 170,961 tons; hay, 483,049 tons. The Victorian wool produced in 1885 amounted to about 58,390,100 lbs., valued at 2,960,890l.

The total quantity of gold raised from the date of the first discovery (1861) to the end of the year 1886, is estimated at 54,893,000 ozs., which at 4l. per oz. gives the value as 217,572,000l.

According to the returns of 1886-7, there are 308,558 horses in the colony; 1,303,265 horned cattle; 10,700,408 sheep; and 240,597 pigs.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The manufactories and works returned in 1887 numbered 2,785, the hands employed therein numbered 45,773; and the capital invested, so far as it is represented by the value of lands, buildings, machinery, and plant, amounted to 11,028,158l.

There are 1,753 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. There were also 816 more miles in course of construction. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1886, was 28,377,500l. The revenue for 1885-6 was 2,329,126l.; and the expenditure 1,310,588l.

There are 4,094 miles of telegraph lines open, and 10,111 miles of wire.

Stage-coaches run to all parts of the Colony where railway communication is not available.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city in Australasia, having, with its suburbs, in 1887, an estimated population of 371,630. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

By the Chinese Act, 1881, a tax of 10l. per head is levied on Chinese immigrants.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering 419 in all, throughout the Colony on the 31st December, 1886: the Bank of Australasia, the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank of Victoria, City of Melbourne Bank, Colonial Bank of Australasia, Commercial Bank of Australia, English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank, Federal Bank of Australia, London Chartered Bank of Australia, National Bank of Australia, and the Union Bank of Australia.

The deposits at that date amounted to 31,289,472l., and the value of the notes in circulation to 1,399,208l.

There are also 269 Post Office and ordinary Savings Banks throughout the Colony. The number of accounts open at the end of the year 1886 was 196,000, and the amount on deposit was about 3,431,000l. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of about 3,000,000l. is coined annually.

Education.

Educational establishments in Victoria are of three classes, viz., the University, with its two affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education, and private schools for both primary and secondary education. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognized in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are two
Colleges—Trinity and Ormond—connected with the Church of England and the Presbyterian Church respectively. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1885 was 444. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1885, the total number of students who matriculated was 2,241, and 774 direct degrees were conferred during the same period.

The system of primary public instruction which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. With certain exceptions, it is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 15, and it is free for the ordinary course of instruction. In 1886 there were 1,864 State schools, with a total enrolment of 280,576 scholars, instructed by about 4,200 teachers. The average attendance was about 121,000. In 1885–6 the amount expended in public instruction was £86,124l. There is no local control over the schools, and the teachers are paid partly by a fixed salary, and partly by results.

The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. There were in 1886 665 private schools in Victoria, with 1,645 teachers, and an attendance of 35,000 scholars. Of these schools, the Roman Catholic denomination had 182, with 527 teachers and 20,300 scholars.

Australian Federal Council.

Victoria has taken a leading part in promoting the Federation of the Australasian Colonies, and was mainly instrumental in procuring the passing of the "Federal Council Act of Australasia" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act creates a Council of two members from each Colony, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which have only one member each, with power to Her Majesty to increase the number of representatives from any Colony by Order in Council. This Council has power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, service of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they have been passed, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two Colonies may also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and joint stock companies; but legislation of the Council on such matters is not to take effect in any Colony until adopted by its legislature. It has also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent.

The Council is to meet at least once in every two years. The first meeting took place at Hobart, on 26th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed extending the operation of warrants and judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits.

The Council met for its second session on 16th Jan., 1888, and adjourned on the 19th.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Ministry. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper House of Parliament, consisting of 42 members elected for fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly, or Lower House, consisting of 86 members returned by 55 Electoral Districts. The Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the Imperial Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returns for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years, so that the tenure of seats is six years. The Governor has no power to dissolve the Council. The property qualification of Members is possession of freehold property of an annual value of £100. The property qualification of Electors of Members of Council is possession of freehold property rated in some municipal district at not less than 10l. per annum, or occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not less than a 25l. annual rating. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council. The functions of this House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. The duration of the Assembly is under ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, except such as are in receipt of official salary out of the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 300l. a year "for reimbursing their expenses in relation to their attendance in Parliament." Members of seven years' standing are allowed free passes for life over Government Railways. The Members of the Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend over 86,391 square miles, comprising nearly the whole area of the Colony. Each district is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. The governing body is a Council, the Members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Rates may be levied on all land within a municipality except that used for public purposes, for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound (the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by the Municipal Council. In 1886 there were 59 cities, towns, and boroughs, and 125 shires. The number of ratepayers was 251,057; the annual value of the rateable property was assessed at 9,621,135l., representing a value in fee simple of 125,878,748l.; the total income (including 371,594l. received from Government) was 1,280,737l., and the expenditure was 1,268,954l.
The harbour of Melbourne is under the control of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act in 1887. The revenue of the Trust in 1886 was £149,479, and its expenditure £271,611. The debt of the Trust at the end of 1885 amounted to £750,000, and the debts of the various municipalities to £1,229,203; an aggregate local indebtedness of £1,979,203.

Defences.

The land forces at the end of 1886 comprised an establishment of 3,885 men of all arms, of whom 186 were officers. 265 were wanting to complete.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 514 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship "Cerberus," the wooden frigate "Nelson," the gun-boats "Victoria" and "Albert," the torpedo boats "Childers" (first class), "Nepean," and "Lonsdale" (second class), the torpedo launches "Commissioner," "Customs No. 1," and "Gordon," the Harbour Trust dredges "Batman," "Fawkner," "Gannet," and the steam patrol boats "Lion" and "Spray," and the steel Customs steamer, "Lady Loch."

WEST AFRICA SETTLEMENTS.
(SIERRA LEONE AND GAMBIA.)

See Map.

The Colony of the West Africa Settlements was formed in 1866, by the union of the Settlements of the Gambia, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast and Lagos. The latter two Settlements were excluded in 1874, and formed into a separate government, now subdivided.

The establishment of the Colony consists of a Governor-in-Chief, and a Chief Justice. The seat of government is Freetown, Sierra Leone. There is one Court of Appeal for the whole Colony. There is, however, no common legislature, treasury, or tariff, and the administrations of the two Settlements are quite separate.
