THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, were by the Imperial Act 30 Vic., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 27th of May, 1867. The essential provisions of this Act are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vic., cap. 3.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16 May, 1871, issued under the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that province was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was incorporated by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada, from the 1st of Sept., 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the Queen, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The seat of government, until the Queen shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 80 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, and has been raised by additions on the accession of new provinces and by the increase in population to 215; 92 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 21 Nova Scotia, 16 New Brunswick, 5 Manitoba, 6 British Columbia, 6 Prince Edward Island, and 4 The Territories. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. Each member of the Senate receives $1,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons $10 a day during the session, with a maximum of $1,000 per session.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials. The provincial seats of government are Toronto (Ontario), Quebec (Quebec), Halifax (Nova Scotia), Fredericton (New Brunswick), Winnipeg (Manitoba), Victoria (British Columbia), Charlottetown (Prince Edward Island) and Regina (North West Territories).
Each province (except the North-West Territories) has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The provincial legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. In the North-West Territories there is only an "Executive Council," which now includes, however, 14 elected to 7 nominated members, and an additional elected member is added as each district of 1,000 square miles attains 1,000 enfranchised inhabitants.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the provincial legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and naturalisation, and native affairs.

The powers of the provincial legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior district and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the Probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, according to the census of 1861, except that the subsidy of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia is to increase each census till the population in each case reach 400,000. Each Province also receives an annual allowance for Government, and for interest on the amount by which its debt at the Union fell short of the authorised amount.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislatures require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed by the Queen.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans. Both these have now been opened.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In Ontario the system is to be found in the most complete and symmetrical form, towards which the others closely approximate. The organization comprises (1) townships or rural districts of 8 or 10 square miles with a population of 3 to 6,000, administered by a reeve and 4 councillors; (2) villages with a population of 750, governed like the township; (3), towns with a population over 2,000, governed by the mayor and 3 councillors for each ward if there are less than five wards, and 2 councillors if more than five. The reeves, deputy reeves, mayors, and councillors are all elected annually by the ratepayers. Above these stands the county municipality consisting of the reeves and deputy reeves of the townships, villages, and towns within the county, one of these who presides being called "Warden" of the county. Alongside the county stands the "city" with a population of over 15,000, governed by a municipal body of mayor and 3 aldermen for every ward, with powers and functions akin to those of counties and towns combined. The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent, stretching from latitude 42 to the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,470,257 square miles, exclusive of the great lakes and rivers. The greater part of this is comprised in the North West Territory. The seven settled Provinces of the Dominion comprise about 834,687 square miles.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1882 was as follows:

| Year | Yield |
|------|-------|
| 1882 | 16,824,092 |
| 1883 | 17,215,675 |
| 1884 | 17,766,404 |

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is estimated at 60,000.

Tonnage of vessels on Register Books of the Dominion: 31st December, 1886, was 1,217,766 tons, of which sailing ships were 959,948 tons, and steamers 257,818. The number of seamen employed was about 140,000. Canada stands fifth on the list of nations in respect of tonnage, France standing sixth, and Italy seventh.

Education.

Education is one of the matters reserved for the control of the Provincial Governments, except that the Royal Military College at Kingston and the Infantry Schools are under the Dominion Government, acting through the Department of Militia. Particulars as to elementary education will be found in the accounts of the respective provinces.

Railways.

The length of railways actually constructed in the Dominion on 30th June, 1886, was 11,620 miles, Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems. The total capital invested amounted to $653,759,944 on 30th June, 1886. The total quantity of goods carried amounted to 15,661,086 tons. The number of passengers was 9,658,791, and the distance travelled by trains was 30,481,088 miles. The total receipts were $38,385,269, and working expenses $23,802,482.

The Dominion Government own and maintain 1,190 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $49,260,380. The working expenses in 1886 were $2,819,978, and the receipts $2,629,336.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are now running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and the establishment of a new Mail Service over this route is under the consideration of the Imperial Government.

Telegraphs.

There are about 25,400 miles of telegraph line, and 50,846 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 3,144 are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 5,577,684 messages were sent in 1886 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 2,632, being one to every 1,821 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain and Newfoundland, and also a deep sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States.

Militia.

The Canadian Militia for some years past has been under the immediate command of a Lieut-General of the English Army. The Dominion is divided, for military purposes, into twelve districts, with a Deputy Adjutant-General, and a Brigade Staff in charge of each. The active Militia numbers 38,000 men, and the reserve Militia consists of the men who are not serving in the active Militia.

There are included in this force 45 batteries of garrison artillery, and 18 of field artillery, and 43 troops of cavalry. There are three royal schools of gunnery, one school of cavalry, and four of infantry, and the Dominion Government in 1875 established a school of scientific military instruction at Kingston, known as "The Royal Military College," presided over by Col. J. R. Oliver, R.A.

II. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497; but this is not certain. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days, and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonization were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1620 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by one Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774, Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were allowed the free exercise of their religion: the Catholic Clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same. The effect of this liberality was made manifest upon the occasion of the American Civil War, when the newly acquired, and then mainly Catholic province of Canada, remained loyal to England in spite of seductive overtures from the revolted Colonies.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), dividing Canada into two Provinces, upper Canada (now Ontario) and lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act of Parliament in question, the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1838. The most fruitful causes of dissension were the right of the Assembly to control public expenditure, and the question of the "Clergy Reserves," lands appropriated by the Imperial Act of 1791 for the exclusive benefit of the Anglican Clergy. The immediate exciting cause of the Rebellion was the establishing, by Governor Sir John Colborne, of 37 rectories in Upper Canada. After the reduction of the insurgents, the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by an Act, 3rd and 4th Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. The new House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal proportion returned by either Province. In the same year (1840) also, Municipal Institutions were established in Canada.

The Provincial Legislature was empowered by Act 17 & 18 Vic., cap. 118 (1854), to constitute the Legislative Council an elective body.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 members who were elected, and 22 members who were nominated under the old constitution.

In 1855 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having almost come to a "dead lock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in council, advised by five or more cabinet ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 90 members; Quebec 60 members), elected by
manhood suffrage. Quebec possesses also an Upper House in the form of a Legislative Council of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in council.

Industry.

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. The cattle and meat trade is also assuming considerable proportions, large exports of this kind being shipped annually to England. The same remark applies to dairy produce.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for the elementary (public) schools, of which there are 5,375, with 466,917 scholars, and for the secondary (high) schools, which number 106, and contain 12,737 scholars. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational), university with an affiliated university college, and three theological colleges are also affiliated. There are also five denominational colleges with university powers in the province, and numerous high class schools or colleges for girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well equipped agricultural college. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There are 4,000 schools, with nearly 200,000 scholars. There are nearly 300 secondary and model schools, with 40,000 pupils, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation and Area.

Nova Scotia, now a part of the Dominion, is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., and is connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea; deducting this one-fifth part and the land unsuited for agricultural purposes, there are rather more than 5,000,000 acres of land fit for tillage. Grants of 100 acres can be obtained for about 9l., and improved farms are to be purchased at moderate prices.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander by James I. in 1627. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of the province.

Description.

The harbour of Halifax has an area of about 10 square miles, is open at all seasons, and its navigation is scarcely ever interrupted by ice. This harbour is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for, it is said, 1,000 ships. The British Government has an extensive dockyard at Halifax, which is its principal naval station in North America.

The climate is remarkably healthy, and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion, but fogs prevail on the coast. The health returns from British military stations place this province in the first class. The greatest heat observed at Halifax by Captain Moorsom was 95° Fahr., and the extreme cold 10°.

The forests of Nova Scotia abound in good timber—the ash, the beech, the birch, the maple, the oak, the pine, and the spruce being the most common trees.

Coal and iron ore are plentiful, and gold also has been discovered, and is yielding fair returns; but the greater portion of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the growth of fruit. The superior fisheries, together with the ship-building and timber trades, give occupation to many.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 21 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected by the people every four years.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1886 there were 2,000 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 105,410 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

The total cost of education is $650,000.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation and Area.

New Brunswick, now part of the Dominion, is situated between 45° 5' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 47' and 67° 53' W. long.; its area is about 27,105 square miles, or 17,000,000 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus.

History.

New Brunswick, in the early part of the last century, belonged to the French, and was called by them New France. At the peace of 1763, New Brunswick, with the rest of Canada, was ceded by France to Great Britain, and was annexed to Nova Scotia until 1785, when it was erected into a separate Colony. It was first colonized by British subjects in 1761, and in 1783 by disbanded troops from New England.

Industries.

Coal is abundant; antimony, iron, and gypsum are to be found also in very large quantities. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river.

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 12 Members, and sends 16 Members to the House of Commons.

There is also a Legislative Council of 18 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 41 members.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 5 and 20. There were 1,508 schools, with 57,068 scholars in average attendance, in 1888, and the total cost of elementary education in that year amounted to:—

| Provincial assessment | $159,243 |
|-----------------------|----------|
| County fund           | 94,508   |
| Local assessment      | 450,000 (about) |

MANITOBA.

Situation and Area.
Manitoba was erected into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 38 Vic., c. 8, taking effect
from the 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined. It is declared to be bounded on the south by the 49th degree of latitude, on the north by the 50° 30' latitude, on the west by the 99th parallel of W. longitude, and on the east by the 96th parallel of E. longitude.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and the boundaries of the province were fixed at 49°-53° N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 60,520 square miles, with a population in 1885 of 108,640.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, fearing that they would be subject to a possibly stricter form of Government, rose in insurrection, and established a provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada. In September, 1870, Mr. A. G. Archibald assumed the administration of the Government.

In October, 1871 the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid. Mr. Archibald, isolated, and without the aid of troops, took measures for its defence, and with this view accepted the co-operation of Riel and Lepine. The attack never took place.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence for two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights, chiefly in view of the acceptance of his services by Lieut.-Governor Archibald, as above stated.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of this province are very highly spoken of. The soil is a rich black loam. The growth of Winnipeg, the chief city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants. In 1881 it had a population of about 10,000, and now has about 25,000.

For some years the province could only be reached by railway through the United States territory, but in 1881 that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg was opened, the benefit of which it is difficult to calculate, and in 1886 the whole line was completed.

The free-grant lands are almost all taken up, but good farms can be purchased at from $2 to $10 per acre. The area occupied in 1885 was 4,171,224 acres.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by three members in the Dominion Senate and five in the House of Commons. It had also an assembly of thirty members, but by the new Redistribution Act, the number has been increased to thirty-five. The Legislative Council, or Upper Chamber, was abolished by Act 28 of 1876.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control is in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively, and the local management is entrusted to school trustees elected by the people. Education is free, unsectarian, and compulsory between the ages of five and sixteen. There are 580 schools, with a total of 20,000 scholars, and an average attendance of about 14,000; the cost of education in 1886 was about $400,000 from local sources and $66,000, from legislative grant.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers, and in 1887 provision was made for establishing intermediate and high schools, which has since been carried into effect by the establishment of three high and eight intermediate schools in connection with Protestant public schools.

There is one university, styled the University of Manitoba, with examining and degree conferring powers only. The affiliated Colleges are S. John's (Episcopal), S. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), and the Manitoba Medical College.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Coast, bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, and on the south by the United States—the average breadth being about 250 miles, and the length of coast line 450 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 350,000 square miles.

The geographical position of British Columbia is very important, jutting out from North America as Great Britain juts out from Europe. The comparatively favourable distances across the ocean to Japan, China, and Australia, the direction of the trade winds, the inexhaustible stores of coal, the immense fertile regions through which the Canadian Pacific Railway reaches the seaboard, linking the Pacific Ocean to the system of the St. Lawrence navigation or the eastern side of the American continent, are facts extremely favourable to the growth of a widely-extended commerce.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate and six in the House of Commons of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a lieutenant-governor and legislative assembly of twenty-seven members on the system of executive administration known as a "Responsible Government."

Description.

The population is about 80,000, of whom 30,000 or more are Indians, and at least 9,000 Chinese.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains: the climate is for the most part drier, and the snow falls consequently less.

Agricultural operations have been greatly extended during the past five years, and have proved the character of the land throughout the province to be admirably adapted for the culture of cereals, while large tracts of good grazing land exist in the interior.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; the exports amount to nearly four millions annually (a remarkable fact considering the number of the population); they consist of minerals (chiefly gold and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon and oil), timber, furs, skins, &c. The imports amount to two and a half millions, principally from Eastern Canada, England, the United States, China, &c. The exports in the years 1886-7 were $8,466,467, and the exports $3,532,684.

The province has produced over fifty million dollars of gold, and although the production or 1886 (over $900,000) is less than in some former years, it is expected that the prosecution of quartz mining, now in its infancy, will, in the near future be a most important industry.

The lumber trade is fast attaining large dimensions, the shipments from the two principal mills, during 1886, amounting to over 30,000,000 feet. Timber is abundant in all parts of the province.

The waters of the province teem with food fishes; besides salmon and herrings there are large quantities of cod, including common and black cod, bass, flounders, skate, sole, halibut, sardines, and oysters. Whales are numerous, and the capture of the fur seal is an important industry.

To the sportsmen and anglers British Columbia is attractive. The game in the more settled districts consist of grouse, ptarmigan, quail, duck, snipe, &c.; and in the wilder parts mountain sheep and goat, cariboo, elk, bear, &c., abound.

Education.

A complete system of free common school education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in a Superintendent of Education, acting under the Provincial Secretary, and the local management is in the hands of three trustees, elected annually by the people in each school district. Education is free and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 12 inclusive. There are 98 schools with 2,878 pupils in average attendance. The total cost of education for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1887 was over $100,000.

The schools are free and non-sectarian; school districts being formed wherever there are fifteen pupils between the ages of six and sixteen.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.
This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long.; its area is about 1,380,000 acres; it is about 140 miles long, and 84 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to the Government of Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1770.

Description.
The climate is milder than in the surrounding British Colonies, and it is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Abundance of sea manure can be obtained along the shores, and in some districts in the interior rich fertilizing material is to be found in certain swamps and marshes.

All kinds of grain, vegetables, &c., ordinarily grown in Britain reach the greatest perfection, and although seed time is later, growth is so rapid that harvest is quite as early as there.

The province has acquired a high reputation for certain useful classes of horses.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, &c.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The revenue and expenditure of the island are on an average about $260,000 a year each; and there is direct taxation, with the exception of statute labour on the roads, or commutation money therefor, in the country, and municipal rates in
the towns. The chief towns are Charlottetown (18,000), and Sommerset (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island.

**Constitution.**

Responsible Government was established at Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General of Canada, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) composed of 9 members, a Legislative Council of 13 members, and a House of Assembly of 30 members. Both these bodies are elected by the people.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of these elects ten representatives and four councillors to the Local Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and six in the House of Commons.

**Education.**

A system of elementary education was established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a Chief Superintendent. Education is free, non-secretarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 485 schools, with 31,988 scholars, with an average attendance of 12,166, and the total cost of elementary education in 1885 was $14,559,860.

The North West Territories.

By a Canadian Act, 88 Vic., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North Western Territory (with the exception of such portion thereof as forms the Province of Manitoba), were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. This Act was amended and consolidated by 48 Vic. cap. 25. The territories are governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, assisted by a Council (partly nominated and partly elected), subject to instructions given by Order in Council at Ottawa, or by the Secretary of State of Canada. Representatives may be returned from time to time to the Council Assembly according as districts containing an area of 1,000 square miles attain a population of not less than 1,000 inhabitants of adult age, exclusive of aliens or unenfranchised Indians. The population of the Territories is increasing very rapidly, as is instanced by the large increase in number of elected members in the N.W. Council mentioned below. In 1881 there was only one elected member in the North-West Council; in 1883 there were 6, in 1884-7, and now (October, 1887) there are 14. Four members are returned to the Dominion Parliament.

Elementary education is provided for by a Board of Education, empowered by the School Ordinance, 1885. School districts can be organised in areas not exceeding thirty-six square miles, where there are at least four heads of families, and a population of at least ten children of school age. School districts are administered by three trustees elected by the residents. Liberal aids are given to school districts on behalf of (1) Teachers' certificates, according to their grade; (2) average attendance of pupils; (3) results of an annual inspection of the school; (4) additional teachers employed in large schools. The number of public schools in operation are 102 Protestant and 21 Roman Catholic, and 4 public. A high school system is being provided for.

The Territories were divided in 1882 into four provisional districts; viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. Regina (the capital) is in the district of Assiniboia. The boundaries of these districts are as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52, on the west by longitude 110, and on the south by latitude 49.

Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 110.

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by British Columbia.

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 110 and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to the Territories also. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that the Territories have over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.

In March, 1885, an outbreak occurred among the half-breeds in the North Saskatchewan district under the leadership of Louis Riel, who organised the Red River rebellion in 1870. The alleged grievances were the delay in granting titles to the land, and the system of survey that had been adopted. A commission had been appointed in the previous January to inquire into the matter, and it was about to commence its work when the rising took place. A few hundreds of the half-breeds joined Riel, but, notwithstanding strenuous exertions, he could only induce a small number of the Indians to help him. The remainder were thoroughly loyal. Troops consisting of the volunteer militia of the various provinces were despatched under the command of Major-General Middleton, C.B., within a few days of the skirmish between the North-West Mounted Police and the rebels at Duck Lake on March 16 becoming known, and they were conveyed by the Canadian Pacific Railway to Qu'Appelle, within 200 miles of the disaffected district, in about a week. General Middleton at once commenced his march to the North Saskatchewan River with the main body of his command, and despatched also a force under Colonel Otter to relieve Battleford, where Indian troubles were expected. The first engagement was at Fish Creek on April 24. Colonel Otter also attacked the Cree Indians under Chief Poundmaker on May 2. The subsequent encounters at Batoche, on May 9 and 11, ended the rebellion. Riel was taken prisoner on May 15, was tried at Regina in July, and was sentenced to be hanged on September 18. He appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench in Manitoba, and subsequently to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; and to admit of the appeal being heard respites were granted. The Council advised Her Majesty to dismiss the petition, and Riel was executed on November 16. Several Indians were also hanged at Battleford on November 27, after having been tried and sentenced for murders they had committed during the rising. The gallantry displayed by the Canadian Militia has been spoken of in terms of praise by the general in command, and Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to issue a medal to those who took part in the expedition.
