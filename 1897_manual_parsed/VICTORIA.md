VICTORIA.

Situation and Area.

Victoria is situated at the south-east continent of Australia, and lies between the 39th parallels of south latitude and the 145th meridians of east longitude. Its extreme length from east to west is about 300 miles, and its greatest breadth is about 300 miles. Its extent of coast line is nearly 700 miles.

On the north, and north-east Victoria is bounded by New South Wales, from which it is separated by the river Murray, and a direct line from head waters of that stream, at Forest Hill, to Cape Howe. On the west it is bounded by Australia, from which it is separated by a line approximating to the position of the 141st meridian extending from the Murray to the sea. On the south and south-east its shores are washed by the Southern Ocean, Bass Straits, and the Pacific.

The southernmost point in Victoria, and the whole continent of Australia, is Wilson's Point, which lies in latitude 39° 8' S., longitude 146° 26' E.; the northernmost point is that where the western boundary of the colony, the Murray, latitude 34° 2' S., longitude 146° 38' E.; the point furthest east is Cape Howe, situated at latitude 37° 31' S., longitude 149° 59' E.; the most westerly point is the line of the western frontier, which, according to the latest correction, lies upon the meridian 140° 58' E., or 242 geographical miles.

The area of Victoria is, according to the recent computation, 87,884 square miles, or 50,245,760 acres (nearly equal to Great Britain). The whole continent of Australia contains 2,916,000 square miles, and Victoria consequently owns about a thirty-fourth part of its surface.

Physical Features.

Victoria is traversed, with more or less regularity, throughout its entire length from east to west by a chain of mountains and lesser ranges, completely dividing it into two parts, such as the Dividing Range. The summit of this range runs generally at a distance of 60 or 70 miles from the coast. The streams to the north of it run towards the River Murray, and those to the south towards the sea. The eastern part of this range, which divides the Gippsland district from that of the Murray, is named the Australian Alps; and that part which separates the County of Victoria from that of Borung, and extends into the centre of Kara Kara, is named the Pyrenees. The peaks of the Dividing Range are covered with snow for several months in the year. This mountainous country is, for the most part, wooded to the very summits with fine timber; but the peaks above the winter snow line are bare, or only partially covered with dwarf scrub.
From near Kilmore eastward, a distance of 60 miles, the mountains are generally so inaccessible as to present a considerable barrier between the parts of the colony north and south, and they can only be traversed with difficulty by the few passes that exist. From eastward the range rapidly dwindles, so that presenting in places points of con-

height—such as Mount William and Mount Macedon—it is easily crossed. From Macedon it becomes, as it stretches away to the north-eastern district, a chain of hills, in parts only tolerable altitude, and offering no serious obstacles to crossing in very many places.

The division of the Murray basin commencing at the easternmost point, and extending in a northerly direction to a width of 200 miles along the western boundary of Victoria, has a flat surface, with a very slight inclination towards the Murray. The remaining country land south of the Dividing Range and its offshoots is moderately undulating; it is in some parts covered with timber, but closely wooded in others.

In the main Dividing Range, there are also ranges extending in different parts of the range, many of them being spurs of the main range. The highest peaks, however, are found in the Dividing Range and its offshoots.

Population.

Though Victoria occupies no more than the southern part of the Australian continent, various causes such as its attractiveness compared with the other colonies of the group, it now contains 35 per cent. of the inhabitants of the whole continent. The estimated population, on the 31st December, 1895, was 1,181,751, viz., 564,164 males and 576,587 females. These numbers show a proportion of 95 females to 100 males, or 100 males to 100 females.

Means of Communication.

Melbourne, the metropolis of Victoria, is distant from Sydney by sea about 650 English miles, and by land 677 miles; from Adelaide by sea 560 miles, and by land 483 miles. It is now connected with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by railway. Steam postal communication with England, India, Ceylon, and Australia is maintained weekly by the steamers of the Orient Line, alternating with those of the Orient Company. Mails are also carried by the lines of steamers belonging to the Pacific, British India, and Messageries Maritimes (French) Companies.

The post offices in Victoria number about 1,573. The postal and telegraph revenue is not accurately known, but was estimated to have been £41,836.10s. in 1894-95, and the expenditure was £52,752.10s.

Victoria, with the other Australasian colonies, joined the Universal Postal Union from October, 1891, the rates of postage are now uniform for all countries outside Australasia.

There are 3,120 miles of railway completed in Victoria, and in full operation. The total cost of construction of lines opened up to 30th June, 1895, was £7,909,626. The revenue for 1894-95 was £2,581,501.10s., and the expenditure £1,543,393.10s.

There are 7,091 miles of telegraph lines open (including railway telegraphs), and about 14,400 miles of wire; also about 10,822 miles of telephone wire. The number of telegrams transmitted during 1895 was 2,033,630, about 67,000 being Government business were transmitted free. There are 13 telephone exchanges in the colony, with 2,609 subscribers. The amount received on account of telegraphs and telephones during the year 1894-95 was £132,162.10s.

Stage coaches run to all parts of the Colony where railway communication is not available.

Climate.

From its geographical position, Victoria enjoys a climate far more genial to Europeans than any other colony within the continent of Australia. In regard to heat, the weather is never severely oppressive except during the prevalence of hot northerly winds, and these occur only at intervals during the summer months. Over a series of years the mean temperature at Melbourne was 57°4', the mean atmospheric pressure at 91-8 feet above the sea level was 29-94 inches; rain falls on the average upon 131 days in the year, the mean annual rainfall being 254 inches.

History.

It is believed that the first Europeans who ever sighted any portion of the land now embraced within the limits of the colony of Victoria were Captain Cook and the officers and crew of His Majesty's ship Endeavour. Cook, however, did not attempt to land, but passed on to other discoveries.

On his return to England, he reported the eastern part of Australia to be suitable for colonization, and this led to a party of convicts being despatched there in 1788, under Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N. On the shores of Port Jackson, a few miles to the north of Botany Bay, Phillip established a permanent settlement, but for nearly ten years afterwards nothing was done towards the exploration of the southern shores of Australia. At length George Bass, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, started in a whale-boat, manned by six seamen, and, passing Cape Howe, coasted along that part of Victoria now called Gippsland, and rounding Wilson's Promontory—the southernmost point on the Australian Continent—entered Western Port on the 4th June, 1798. He, however, returned to Sydney without discovering Port Philip Bay, which was first entered on the 5th January, 1802, by acting-Lieut. John Murray, in command of the armed brig Lady Nelson. In October of the following year, an attempt was made to colonize the territory by Lieut.-Col. David Collins, of the Royal Marines, in command of a party of convicts. Collins, however, after the expiration of three months, abandoned Port Phillip as unfit for settlement, and for the next twenty years the district attracted but little attention. Then two explorers—Hume and Hovell—made their way overland from Sydney, and, on their return, gave a satisfactory report of the country, the result being that a convict establishment was soon afterwards founded on Western Port Bay, which, however, was in a short time abandoned, apparently on economic grounds. The first permanent settlement in Victoria was formed at Portland Bay, by Mr. Edward Henty, from Van Diemen's Land—as Tasmania was then called—who landed on 19th Nov., 1834, and soon commenced to till the soil, run and breed stock, and carry on whaling operations. Others followed, but the absence of good land in the immediate vicinity of the port, and the openness of the bay, which rendered it unsafe for shipping during the prevalence of certain winds, caused it to be...
considered an unsuitable site. The capital was eventually founded at the northern end of Port Phillip Bay by two parties, one led by John Batman, who landed on 29th May, 1835, and the other by John Pascoe Fawkner, whose party arrived at the site of Melbourne on the 28th August of the same year. Both of these were from Van Diemen's Land, and they were soon followed by others from the same island, and from Sydney, who brought stock with them, and commenced to push their way into the interior. These were met by Major (afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Sir) Thomas Mitchell, who, entering from New South Wales on the north, and traversing a considerable portion of the as yet unknown territory, was so struck with its wondrous capabilities that he named it Australia Felix, a title the aptness of which a subsequent knowledge of the geniality of its climate, the excellence of its soil, and the then unsuspected richness of its mineral treasures, has proved to be fully justified. The reports of Sir Thomas Mitchell, and the success of the first settlers, caused great excitement, not only in Australian settlements but in the mother country. Herds of sheep and cattle driven overland from New South Wales, speedily occupied the best parts of the new territory. Every available craft capable of floating was put into requisition to bring passengers and stock from Van Diemen's Land, and after a time shiploads of emigrants began to arrive from the United Kingdom. Regular government was first established under Captain William Lonsdale, who, having been sent from Sydney to take charge of the district, landed on the 29th Sept., 1836; and on the 2nd March of the following year Sir Richard Bourke, the Governor of New South Wales, visited it, and named the metropolis Melbourne. Mr. Charles Joseph La Trobe arrived on the 30th Sept., 1839, having been appointed to the principal official position in the settlement under the title of Superintendent. This title was changed to that of Lieutenant-Governor, when on the 1st July, 1851, it was separated from New South Wales, and created a separate colony under the name of Victoria. Shortly afterwards rich deposits of gold were discovered, which led to a great influx of population. After a time discontent arose amongst the diggers in consequence of the oppressive character of the mining regulations, which culminated in riots on the Ballarat goldfield towards the end of 1854. The disturbance was soon quelled, with some bloodshed on both sides, and the grievances complained of were afterwards redressed. A new constitution, giving responsible government to the colony, was proclaimed on the 23rd November, 1855.

Industry.

The main industry is agriculture, 2,864,342 acres being under cultivation in 1895-96. The chief products were wheat grown on an area of 1,412,736 acres, producing 5,667,580 bushels; oats, 255,503 acres, producing 2,879,184 bushels; barley, 78,438 acres, producing 715,656 bushels; potatoes, 43,895 acres producing 117,238 tons; and hay, 464,482 acres, producing 390,861 tons. About 30,000 acres are devoted to the culture of the vine, producing annually about 2,000,000 gallons of wine, and 18,207 cwt. of raisins. A considerable area is devoted to the cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables; tobacco, hops, and olives are also grown. On the 31st March, 1895, it is estimated that there were in the colony 431,547 horses, 1,833,900 cattle, 13,180,943 sheep, and 357,558 pigs. The wool exported in 1895 amounted to 163,779,290 lbs., valued at £1,514,153. The amount of gold raised in 1895 was 740,086 oz., making a total since 1851 of 60,198,372 oz., valued at £246,733,488. Enormous deposits of brown coal exist, and seams of true coal of good quality which have been discovered are being worked with great success, and it is anticipated that in a short time the Colony will be nearly independent of outside supplies; the quantity of black coal raised in 1895 was 194,226 tons. The chief exports other than wool and gold (which comprise more than three-fifths of the total), are grain, flour, butter and cheese, hides and skins, live stock, leather, and tallow, besides a depot trade in wool, tea, textiles, timber, tobacco, and sugar. The chief imports are wool, gold, textiles and apparel, sugar, live stock, woollens, coal, tea and iron. About half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and more than a third with the other Australasian Colonies, only one-ninth being with foreign countries. The latter consist principally of the following—Germany, United States, Belgium, France, Ceylon, India, Hong Kong, China, and Java, in the order named. Melbourne does 88 per cent of the trade, the other principal ports being Geelong, Portland, Warrnambool, also Echuca, Wodonga, Wangaratta, Toomelah, Cobram, Mildura, and Swan Hill on the Murray river.

The vessels on the Victorian register at the end of 1895 numbered 414 with a total tonnage of £9,954.

Victoria, as a manufacturing country, occupies a pre-eminent position in the Australasian group. The collectors of statistics are instructed to obtain returns only from establishments of extensive character, except when the existence of industries of an unusual or interesting nature seems to call for special comment. No attempt is made to enumerate mere shops, although such manufacturing industry may be carried on there. If this were done, the manufactories of the Colony might be multiplied to an almost indefinite extent. According to the latest returns, there are in the Colony 76 flour mills, which during the year operated upon 9,332,928 bushels of wheat; 431,344 bushels of other grain; 61 breweries, which 14,162,649 gallons of beer were brewed; 116 brick yards, some being also potteries, were made 40,108,800 bricks, and pottery valued at £42,760l.; 103 tanneries, fellmongeries, and washing establishments, which tanned 2,162,625 hides and skins, stripped 2,238,814 sheep skins, and washed over 9,600,000 lbs of wool; 7 woollen mills, which used 1,513,373 lbs of wool, and produced 1,579,379 yards of tweed, cloth, and flannel; 4,240 pairs of blankets, and 664 shawls; 32 saw and candle works, which made 150,550 cwt. of soap, and 35,351 cwt. of candles; 14 tobacco manufactories, which manufactured 951,610 lbs of tobacco, 5,467,180 cigars, 42,368,000 cigarettes, and 545 lbs. of snuff; 8 distilleries, which made 448,458 gallons of spirits; 155 butter and cheese factories which made 26,703,309 lbs. of butter, and 2,199,869 lbs. of cheese; 26 bacon and ham curing establishments which cured 6,060,699 lbs. of bacon and ham; 195 establishments working in brass and stationery; 5 in musical instruments; 3 in carving and figures; 7 in designs, medals and dies; 4 in philosophical instruments; 4 in surgical instruments; 8 in arms and ammunition; 291 in machines, tools, and implements.
in carriages and harness; 14 in ships and boats; 28 in houses, buildings, &c.; 76 in furniture; 54 in chemicals; 216 in dress; in fibrous materials; 6 in animal food; 43 in vegetable food; 177 in drinks and stimulants; 57 in animal matters; 419 in vegetable matters; 48 in oil and gas; 41 in stone, clay, earthenware, and glass; 9 in water; 20 in gold, silver, and various stones; and 35 in metals other than gold and silver. The total number of these establishments is 2,675, of which 1,676 use steam or gas engines, the total horse power of which is 30,880. They employ 41,273 hands, and the approximate capital value of lands, buildings, machinery, and stock is £12,896,800.

Irrigation.

The climate of Australia is essentially a dry one, and it is to this that its superior salubrity is, to a great extent, attributed. The drawback, however, is that the rainfall is in parts so uncertain that at times losses of stock, as well as of crops, occur in the same years. Droughts in Victoria are neither so general nor so continuous as in several of the other colonies. Still, in certain districts, serious inconveniences and loss have been experienced at times on account of deficient rainfall. To obviate this, the Government have passed several measures with the view of promoting national irrigation on a large scale. The more important works connected with the principal rivers to provide for the supply for local schemes, are undertaken by the Government under the direct control of the state. These, known as "National Works," the total expenditure on which to 31st December, 1895, amounted to £29,981. Local schemes are carried out by the "Irrigation and Water Supply Trusts," constituted by the Governor in Council, the members of which are elected by the ratepayers. Loans are advanced by the Government, and the Commissioners are empowered to levy rates on all lands liable to irrigation within the area under their jurisdiction, in order to provide the annual interest on the loan and the necessary payment to the working land; also to defray the current expenses incidental upon the operations of the trust. On 31st Dec., 1895, there were thirty of these trusts, having jurisdiction over 2,740,000 acres of land, of which about two-thirds is capable of being irrigated, but only 120,676 acres were irrigated in 1895, and with power to borrow £1,364,000, of which £48,550 has already been obtained.

Chief Towns.

Melbourne, the capital, is the most populous city of Australasia, having, with its suburbs, at the end of 1895 a population of 452,258. The first settlers established themselves on the site of the present city so recently as in 1835.

The other chief towns are Ballarat (45,326), Bendigo (42,381), Geelong (24,575), Warrnambool (19,991), Castlemaine (7,021), and Stawell (5,200).

Chinese.

By the Chinese Immigration Restriction Act, 1888, the immigration of Chinese is limited to one Chinese to every 500 tons known of any vessel arriving. There are not more than 7,600 in the colony.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks had branches, numbering about 407 in all, throughout the Colony during the last quarter of 1895:—The Bank of Australasia, of New South Wales, of New Zealand, of Victoria, Colonial of Australasia, Commercial of Australia, English Scottish and Australian, London of Australia, National of Australasia, Royal of Australia, and the Union of Australia.

The deposits at that period amounted to £31,793,827, and the value of the notes in circulation to £960,300.

There are also 396 Post Office and ordinary Savings Banks throughout the Colony. The number of accounts open at the end of the year 1895 was 336,530, and the amount on deposit was £7,265,478. The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

A branch of the Imperial Mint is established at Melbourne, where gold to the value of over £3,000,000 is coined annually.

Education.

Educational establishments in Victoria are of four classes, viz., the University, with its three affiliated Colleges, for superior education; State schools, for primary education; private schools for both primary and secondary education; and technical schools for instruction in the various arts. The Melbourne University was established under a special Act of the Victorian Legislature in 1853, and Royal Letters Patent were issued on the 14th March, 1859, declaring that all its degrees except those of divinity should be recognized in the United Kingdom and the British colonies and possessions. Affiliated to the University are three Colleges—Trinity, Ormond, and Queen's—connected with the Church of England, the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyan Churches respectively; also the Ballarat School of Mines. The number of students attending lectures at the University during 1895 was 693. From the date of the opening of the University to the end of 1895, the total number of students who matriculated was 3,911, and 1,946 direct degrees were conferred during the same period. The technical schools, which are controlled by the Education Department, embrace 11 Schools of Art, 10 Schools of Mines, 3 Working Men's Colleges, and 2 Agricultural Colleges. The principal of these is the Melbourne Working Men's College, established for the purpose of improving the general and technical education of the working classes, open to women as well as men; the average number of enrolments of individual students in 1894 was 1,240.

The system of primary public instruction which was commenced on 1st January, 1873, is strictly secular. Attendance at school is compulsory for children between the ages of 6 and 13, and state instruction is granted free of cost. In 1895 there were 1,922 State schools, with a total enrolment of 232,052 scholars, instructed by 4,483 teachers. The average attendance was 134,572. In 1894–95 the cost of primary public instruction (exclusive of buildings, rent, &c.) was £616,933. There is no local control over the schools, and the teachers are paid by a fixed salary only, payment by results having been abolished.

The private schools are entirely under the control of private persons or proprietary bodies, usually connected with some religious denomination. These now receive no State assistance, but formerly a few of the principal ones received money and grants of land from the Government. According to the returns for 1894–95, there were 867 private schools in Victoria, with 2,141 teachers,
and an attendance of 38,062 scholars. Of these schools, the Roman catholic denomination had 209, with 714 teachers and 22,706 scholars.

Australasian Federal Council.

Victoria has taken a leading part in promoting the Federation of the Australasian Colonies, and was mainly instrumental in procuring the passing of the "Federal Council Act of Australasia" (48 & 49 Vict., cap. 60). This Act created a Council of two members from each Colony, except in the case of Crown Colonies, which had only one member each, with power to Her Majesty at the request of the Legislatures of the Colonies to increase the number of representatives for each Colony by Order in Council. Such an increase was upon the request of the Legislatures made by Her Majesty on 3rd March, 1894, when an Order in Council was passed, providing that each Colony which is or shall be represented on the Federal Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members each. This Council has power to legislate with regard to the relations of the Colonies with the Islands in the Pacific, prevention of the influx of criminals, fisheries in Australasian waters beyond territorial limits, service, and enforcement respectively of civil and criminal process out of the jurisdiction of the issuing Court, the enforcement of judgments beyond the limits of the Colony where they have been passed, the extradition of offenders, and the custody of offenders on ships belonging to Colonial Governments beyond territorial limits, and generally on any matters referred to it by Order of Her Majesty in Council on the request of the Colonial Legislatures. The Legislatures of any two or more Colonies may also refer to it for legislation questions of defence, quarantine, patents, copyright, bills of exchange, recognition of marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and joint stock companies, and other matters of general Australasian interest; but legislation of the Council on such matters is to extend only to the Colonies by whose Legislatures the matters shall have been so referred, and such Colonies as may afterwards adopt the same. It has also power to decide on any questions affecting the mutual relations of any two Colonies referred to it by consent. The Council is to meet at least once in every two years.

The first meeting took place on 25th January, 1886, when representatives were present from Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, Fiji, and Western Australia. Measures were passed extending the operation of warrants and judgments of the Courts of the different Colonies throughout the territories of all those represented, and various important questions were discussed, including the defence of King George's Sound and Torres Straits. The second session opened on 16th January, 1888. An address was adopted to Her Majesty respecting the deportation of French criminals to the Pacific. An Act was also passed to regulate the Pearl Shell and Bêche-de-mer Fisheries in Australasian waters adjacent to Queensland. The Council met for its third session on 29th January, 1889, when representatives from South Australia were present for the first time. The amendment of the basis of representation in the Council was discussed at the session, and communications on the subject have since passed with the Imperial Government. The fourth session opened 20th January, and closed 24th January, 1891. Since Australia was not represented, the Act (temporary measure for two years only) under which that province joined the Federation having expired. The only Bill passed was one to bring the recognition in other colonies of Orders and Declarations of the Supreme Court of any province in matters of Lunacy. An address to Her Majesty was also adopted referring to the desirability of British subjects being placed on an equal footing with subjects of other countries in regard to acquisition of land in, and trading with, parts of the New Hebrides.

The fifth session was commenced on 25th January, 1893, when the colonies of Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia were represented. An Act was passed providing for the discipline and government of the garrisons established at King George's Sound and Torres Straits; and a resolution was adopted in favour of an increase in the number of representatives for each Colony, except any Crown Colony. The Standing Committee was instructed to take steps for giving effect to this resolution, and for securing the adhesion of the Colonies represented in the Council. As the result of action taken by the Standing Committee, Legislatures of all the Colonies in the Federation addressed Her Majesty, requesting that the proposed increase in the number of representatives might be made; and, on 3rd March, 1894, Her Majesty was pleased to make an Order in Council providing "that each Colony which is or shall be represented in the said Council, except any Crown Colony, shall be represented by five members each."

The sixth session opened on the 30th January, 1895, when the same four colonies were represented as at the preceding session. There were present, for the first time, five delegates for each colony. At this session no Bills were brought forward, but resolutions were adopted affirming the desirability of defining the status and of granting facilities for the winding up of Companies carrying on business in different colonies; of rendering uniform the laws relating to banking; of establishing an effectual system of quarantine; of adopting a more economical mode of raising public loans; and of taking steps with a view to the holding of a second Federal Convention. An address to the Queen was adopted praying for the appointment of an Australasian representative on the Privy Council Bench, in view of the special features often presented by Australasian appeals. All the sessions were held at Hobart.

Australasian Federation.

Notwithstanding the existence of the Federal Council, however, a movement has been made for the establishment of a more perfect Federation to embrace a Federal Executive, as well as Legislature, somewhat upon the model of Canada. Towards the end of 1889 negotiations were opened between the various Australasian Colonies, the result being that a Conference of the seven primitive Australasian Colonies was held in Melbourne on the 6th February, 1890. At this Conference it was unanimously agreed that the best interests of the Australian Colonies would be promoted by their "early union under the Crown," and that the Legislatures of the various Colonies should be invited to appoint a National Australasian...
vention during the year 1891 delegates
were appointed to report upon scheme for a Federal
stitution.

According to these resolutions, delegates
appointed, and the Convention commenced its
sessions in Sydney on the 2nd March, 1891.
An animated debate, which lasted more than a
night, a "Bill to Constitute a Commonwealth
Australia" was drawn up and adopted. This
the Convention recommended should be sub-
mitted for the approval of the people and Par-
liaments of the several colonies. It provided for
union of the Australasian Colonies in a Federal
Commonwealth under the Crown, for a Governor-
General to be appointed by the Crown, who should
be advised by an Executive Council, the
constitution of a Senate and House of Representa-
tives, with certain definite powers, the latter to
initiate money bills, which the former
pass or reject, but not amend, and for the
establishment of a Federal Judiciary; the revenue
of the Commonwealth to be derived from the Cus-
toms and Excise duties, which should be collected
by Federal officers, and expended as required for
Federal purposes, any surplus to be returned to
the respective colonies. It also provided for abso-
lute free trade internally throughout the Common-
wealth, so soon as the Parliament should have
uniform Customs duties.

At its last meeting the Federal Council passed
resolution in favour of the holding of a Second
Convention on the lines of the Bill
passed by the First Convention; and a meeting
of Premiers of all the Australasian Colonies
was held in Hobart in January, 1895, and agreed
to a scheme for a complete Federation to be
submitted for the approval of their respective
Parliaments.

An enabling Bill, adopted at this Conference
meeting for the election of 10 delegates by each
Province to prepare a scheme of Federation, was
passed by the Parliaments of N.S.W., Wales,
Victoria, S. Australia, and Tasmania, and in a
similar form by Western Australia. The dele-
gates were duly elected in Feb., 1897, and assembled
for the purpose of drafting a constitution on 22nd
March.

Government.

The Government of Victoria consists of a Go-
vernor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in
the conduct of public affairs by a responsible
Cabinet. There is a Legislative Council, or Upper
House, consisting of 48 members repre-
senting fourteen Provinces, and an Assembly,
or Lower House, consisting of 95 members rep-
resenting 84 Electoral Districts. The Constitution
was established by an Act passed by the Legislature
in Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented,
in pursuance of the power granted by Act of the
General Parliament (18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55).

One of the Members of Council returns for
each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at
the expiration of every two years, so that the
term of seats is six years; and there is a further
special election once every six years for an extra
member for six of the provinces. The Governor has
power to dissolve the Council. The property
qualification of Members is possession of freehold
property of an annual value of 100l. The property
qualification of Electors of Members of Council is
possession of freehold property rated in some munici-
pality at not less than 10l. per annum, or
occupation of freehold or leasehold property of not
less than a 25l. annual rating. Graduates of Uni-
versities within the British dominions, barristers
and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners,
officiating ministers of religion, certificated school-
masters, and officers of the army and navy when
not on active service, also have votes for the Legis-
lative Council. The functions of this House differ
very slightly from those of the House of Lords.
Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected,
but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857 to abolish the
property qualification required of Members of the
Legislative Assembly, and manhood suffrage
exists so far as the election of that body is con-
cerned. The duration of the Assembly is under
ordinary circumstances three years, but it may be
dissolved by the Governor at any time. Vote by
ballot has been in operation since 1856.

All Members of the Legislative Assembly, ex-
cept such as are in receipt of official salary out of
the Consolidated Revenue, are paid 240l. a year
during the term of the present Parliament "for
reimbursing their expenses in relation to their
attendance in Parliament." The Members of the
Legislative Council are not paid.

Municipal Government.

A very complete system of local self-government
exists in Victoria. The municipalities are of
two kinds, the first being called cities, towns, and
boroughs, and the second shires. The whole extend
over 87,165 square miles, comprising nearly the
whole area of the Colony. Each district is a body
corporate, with perpetual succession and a common
seat. The governing body is a Council, the Mem-
bers of which are elected by the ratepayers, includ-
ing women. Rates may be levied on all land within
a municipality except that used for public purposes,
for such amount between 6d. and 2s. 6d. in the pound
(the common rate is 1s.), as may be decided upon by
the Municipal Council. In 1895 there were 58 cities,
towns, and boroughs, and 149 shires. The number
of ratepayers was about 300,000; the annual value
of the rateable property was assessed at 10,641,200l.;
representing a value in fee simple of 167,197,780l.;
the total income in 1894 (including 317,024l.
received from Government) was 1,436,528l., and
the expenditure was 1,379,767l.; whilst their
indebtedness (exclusive of amounts borrowed
from the General Government) amounted to
3,549,936l.

The harbour of Melbourne is under the control
of the Melbourne Harbour Trust, created by Act
in 1876. The revenue of the Trust in 1895 was
117,741l., and its expenditure 143,278l. The
debt of the Trust at the end of 1895 amounted to
2,000,000l.

The Melbourne Water Supply Works are now
under the control of the Melbourne and Metro-
politan Board of Works, which body is also
empowered to undertake the sewerage of the
metropolis. In 1894-95 the Board's ordinary
revenue was 166,346l., and its expenditure
195,509l., exclusive of 515,271l. from loans; whilst
there were loans outstanding at 30th June, 1895,
amounting to 4,943,222l., of which, however,
2,359,157l. was raised in the first instance by the
General Government, and is included in the Public
Debt. The expenditure on the sewerage works in
course of construction amounted to 1,042,697l. up
to the 30th June, 1895.
There are also two Fire Brigade Boards, supported by equal contributions by the Government, the Municipalities, and the Insurance Companies. In 1894 their revenue amounted to £37,002/., their ordinary expenditure to £41,772/., their loan expenditure to £2,887/., and their debt to £100,000/.

The Melbourne Tramways Trust is a Municipal Corporation, created for the purpose of constructing tramways in Melbourne and suburbs, which it has done at a cost of £1,705,794/., provided for by loans secured on the rateable property of the Municipalities. This debt will be gradually extinguished by a sinking fund, contributed by the Melbourne Tramways Company, a Public Company, to whom the lines have been let for a period of 30 years. On the 1st March, 1895, the sinking fund amounted to £301,920/.

Defences.

The land forces, chiefly militia, at the end of 1895, comprised an establishment of 4,924 men of all arms, of whom 334 were permanent and 2,940 formed the militia, the remainder being volunteers.

The fleet, which has an establishment of 332 men, comprises the armoured turret-ship "Cerberus," the frigate "Nelson," the torpedo boats "Childers," "Countess of Hopetoun," "Nepean," "Lonsdale," and "Gordon;" the steam launches "Commissioner" and "Customs No. 1;" the Harbor Trust dredges "Batman," "Fawkner," "Gannet," and the steam patrol boats "Liou" and "Spray," and the steel Customs steamer, "Lady Loch."
