NIGER COAST PROTECTORATE.

British Protectorate of the Niger Coast was assumed in July, 1884. It extends the coast of Africa from the Benin River (it joins the boundary of Lagos) to the mouth of the Rio del Rey at 9° east longitude, part between the Forcados River and the mouth of the Niger is claimed by the Royal Company, the remainder forming the "Oil Rivers Coast Protectorate." The Niger itself is served exclusively by the river steamers of the Company. The numerous rivers, creeks, swamps in this part of the West African coast received the name of the "Oil Rivers:" the fact of their producing the bulk of the oil which constitutes the chief export of Africa. They are alleged to be branches of the Niger, and form the delta of that river, but none of them have independent sources. The rivers of these rivers are connected by a network of more or less navigable creeks, so that a small expenditure of labour inland navigation might be made practicable from Dahomey to Benin.

The principal of these rivers are: the Benin, an independent river rising in the low hills flowing in a deep but tortuous course through a country of dense forest, but shallow and dangerous bar; the Forcados, the main outlet of the Wari; the Brass, connected by creeks with the Niger; the Oguta Lake, which lies a short distance off the Niger, to the north of Abo, where the river begins in the rainy season, flows the Opobo on the east, and the New Calabar River on the west, which enter the sea by the broad river known as the Sombrerio, the New Calabar, Bonny, the Andoni, and the Opobo Rivers, and form a fertile undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive. Further east is the Old Calabar Estuary, mainly marked by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length, which drains with its affluents the Old Calabar, Aqua, Akpayafe, and the Ndiana Rivers; the high mountain ranges running northwest from the Cameroon Mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benin.

Communications.

Communication with Europe is maintained by the African and the British and African Steamship Companies, running regularly between Liverpool, Hamburg, Havre, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Sierra Leone, and all the ports in West Africa from Goree to Loanda. They have also a direct line from Liverpool to Old Calabar, calling at Grand Canary, Sierra Leone, Accra, Lagos, and Bonny. The German Woerman line call occasionally on their way to and from the Cameroons, and the steamers of the Compagnie "Chargeurs Reunis" call occasionally at Bonny and Old Calabar. On the Bonny, Brass, Opobo, and Old Calabar Rivers, some of the merchants possess small steamers and launches, which navigate these rivers to some distance inland. The Manchester Steam Navigation Company's boats also call at some of the ports.

The African Direct Cable Company has stations at Brass and Bonny. Akassa is served from Brass, being only 11 miles through the creeks.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, on the Old Calabar River, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of Her Majesty's Consular establishment, and the largest and most important town in the Protectorate, containing a population of about 15,000. Two Protestant missions are established there, and have erected schools and churches. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river is Bende, a great trading centre for slaves and ivory. In the same district is the great fetish town of Aron which is resorted to from all parts of the Niger delta and the Cross River.

Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church presented by one of the native chiefs. On the Wari branch of the Protectorate there are several populous towns, but the turbulent character of the natives prevents Europeans from resorting to them.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the same name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants, the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and used to be famous for its human sacrifices. The trading station and Consular establishment in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea breeze, though sand-flies and mosquitos abound.

At the end of last year a peaceful mission on its way to the King of Benin was massacred in the bush, and a force of Houssas and Blue Jackets had to be sent to punish the Benins. It was completely successful, the king's forces being defeated, and the king himself driven to take refuge in the bush.

Military posts have been established at Urivet up
Calabar River, Itu up Cross River—one establishing at Nqwara and Ediba; Aquettah up Opobo River, Sapele up the Benin River; and from these points advances are being made into the interior.

Climate.

This resembles that of other parts of West Africa, in being deadly for Europeans. The temperature ranges between 65° and 95°, and the rainfall is perhaps the heaviest in the world, there being on the coast no very marked distinction between the dry and rainy seasons. Tornadoes and violent thunderstorms prevail in the spring and late autumn, but do relatively little damage.

Products.

Besides the oil palm (Elaeis Guineensis), cotton grows above the delta, and the silk cotton tree is found all over the delta, as well as the tree producing the kola nut. The ground nut is widely cultivated in the interior, but not on the coast. Copal gum and other gums are largely produced, and "shea butter," an almost solid vegetable fat produced from the kernels of the seeds of the Butyrospermum Parkii. The castor oil plant is found all over the delta, and the cocoa palm and coffee have been successfully introduced there. Rubber trees abound everywhere, and ebony very largely in the Cross River districts. Elephants abound in numbers in the Akpavafe and Ndiana Rivers, and hippopotami in the Cross River. Considerable coffee plantations are now bearing.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Dzekri, occupying the lower part of the Benin, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Idzor, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Wari and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, joining the Ukima-Kimas, are an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle, who create most of the trade of the delta; and the Efiks and "Quas" in the Old Calabar region. The tribes are all more or less cannibalistic, cannibalism being deeply associated with the ceremonial of the old fetish rites, as the Ju-Ju-Men or fetish priests are bound at certain times and under certain conditions to eat human flesh. The missionaries have laboured with considerable success to suppress the practice in the towns where they are stationed. Mission stations are situated at Duke Town, Creek Town, Okoyon, on the Old Calabar River, at Ikonotu Creek, Ikwofitty, Ikwana, and Unwana on the Cross River, and also at Ibeno, in the Qua Ibo River.

Trade.

Trade is generally conducted by barter, the native traders purchasing the oil or other produce for European goods, and disposing of it in large quantities to the white trader. The total volume of trade is shown below, the greater part of which is with Great Britain, the remainder with Havre and Hamburg, but carried principally in British ships. Brass rods only in Old Calabar, and Manilla only in Bonny and Opobo form in some districts the coinage, the price of cloth being the general standard. Cash is being gradually introduced.

Administration.

The native inhabitants are dealt with principally under their own chiefs, there being a native council, presided over by them, subject to appeal to the consular courts. Europeans are subject to the jurisdiction of the consular courts under the African Order in Council, with an appeal to the supreme courts of Lagos.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, &c.

The mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully investigated. Gold has been found in two of the rivers on the east coast; coal, copper, and other minerals have also been met with, but so far have not been worked.

The country is mountainous, although the shore is flat and fringed with mangrove. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,698 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 200,000, are mainly Malays, Bajows, Dusuns, Sulus and Dyaks, who remove their villages periodically, and live by hunting and plunder, with occasional attempts at planting and trade. There are Malay and Chinese settlements on the coast, which cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. Sandakan, the chief town, has a population of 7,000. There are two missions, one the Church of England and one Roman Catholic; the former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, and the Church of England Community has a church and school at Sandakan, with a branch at Kudat. The club, hotels, banks and insurance agencies, European and Chinese stores, public markets, hospital, Government house, offices, gaol, barracks, saw mills, tennis grounds and the numerous neat suburban bungalows around bespeak civilization and progress.

On the west coast Kudat has also its hotel or rest house, with agencies, stores, shops and bungalows, which supply all the wants of the mixed community.

History.

The state and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762 at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and on its failure, the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulukceded the same district to Mr. (now Sir) Alfred Dent, who transferred it to the British North Borneo Company, and some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the Territory by agreement with "the State of North Borneo," dated the
12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 93°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is about 120 inches, chiefly from November to February.

Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. The chief products are tobacco, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, and pineapple fibre. There is still a large trade in the collection of jungle produce; but during the past year much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco. The soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited for its growth; about 1,000,000 acres have been leased on 999 years leases, or applied for, chiefly for this purpose, and 17 estates are in full operation. The rapid development of this industry is shown by the following figures as to exports of tobacco since 1886:—1886, 72,688 lbs.; 1887, 30,800 lbs.; 1888, 81,664 lbs.; 1889, 168,112 lbs.; 1890, 108,275 lbs.; 1891, 1,635,744 lbs.; 1892, 1,794,720 lbs.; 1893, 1,378,122 lbs.; 1894, 1,411,575 lbs.; 1895, 1,370,370 lbs.

The exports comprise also, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, pineapple fibre, gutta percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), gold, cutch, &c., sent almost entirely to Singapore, China, and Australia; from Singapore part of those find their way to Europe.

A timber trade has been opened with both Australia and China.

The Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites. Besides the tobacco estates already mentioned four general plantations have been opened by Europeans, especially the Dutch, and the demand for land has been so great as to cause the price to be raised during 1889 from $3 to $6 per acre. Pepper and sago are exported from the West Coast. At the end of 1889 four timber companies were engaged in the timber trade, and two saw mill companies are at work carrying on a large export trade with England, China, Manilla, and other ports.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $180,000. American, Mexican, Straits Settlements, Hong Kong, and British dollars are treated as currency. There are agencies of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, and the National Bank of China, and the Company itself does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a court of directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor, Treasurer-General, and Residents appointed by them. There are 6 provinces (Alcock, Cumilffe, Deut, Dewhurst, Epsom, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, and Myburgh).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British colonies and an Enaum's court, for the administration of Mahomedan law. There is a force of about 1,000 armed police under European officers. An European medical officer is attached to each resident.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Holt run steamers constantly between Singapore and the local ports, and between Hong Kong and the ports. There is frequent communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and occasional visits are made by steamers running between Hong Kong and Australia. There are no railways, and but few roads. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the postal union. Course of post from London about thirty days. Postage from Sandakan to all places outside territory, for letters 10 cents per ½ oz.

The postal business has considerably increased during the last few years. Statistics for 1889 are as follows:

| Year | Received Letters | Papers | Dispatched Letters | Papers |

On the completion of the Singapore—Labuan—Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mompokuk, which has since been joined with Mompekuk by telegraph. A telegraph line from that point to Sandakan is now in course of construction.
