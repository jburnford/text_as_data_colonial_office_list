JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.
Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 43' and 18° 32', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 20'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,207 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,400 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the S.W., and the Rio Grande in the N.E. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 48,504, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine...
harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 30' and 80° 35' W. long., are dependencies of Jamaica. The largest of the islands, Grand Cayman, contains about 2,000 inhabitants, who as well as the inhabitants of the other two, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are mainly engaged in catching turtle for export. Pedro and Morant Cays are also dependencies, being two guano islands in 17° N. lat., as well as the Turks and Chicos Islands.

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,720,000 acres, from which may be deducted 365,828 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,317,962 acres available for cultivation. Of this 691,967 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1895. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Haymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquimel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, while Governor of Hispaniola. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trilling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II, who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. This town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. The capital was then transferred for a time to Kingston, on the opposite side of the harbour. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of Spanish slaves who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°, rising to 87° in the day time, and falling to 70° at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a climb of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained in a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches at sea level to as much as 197 inches at Mountain Peak.

Only two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, the fifths being pure negroes. There are about 15,000 imported coolies, and about 200 Chinese. English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly elected members. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the assembly refusing to vote supplies and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reforms in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's government, in 1839, actually introduced a bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but it was defeated, and it was not till 1834 that by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing Constitution to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some such change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature willingly acquiesced, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to constitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1866, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1871, when they were enlarged to eight, and a further addition was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the Constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (who has only a casting vote) and five ex officio members viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons not exceeding ten in number as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the same powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other
Local Administration.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 13 other parishes, under Law 16 of 1853, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, police stations, poor relief, water works, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population 1891), Port Royal (population 1200), Spanish Town (population 5689), Montego Bay (population 411), Falmouth (population 3029), and Port Maria (population 6741).

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, workhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The several direct taxes received on land, houses, estates, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected.

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1895-6 was £129,602; their expenditure £133,475, and their net at the end of the year £12,929. These figures form part of the general revenue and expenditure, given on p. 136.

There is a High Court of Justice, and Petty Sessions of magistrates throughout the island. The resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the Courts of Petty Sessions.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1850. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the salary paid by Government they have to send sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, &c., &c.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an excise duty; the excise on rum (£138,749L in 1895-96), and stamps and licences. There is no direct taxation except that of the local boards, and the total of the direct taxes on land is less than £100.

Defence.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are 19 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 743 sub-officers and men, and 1512 rural police distributed throughout the island. The force is about to be strengthened by the addition of sub-officers selected from the Royal Irish Constabulary.

There is an Imperial garrison of 1638 men, stationed near Kingston, and a naval station at Port Royal. There is a volunteer militia force with an establishment of 600 officers and men.

Currency and Banking.

British currency, United States gold, and gold doubloons are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000L. The Colonial Bank and the bank of Nova Scotia are the only private banking establishments in the Colony; the colonial bank has 1 branch and 4 agencies; it has a note circulation estimated at 150,000L. British silver coins above 6d. are legal tender to any extent; under 6d. to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent. The total deposits on 31st March, 1896, were 464,884L.

Education.

Elementary education is left to private enterprise, aided, since 1867, by a system of grants in aid from the Colonial revenue. The number of schools is 932, with 100,352 scholars, and the grant in aid for 1895-96 was 45,900L.; no fees are charged except in one or two special cases. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for female teachers which is wholly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational and three denominational colleges for male teachers. More than 150 students are now under training. By laws passed in 1892 a Board of Education has been constituted, and provision made for the opening of Government secondary schools where required. No provision is made from public funds for technical education, but there are some endowed schools and scholarships tenable at the English universities.

Industry.

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1895-96 being 97,025,398L. The value of the total exports in 1895-96 exceeded 531,000L.

The other chief crops are sugar (export 330,918 cwt., value 195,459L); coffee (export 84,391 cwt., value 284,821L); ginger (export 17,505 cwt., value 50,327L); and pimento (export 97,346 cwt., value 90,045L); and the exports comprise, in addition to those products, rum (export 1,881,146 gallons, value 164,600L); dyewood (export 85,574 tons, value 362,322L); cocoa (export 10,310 cwt.; value 17,528L.), &c. The area under sugar cane in 1895 was 30,971 acres, and under coffee 23,643. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations. The coffee and cinchona plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain range, the richest sugar growing area being in the valley of the Plantain Garden River, in the parish of Portland, which also includes the town of Bath, with a famous mineral spring, and the great fruit growing district with Port Antonio for its outlet. Sugar is also largely grown in the district of Vere in Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawny, where the best rum in the world is said to be produced. The cattle raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, alcohol, and building materials. Of the whole trade, 48.1 per cent. is with the United Kingdom, and 41.8 per cent. with the United
States, the next most important country being Canada.

Means of Communication.

There is a regular postal service throughout the island, daily between some places, and elsewhere three times per week, by means of mail coaches.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| Within the Colony, per ½ oz. | 1 ½d. each. |
| Ditto, elsewhere | 2½d. per 2ozs. |
| To Postal Union and other countries, per ½ oz. | 2½d. per 2ozs. |

Parcels post with England, 9d. per lb.; with United States and British W.I. Colonies, 6d. per lb., and Canada 10d. per lb.

The estimated number of letters sent to the United Kingdom is 228,193, and the number sent to other places 130,483.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail contract steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Wednesday throughout the year. The average passage is 16 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 66 stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 685¼. The total cost of the telegraphs has been about 20,107l. The receipts in 1895-96 were 6,156l. 9s. 6d., and the expenses (not including interest and the cost of maintaining the lines) 7,618l. 16s. 8d.

The Railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the Parish of Saint James, a distance of 113 miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17 miles; and to Port Antonio by a branch line from Bogwalk, on the Ewarton branch, of 54 miles. The total length of line open is 185 miles. The railway was recently purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, have extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west. There is also a line of telegraph along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 113 miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17 miles; and from Bogwalk to Port Antonio 54 miles.

The island is intersected by a system of main roads, the condition of which will bear favourable comparison with those in many European countries. There are 1,879½ miles of main roads, and about 3,600 miles of parochial roads.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, Sar-ta-mar, and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1896, 3 ships, with aggregate tonnage of 98 tons, were registered at Kingston, 71 with a tonnage of 3 tons at Montego Bay.
