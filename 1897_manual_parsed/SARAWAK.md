SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 41,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 300,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan river was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan river to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram river, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1885 another cession was obtained of the Trusun river situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei river. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, and the transfer was approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in August, 1891. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born June, 1829; married 1869, Margaret Alice Lily de Windt), is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868.

Heir, Charles Vyner Brooke (Rajah Muda), born 26th September, 1874.

Products.

At Paku in Upper Sarawak a considerable number of Chinese are engaged in working gold, and also in the Batang Lupar Residency. The Borneo Company possesses a monopoly of the mineral rights, other than gold and coal, over most of Sarawak, and at Busoh the Company have extensive antimony works. Coal is mined on a considerable scale at Sadong and Brookeston, the output in 1895 being 28,213 tons, including the quantity used by the local steamers. There is a considerable export of timber from the Rejang River, mostly to Hong Kong, valued in 1895 at £38,562. There are successful plantations of tea and coffee on Matang, and pepper grows well throughout the Territory. All these articles figure in the list of exports, which also includes diamonds, quicksilver, gutta-percha, indiarubber, canes, rattans, camphor, bees' wax, birds' nests, sago, tapioca, gambier, and silver. The value of the principal exports in 1895 was:

- Gutta-percha and indiarubber, $289,613;
- Rattans, $163,163; gambier, $210,433; pepper, $240,248; and sago flour, $687,262. In 1884 the quantity of sago flour exported was 97,335 pikuls = 5,734 tons, and in 1893, 272,131 pikuls, or over 16,800 tons. The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. & W. 32° E. long. 110° 28'). Besides excellent Government offices and Court house, possesses an excellent hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school of 100 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The River has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Mukai River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the mouth, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching or Singapore to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, and Kapit, Paraman, Simanggang, Sadong Trusan, Limbang.

SOUTH AFRICA.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa, was created by Letters Patent in 1878, and is filled by the Officer administering the Government of the Cape Colony. The High Commissioner is charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal), and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native states and tribes outside the Cape Colony and Natal and with the S. A. R. Government of Swaziland under the Convention of 1894. In 1879, a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who is also Governor of Natal (and now of Zululand), and Special Commissioner for Amatongaland except as regards matters affecting the adjacent Portuguese possessions and the S. A. Republic. The High Commissioner for South Africa is also Governor of Basutoland, and supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which extends as far north as the Zambesi. The estimated area of the Protectorate to the 22nd parallel is 121,500 sq. miles, and from there to the Zambesi 265,700 sq. miles. The sphere of influence north of the Zambesi includes all territory not acknowledged as belonging to Germany, Portugal, or the Congo, and covers an estimated area of 361,700 sq. miles. The expenses of the High Commission are borne partly by Imperial funds, under Vote 6 of Class V, and partly by the Cape Government; the correspondence with the South African Republic is carried on through a British Agent at Pretoria furnished with a letter of credence to the President. The "Africa Order in Council, 1889" (15th October, 1889), placed upon a systematic footing the jurisdiction exercised by British Consular Officers in parts of Africa outside British territory. The Order enables Consular Courts to be established, with jurisdiction in various parts of Africa (including Madagascar) not subject to any organised administration, over British subjects, and over foreigners in certain circumstances, especially in criminal, admiralty, and maritime cases. The following have been constituted "local jurisdictions" for the purpose of the Order:

- The Oil Rivers Protectorate (with appeal to Supreme Court of Lagos);
- The territory of the Imperial British East Africa Company (with appeal to Supreme Court of Natal);
- The Nyassa districts (with appeal to Supreme Court of the Cape Colony);
- As well as the Congo Free State and Madagascar (with appeal to Supreme Courts of the Gold Coast Colony and the Mauritius respectively).
