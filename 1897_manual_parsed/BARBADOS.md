BARBADOS.

Situation and Area.

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, a little larger than Rutland.
History.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is uncertain. It is said to have been first visited by Portuguese, who finding it uninhabited and its appearance, named the isle Las Barbadas, after the number of bearded fig-trees which they found there. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship "Olive" in 1605, when it was almost deserted. In 1623 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Northumberland, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the north side of the island formed a town called St. Peter's Town, and appointed Captain Thomas Deane their governor. In 1627 the Earl of Northumberland obtained a grant from Charles I of all the three islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of £50. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Northumberland, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour, and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he negotiated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Northumberland as governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers, residing in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The sword and windward men opposed each other the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which ensued in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many exiles attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was granted by Lord Carlisle (son of the first Earl of Carlisle); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth, he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two were brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved, and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent., but without success; and it was not till 1834, or years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

General Description.

Pilgrims, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 13° 5' 42" North, and longitude 3° 58' 29" West. This town contains, according to the census of 1891, 21,000 inhabitants. Speightstown, the only other town, has about 1,500 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1895, 50 vessels, of a total net tonnage of 8,681 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

A geological map, with explanatory memoir of the island, was published in 1891 by Messrs. J. B. Harrison and A. J. Jukes Brown, which shows that that area of the island called the Scotland district, which is the part enclosed by a semicircular sweep of the ridge in the north-east, is composed of sandstones, clays, and infusorial earths, the products of which may be in future a valuable source of revenue to the island; already excellent fire-bricks are made near the end of the railway.

In Schomburgk's history of Barbados there is a short reference to the deposit of asphaltum found in the island, and Messrs. A. J. Jukes-Browne and J. B. Harrison casually mention it as occurring occasionally in small quantities, which planters have attempted to burn under their sugar boilers, but not with sufficient success to lead to its general use. In 1895 an American named Julius Finney suggested to Mr. Walter Merivale, M.I.C.E., managing director of the Barbados Railway, the possibility of mining it for commercial purposes. A mine was opened by Mr. Merivale on the College Estate in January, 1896, from which about 1,000 tons of the purest asphaltum were extracted in the months March to August, 1896. The market is gradually opening to this new product, and prices are obtained varying from 2l. to 20s. a ton. There appears to be a demand for it in the following trades: varnish making, gas making, electric cable insulating, asphalt paving, &c. Several companies have been formed for the purpose of mining it in Barbados, and many private individuals are engaging in the same pursuit. It seems probable that the deposits extend under the coral in all parts of the island.

Much of the geological information concerning the coral area was obtained from borings, &c., made by the Barbados Water Supply Company, whose operations were undertaken with a view to supply the rural population of the different parishes with water up to a height of 750 feet above sea-level. The town of Bridgetown has been supplied for many years with an adequate supply of good water by the Bridgetown Water Works Company. Both companies have been bought up by the Government, and the works are being extended to all the parishes of the Island.

Industry.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were in lago, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. It is stated that, in 1863, there were 358 sugar-works in operation. At the present time they number 466. The produce of 1871 amounted to 53,800 hogsheads of sugar and 33,500 puncheons of molasses; in 1881, 52,236 hogsheads of sugar, and 33,521 puncheons of molasses. In 1891 the produce amounted to
50,517 hogsheads of sugar and 32,318 puncheons of molasses, as compared with 85,261 hogsheads of sugar, and 51,904 puncheons of molasses in 1890. In 1892, 56,619 hogsheads of sugar, and 43,356 puncheons of molasses. In 1893, 67,157 hogsheads of sugar and 43,374 puncheons of molasses were exported. The exports of produce to the 31st August, 1896, amounted to 47,049 hogsheads of sugar, and 34,474 puncheons of molasses. The area under sugar cultivation is estimated at 100,000 acres.

Population.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 showed a total of 152,727 inhabitants. By the census of 1871 there were 162,042 inhabitants, of whom 16,560 were white, and the remainder coloured and black; the natural increase having been checked by the migration to other West Indian Islands of large numbers of the labouring population. In 1881 the total was 188,000; by the census of 1891 the population is returned at 182,306, and is now estimated at 186,000. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in sterling, and British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is but little gold in circulation. The only bank doing business in Barbados is the Colonial Bank, capital paid up 600,000L sterling. Total number of branches throughout West Indies 13, with deposits of about 2,000,000L, and a note circulation (five dollar notes) of 400,000L. In Barbados, estimated circulation 50,000L. There is a Government savings bank which had on 30th September, 1895, 11,289 depositors, and deposits amounting to 180,584L.

Internal Communication.

A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of Saint Andrew (24 miles as surveyed) was commenced in 1880, and completed on 10th September, 1882. The total cost of construction was 195,284L; the receipts for the year ended 30th September, 1895, were 6,596L, exclusive of Government subsidy of 6,000L, and the expenses 8,624L. It belongs to the Barbados Railway Company, Limited.

There is telephonic communication between the police stations by 35 miles of line, which cost 1,465L, and is open to public use.

Mail Service, Postage, &c.

The Royal Mail steamers arrive in and leave Barbados every alternate week from and to England. There is also fortnightly communication with all the West Indies by these steamers. The usual length of the voyage from England to Barbados is 11 days.

Besides the Royal Mail, a steamer of the West Indian and Pacific, or the Harrison Line, arrives every week from Liverpool.

The direct line from London arrives monthly. The Quebec line of steamers arrive fortnightly from the United States there are also other lines of steamers, viz., the Red Cross Line and Booth Line, which call at Barbados on their voyage from New York to the Brazils and vice versa, at intervals of about 20 days.

The Canadian line of steamers from Halifax arrive monthly. There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados, and direct cable communication with St. Vincent, and thence to the other West Indies, America, and Europe.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Law No. 41 of the 9th December, 1878, which authorises an expenditure not exceeding 15,400L annually.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control conducted by the clergyman of the district assisted by the School Committee. There are 189 schools, with 14,442 scholars (average attendance), and 27,315 on the rolls.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.C., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30L per annum from the College funds, and four Island Scholarships of 40L per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives. There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by the legislature. It has a staff of 7 university men as Masters, a Professor of Chemistry and Agricultural Science, and a Professor of German. The average number of pupils is about 150. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish,
The total Customs revenue in 1825 was £82,529.
