TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, which time it was occupied by Caribs. The first settlement was made on the island in 1581, when sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by adventurers from Barbados to form a colony, but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Pointe-a-Pitre. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by the
The Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who settled at New Walcheren. After a residence of two years these settlers were all destroyed or killed by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641, James, Duke of Courland, obtained possession of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern side; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole Island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Sir Lamplugh procured letters patent from the King, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch were obliged to recognize the Duke's title, but in 1677 they were compelled to evacuate the island by Admiral Esterhazy, who defeated the Dutch naval Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon the Duke restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being permitted to form settlements or carry on commerce, but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace of 1683, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillon, after a most gallant resistance by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803, by Commodore Hood and General Greenfield; and finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown by Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889.

Situation and Area.

Tobago is the most southerly of the Windward group of British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9' N., long. 60° 12' W.; distant from Barbados about 75 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 100 miles from Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco, a port of entry, is 18½ miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles in its greatest width, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,335 acres, of which about 10,000 acres is under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unoccupied, and have now been re-vested in the Crown. The formation of the island is volcanic; its general aspect is irregular and picturesque, with many hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 10 miles in length.

General Description.

Sugar, rum, molasses, cocoanuts, and live stock are the principal articles of export. The crop of sugar in 1890 was 22,582 cwts.; the average of the previous five years being 40,398 cwts. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population in 1891 of 919. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacot Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who maintain 24 schools with about 2,300 scholars, assisted by a Government grant of £600.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago has been amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island is administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united Colony, who is ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner is assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected.

The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remain distinct, but there is entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad are, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

### Turks and Caicos Islands

#### Situation and Area

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. The area is 169 square miles, about the size of Essex. The most important island, Grand Turk, is nine miles long and 2 miles broad. It contains 1,500 inhabitants, being three-eighths the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

#### History

Grand Turk claims, like so many other islands, to have been the scene of the first discovery by Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by saltrakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1715, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purpose of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they became independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

#### Industries

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered being about 2,000,000 bushels. The export of salt in 1895 was valued at 19,432l., the quantity being 1,290,000 bushels. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There is one sponge curing establishment on the Caicos Islands. The cultivation of the sisal fibre (or Pita plant) has been introduced, and there is a fair prospect of success. Cave earth is also an article of export.
an agricultural settlement was started under government auspices at Kew, North Caicos in 1882, to grow fruit for export, but proved a failure, owing to the absence of any remunerative market for the produce. The soil elsewhere is totally unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost entirely with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English, and Turk is a port of registry, and had on the 31st December, 1895, 41 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 5,365 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good harbourage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely excessively hot, owing to the strong and refreshing sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh air and good water, owing to the low lying nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall during the year amounted to 27 inches, the rainy season being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Pickford and Black's steamers, running under Government contract, leave Halifax for Turks Islands on the 15th of every month, calling at New York both going and returning. The length of voyage between England and Turks Islands is nineteen days via New York, and eighteen days via Halifax or Jamaica.

The Clyde Line from New York to Hayti calls at Turks Island every three weeks, the length of the voyage being six days. There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony.

The estimated number of letters to the United Kingdom is 2,000, and to all other countries 12,000 annually.

The rate of letter postage is 2½d. per half ounce. There is no internal post.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, distant nine miles.

Education.

There are seven elementary schools supported by the Government, with an attendance in 1895 of 718 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free. A compulsory education clause, providing also for the payment of fees, was passed in 1883, but the compulsory clauses have never been proclaimed.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of English sterling, United States gold and silver, Spanish, Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons, and Jamaican nickel tokens. There is no limit to the tender of silver. There is no paper currency. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1895, 144 depositors, with £992. deposit.

Constitution.

The legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure, and all local matters, are regulated by this Board, but laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands, take effect there.

The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, and the custody of lunatics have been so dealt with.
