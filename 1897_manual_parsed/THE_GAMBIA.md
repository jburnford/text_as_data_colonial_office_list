THE GAMBIA.

Situation and Area.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary, measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than half a mile between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Combo, Allotau, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, 153 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river. The total area of the Colony proper is about 10 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey).
History.

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators, but they made no settlement. In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to the merchants in Exeter to trade with the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed. It was not successful, and another establishment two years later also failed. In 1664 a fort was built on the island, now known as Fort James. In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade (1807) till 1816, when a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary by British merchants from Senegal.

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France in the treaty of 1783, with the exception of a French factory which was subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. These two exceptional rights were exchanged in 1857.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to that Act of Parliament in 1821, till in 1843 it was declared an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate government in 1888.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the Island of Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1827 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1827; and British Combo was granted by the King of Combo in various sessions in 1840, 1850, and 1860.

Industry.

The principal productions of the settlement and the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, copra, rice, cotton, maize, corn, palm kernels, manioc, wax, and native "pagans" or country stuffs. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths called pagans, the manufacture of vegetable oils, boat building, and some basket making, there are no manufacturing industries in the country.

A considerable entrepot trade is done with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts, in cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, rice, ground nuts, and hardware. In 1892 cotton goods to the value of 34,461l. were imported, 159,869 lbs. of copra, 857,415 lbs. of cola nuts, 38,876 gals. of spirits of various kinds, 20,728 gals. of wine, 1,250 cwts. of sugar, 1,250 tons of salt, 305 barrels of gunpowder, and 27,029 cwts. of rice. The quantities and values of the principal exports in 1892 were: Ground nuts, 21,282 tons, value 150,207l.; rubber, 1,614 lbs., value 2,920l.; palm kernels, 3,390 tons, value 1,176l.; wax, 73,580 lbs., value 2,267l.; and hides to the value of 1,721l. Most of the exports go to France, but half of the imports come from England.

Bathurst is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1895, 113 vessels registered, of 1,954 tons in the aggregate. The ground nut is the staple product of the Settlement. It is planted in June, and reaped in November, and largely exported to the South of Europe for the extraction of oil. The industry began in 1845, reached its climax in 1858, and has since declined, owing to the competition of other oil materials.

Relations with the Interior.

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the Protectorate by the Anglo-French Commissioners in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the Protectorate gradually into closer relationship with the Government of the Colony. An Order-in-Council, issued on the 23rd of November, 1893, provided for the establishment of Her Majesty's jurisdiction within the Protectorate, and since then an Ordinance has been passed providing for the establishment of magistrates and also native courts.

Travelling Commissioners regularly, during the eight months of dry weather, travel through the Protectorate on both banks of the river for 120 miles, and in Kombo and Fogni. These parts of the Protectorate are gradually getting more under the immediate control of the Government. A "yard" or "hut" tax, which will average about 4s. per annum for a family, has been recently imposed in the Protectorate.

Stipends are paid and frequent presents made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the trade routes open.

In the early part of the year 1881 an expedition was made under the command of Dr. Gouldsbury, Administrator, for the purpose of ascertaining the capabilities of the upper river as a highway for trade between the coast and the interior, and of reaching Timbo, the capital of the extensive Fouta Jallon country. From thence the expedition returned to the coast at Sierra Leone, its report showing that but little extension of trade could be hoped for.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is that of the Latin Union; there is no Colonial coinage and no note issue. A Government savings bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec., 1894, 2,436l. deposited by 126 depositors, but there are no private banks.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants in aid. There is one Anglican school, 8 Mohammedan, 3 Wesleyan, and 2 Roman Catholic, with about 1,400 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory, and fees are charged.

Means of Communication.

The Liverpool mail steamers call every fortnight, and there is also communication via Dakar with Bordeaux. Four telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs, or metalled roads, save one from Bathurst to Cape St. Mary 7½ miles across the Oyster Creek Bridge, which connects the island of St. Mary with the mainland of British Combo. Horses will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 250 miles. A Government steamer now runs weekly to and from McCarthy's Island, stopping at intermediate places, carrying 1st-class passengers at 2d. per mile and deck passengers at 1d. per mile, letters at 1d. each, and affording freight and towage according to a fixed tariff.
