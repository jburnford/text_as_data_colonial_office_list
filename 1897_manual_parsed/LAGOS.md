LAGOS.

The Colony itself consists of the coast line from the boundary of the French Protectorate of the kingdom of Porto Novo (the river Ajarra) on the west, to Aboto on the Mahin Beach on the east, and includes Badagry, Lagos Island (the capital of the Colony), Ebute Metta, and Iddo Island, Ikorodu, Ejinrin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and the Mahin Beach.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (acquired August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi to the Ogun River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the Interior.

The Protectorate comprises the kingdoms of Okra, Okedan, Ilaro, Addo, and Igbessa, with the Awori Country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Iddo, and Jakri, up to the right bank of the Benin River on the east, where it adjoins the territory of the Niger Coast Protectorate.

For administrative purposes the country is divided into the central, the western, the northern, the eastern, and the north-eastern districts, with district commissioners stationed respectively at Lagos, Badagry, Ikorodu, Leckie, and Epe. In the Hinterland, resident officers are stationed at Ibadan, Jebu Ode, Shagamu, and at Otin. There is also a superintendent of native affairs at Abeokuta.

Lagos Island has an area of 3½ square miles, and the whole Colony and Protectorate probably includes about 1,500 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass.

History.

The King of Lagos (Kosoko), having refused to cooperate in putting down the slave trade, was visited by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown, in consideration of a pension of £1,000 a-year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief, at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further letters patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Ketoum, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Ketoum, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

In 1890, Ketoum was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

An expedition was sent against the Jebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

Constitution.

The Government is conducted by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The latter includes four nominated unofficial members. The law consists entirely of local ordinances and Orders in Council, with such English Acts as are of general application.

The Colony is associated with Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast Colony in contributing towards the salary of the Bishop of Sierra Leone and towards the subsidy paid for telegraph maintenance. It also contributes towards the total cost of the audit of the accounts of the Gold Coast Colony and Lagos by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.

Industry.

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, and brickmaking. A saw mill has recently been established, and native builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths do fair work.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the inland waters, the fish being dried and sent into the interior.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. A very extensive trade has therefore grown up, amounting, in 1893, to over a million and a half sterling. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, country cloths, rum, geneva, specie, and tobacco. The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France. The quantities and values of the principal exports during 1893 were palm kernels, 46,501 tons, value 320,434l.; palm oil, 3,826,392 gals., value 205,535l.; cotton goods, value 29,143l.; country cloths, value 3,751l.; rum, 146,7003 gals., value 6,474l.; geneva, 6,148 gals., value 484l.; specie, 100,789l.; tobacco, 361,961½ lbs., value 6,761l.; rubber, 5,069,576½ lbs., value 269,893l.

Chief Towns.

Lagos town has now about 33,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the whole West African coast. Epe is probably the largest town in the Colony outside Lagos, population about 6,000. The next largest towns are Badagry, with a population of 4,022, Leckie, and Ikorodu.
Currency and Banking.

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with some Spanish, American, and French gold coins. Cowries (80 = ½d.), are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders. A Government savings bank was established on the 1st January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on 31st August, 1895, held deposits amounting to £9,410L 19s. 10½d.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged in a company named The Bank of British West Africa.

Means of Communication.

There are no railways or internal telegraphs, but Lagos Island is now in telegraphic communication with the Congo, South Africa, Bonny and Brass, the Gold Coast, and Europe, and via Accra, with the Gaboon, Loanda, Kutoum, and Porto Novo. There is also a weekly mail service to and from these places, and communication about once a month with Hamburg. With Brazil and the United States there is frequent communication by sailing vessels. The internal communication is chiefly by water, along the network of lagoons. There is telephonic communication between the various government offices.

Money Orders are issued at a commission of 2d. for every 10s., or portion of 10s., for sums not exceeding 20l. For sums above 20l. commission is charged at the rate of 5 per cent.

In 1894–98, 290 letters, 3,779 postcards, 84,052 book packets, samples, and circulars, and 2,478 parcels were dealt with in the Lagos Post Office. The value of money orders sent from Lagos was 8,847l. 4s. 4d.; received in Lagos, 6,373l. 3s. 9d.

Education.

There are no Government schools, but a system of Government inspection and examination has been introduced under the supervision of an Education Board and a Local Inspector of Schools, under which grants were made during the past year to the schools of the various Christian denominations amounting in all to £1,514; about 3,276 school children are on the school rolls. Fees are charged, and education is not compulsory. The Mohammedans, who are much on the increase, maintain their own schools, where Arabic is taught, but have not responded to offers of Government assistance.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The mean temperature is 81°, the extreme max being from 68° to 91°. The rainy season extends from May to October, a lull occurring generally in July and August. The annual rainfall is about 70 inches.

The native inhabitants are mainly of the Yoruba race; about one-fourth of them speak English. There are about 200 persons of European birth in the Colony.

Defence.

There is an armed force of Hausa consisting of 844 men, and a civil police numbering 150. The Hausa force is armed with the Martini-Henry carbines and the civil police with Snider rifles.
