CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 53' and 9° 51' N. lat. and 79° 41' and 81° 54' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 266 miles; its
The greatest width 140½ miles, from Colombo on the west coast, to Sangemankande on the east. Its area is 25,365 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldivian Archipelago, 500 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probable Aryan origin stock, speaking a dialect akin to Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000, the people being well governed, and energetic traders and seamen. Mali, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands were transferred to the Government of the Straits Settlements in 1886.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustan. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,865 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual rainfall is about 100 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November.

History.

The great Indian epic, the Ramayana, has a chapter describing Ceylon at least ten centuries before the Christian era, but the authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced 306 B.C., and from that date this faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

Constitution.

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secretary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen, are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

Defence.

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo, Kandy, and Trincomalee, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the European garrison, the strength being 1,582 men. The Colonial contribution for 1895 was Rs. 1,540,499. Trincomalee is a fortified Naval Station, and possesses an Admiralty dockyard. Colombo harbour is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of Dec., 1895, consisted of 1,157 of all ranks.

Population, Area, and Statistics.

The population of Ceylon was ascertained by the Census taken in 1881 to be 2,763,984, being an increase of 14·67 per cent. on the population of 1871. The present population is 3,008,466, according to the census of 1891, the details of which are as follows (including the military, shipping, and estates):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 763,187    |
| Central ditto             | 474,487    |
| Northern ditto            | 319,193    |
| Southern ditto            | 489,761    |
| Eastern ditto             | 148,727    |
| North-Western Province    | 320,032    |
| North-Central ditto       | 75,319     |
| Province of Uva           | 159,155    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa  | 258,605    |

Total 3,008,466

Among these are about 8,000 Europeans, 21,000 Burghers and Eurasians, 200,000 Moormen, 10,000 Malays, 2,000,000 Sinhalese, and three-quarters of a million Tamils. The Buddhists number more than half the population; there are about 600,000 Hindus, 200,000 Mohammedans, and 302,000 Christians. The population of the chief towns was as follows: Colombo, 126,926; Kandy, 20,252; Galle, 33,505; Trincomalee, 11,411; Jaffna, 48,092; Badulla, 5,548; Kurunegala, 4,676; Anuradhapura, 2,497.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea and coffee estates, &c., is about 200,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 250,000.

The area of the Colony is 25,365 square miles, or 16,253,600 acres; and rather more than one-fifth of this, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. About 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from
1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level. The most important products are:

| Product   | Acres |
|-----------|-------|
| Rice      | 589,077 |
| Other Grain | 138,663 |
| Coffee    | 22,475 |
| Tea       | 322,810 |
| Cinchona  | 4,336 |
| Coconuts  | 862,582 |
| Cinnamon  | 40,475 |
| Tobacco   | 11,067 |
| Cocoa     | 28,319 |

There are 299 plumbago mines in the island, giving an aggregate yield of over 23,000 tons of mineral every year, the value of which may be roughly estimated at over Rs. 3,353,000. There are 361 gem quarries.

The pearl fisheries, for which Ceylon is famous, are carried on on the banks which fringe the east coast. They have for many years been carried on by the Government itself.

The revenue derived from this source fluctuates considerably, as appears from the following statements:

- 1860, Rs. 375,120; 1874, Rs. 101,587; 1879, Rs. 84,567; 1880, Rs. 200,152; 1881, Rs. 599,533; 1884, Rs. 33,658; 1887, Rs. 400,766; 1888, Rs. 804,312; 1889, Rs. 499,201; 1890, Rs. 315,452.

The highest price realised by the sale of the pearl oysters was in 1860, the average being Rs. 129 per thousand. There was a very successful fishery in 1891, which realised Rs. 961,542, the largest revenue since 1814.

The upset price of Crown land is ten rupees an acre, and forest land suitable for coffee cultivation has fetched as much as 230 rupees.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs duties, land sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Badulla, Ratnapura, and Kegalla, amounted in 1895 to 2,073,299 rupees, and their expenditure in the same year to 1,989,099 rupees.

The municipal debt on 31st December, 1895, was 281,477 rupees. Of this amount 214,916 rupees is the balance unpaid out of a loan of 250,000 rupees for the construction of water works at Kandy, and 66,561 rupees balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle in 1890 for the construction of water works.

The value of coffee exported in 1895 was 5,856,546 rupees; the greater part of it, to the value of 4,158,948 rupees, being shipped to the United Kingdom. Cinchona, rated at 73,585 rupees, and tea 49,290,530 rupees, respectively, were exported. The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1886, 7,849,888 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,799,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; 1894, 85,370,322 lbs.; and 1895, 98,571,060 lbs. The other exports are coconut oil, kernels, coir, copra, and desiccated coconut, cacao, cinnamon, cardamoms, citronella oil, plumbago, and tobacco.

The exports are mainly to the United Kingdom, some going however to India, the United States, the Continent of Europe, and Australia. The imports are mainly rice from India, and textile and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch, much modified by the introduction of English and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts or Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all causes whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Grama Sabhas, or Village Councils, instituted under Ordinance No. 26 of 1871, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings but undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1895 was 44,232, in schools aided by Government 90,229, and in unaided schools 35,353, making altogether a total of 169,834.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was 632,819, as compared with 1868, when the number of scholars was 6,879; the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education, small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local efforts, owing to retrenchment, the Department having been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by the Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid Schools. One Government scholarship of Rs. 100 for 4 years, to be spent at an English University, is awarded annually.

There is one school of agriculture at Colombo, which was opened at the beginning of 1894, and there are 10 branch institutions officered by young men trained in the Colombo School of Agriculture. Six of these men are paid by Government.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are ten. A central Technical Institute was founded in Colombo in 1893.
There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Senior and the Junior. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A licence to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Senior department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. The members of the Junior department, after a training of three years, and after passing the prescribed examinations, are qualified to serve as medical practitioners, hospital assistants, dispensers and vaccinators. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 107 students attending during the session 1894-95, of whom 64 (57 males and 7 females) belonged to the Senior, and 43 (39 males and 4 females) to the Junior department.

The Government maintains 46 hospitals exclusive of those for infectious diseases and sick prisoners, two asylums, one for lunatics and the other for lepers, and 167 dispensaries, of which 46 are attached to hospitals, and 121 independent institutions. Besides these, there are 15 hospitals with dispensaries attached, and 29 independent dispensaries in the planting districts, to afford medical aid to 1,622 estates, scheduled to 32 districts, and 25 sub-districts. There is a government medical staff consisting of one principal civil medical officer and inspector-general of hospitals, 64 officers having British qualifications, of whom one is a lady, 52 having licences of the Ceylon Medical College, 90 medical assistants of local training, 115 dispensers and hospital assistants, 7 inspectors of vaccination, and 100 vaccinators, of whom 4 are females, distributed throughout the island. The cost of working the department amounted in 1895 to Rs. 1,415,907-51, the sum of Rs. 369,649-99 being on account of estate medical aid. The receipts, which include cost of maintenance of paying patients in hospitals, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, etc., amounted to Rs. 188,319-88. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estate Branch of the Department yielded Rs. 97,853-40.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is exclusively Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, which is alone legal tender. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pie. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1894, the Government has instituted a note-issue, of which the amount on the 31st December, 1895, was Rs. 10,165,000. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon. The Chartered Mercantile Bank had Rs. 4,355,600, the Madras Bank Rs. 6,882,828, and the National Bank Rs. 1,187,916 deposits in the island on 31st December, 1890. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank had Rs. 51,165 in deposit on 31st December, 1893.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885, and the two together had on 31st December, 1895, Rs. 4,168,337 deposited.

Public Works.

The Colombo South-West Breakwater was commenced in 1875, and was completed in 1885. A single arm composed of large concrete blocks on a rubble foundation running from the shore, a distance of 4,200 feet in a northerly direction, terminates with a slight curve.

In 1893 a Northern Arm, a North-West Breakwater, and the reclamation of 26 acres on the east side of the harbour were sanctioned, and work in connection with these commenced in May, 1894.

The Northern Arm to be a rubble embankment, 1,000 feet long, in a westerly direction with an entrance 700 feet wide between it and the North-West Breakwater.

The North-West breakwater to be similar in construction to the South-West breakwater, 2,670 feet long, in a south-westerly direction, with an entrance 800 feet wide between the breakwaters.

The total expenditure on the Harbour from 1873 to 31st December, 1895, Rs. 13,006,135-20.

Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a great reservoir at Labugama 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoir at Maligakanda, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was Rs. 4,330,000.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—7,005 miles are open in Ceylon. There are 297 miles of railway, all owned and worked by the Government.

The lines of railway are distributed thus:—Colombo to Kandy (74½ miles), Kandy and Matale (17¾ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Bunderawela (91¼ miles), Mahara Quarry and Mahara Points (1¼ miles), Fort Junction and Wharf (1¼ miles), Maradana Junction to Galle (71¾ miles), Gallo and Matara (26¾ miles), Polgahawelle and Kurunegala (13 miles). The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1895, charged in accounts, was Rs. 52,866,796*. The receipts during 1895, Rs. 6,222,735, and the expenditure Rs. 3,093,266. Of metalled roads there are 2,221-45 miles; of gravelled and natural roads, 699-68 and 508-70 miles; of canals, 163-25 miles. The maintenance of 3,429-63 miles of road cost, in 1895, Rs. 1,124,777-84*, or an average rate of Rs. 327-94 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees who collect the commutation received during 1895 a revenue of Rs. 993,662 rupees; but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. The amount expended in 1895 was Rs. 977,186. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the

construction of new water works. The amount expended on irrigation in 1895 was Rs. 268,218-71.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia. 2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles, Ceylon, Straits and China, and India, by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. 3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Navigation Company. 4. A fortnightly service by the steamers of the Norddeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company between Europe and Ceylon. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia and China by these steamers. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 15 to 18 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 5, 6, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, which is carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company.

Letters, &c., from England reach Colombo in about 17 days (14 minimum, 18 maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the Clan Line, the City Line, &c. The steamers of the first leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Montevideo. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roche in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually icebound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1584. In 1690 they were taken possession of by Francis Bougainville planted a small colony at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville bought out by Spain, ever jealous of invasion by other nations in the southern seas, in 1765. The following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774. No further formal occupation made till in 1829. Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under charge of the Naval officers engaged in the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service from 1884-5, since which date it has been supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 694. There is a small port at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1895, six vessels of a total tonnage of 249 tons. It has a fine inner harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going to Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 159 pupils, 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 21 pupils; a Roman Catholic school, at Stanley, with 37 pupils; also a Baptist school with 56 on its roll, and a travelling schoolmaster with 28 pupils. The attendance is about two-thirds of the number on the rolls.

The climate is healthy, though severe. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The thermometer rises at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. In winter the weather is boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. The thermometer rises from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 60° in summer. The average annual rainfall is 20 inches. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the peat is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Such as two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

In the main the Islands are a wild stretch of moorland, but there is a great variety of scentless flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to a height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast, the grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in the wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, &c., besides a small plant called the tansy, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos.
The main industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Argentina. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were, in 1895—3,250 sheep, 6,850 cattle, 791,442 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general stores, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. On April, 1888, a Government savings bank of usual type was established, in which on 30th September, 1895, the deposits were £34,415, belonging to 282 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the remnants of the stock introduced by the Spanish settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep raising on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 97,128 acres leased from the Government. The importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is £100,000, all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by A. E. Wilson, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Lafonia.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every 21 days. The German "Kosmos" Steamship Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao and on the return voyage, every three weeks. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails to the Falkland Islands are also carried by the same Company's steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom is 1s. per oz.; to the rest of Europe and foreign countries 1½d. per oz.; there is an internal post of ½d. Parcel postage to London, 9d. per lb. The nearest point in telegraphic communication in Europe is Monte Video. There is a light-house at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of £600.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Judge, the Colonial Secretary, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Signet and Signet for five years.

### FIJI.

#### Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 23° S., between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 55 miles to the north-east. The French colony of Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles.

The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere unoccupied rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of islands, rocks, reefs, between 12° and 15° S., between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Taviuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,433 square miles (about equal to Wales).

#### Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the sea to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly wooded and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in lime acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterized by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long rank grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent falls keep alive the sources of the thousands of affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for...
ts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles in its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, sources of which lie in the high mountains of interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, the rivers, with many others, drain the principal ephemeral of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the streams are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has a stream or brook, from which the native occupants rear their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through channels usually found opposite to the most convenient valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 179° 10' E. long., was discovered by the "Bounty" in 1789, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofia, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains a small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 19, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is taro, of which about 300 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a separate government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, presides. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner, the chiefs, and magistrates), whose enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 180,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881 and 1891 respectively, was found to be as follows:

| Year | Total |
|------|-------|
| 1881 | 66,367 |
| 1891 | 121,180 |

The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect inasmuch as there was then a tendency on the part of the natives to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made, that tendency had taken a turn in the opposite direction, under the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The birth and death returns furnished during the ten years, and believed to be fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 4,500 in the native Fijian population. The births among the native population in 1895 were 3,644, and the deaths 5,166. The birth rate was 35-96, and the death rate 50-98 per mil. The death rate among native children is excessive.
Indian immigration has almost taken the place of Polynesian immigration, hence the respective increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are both cheaper and more suitable than Polynesians for work on sugar plantations. The Indian immigrant population is now about 10,000.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1895:

- Wesleyan ... ... ... 97,254
- Roman Catholic Mission ... ... 9,430

Total ... 106,684

**History.**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the "Bounty," sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the Island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

**Climate.**

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1895 was 93° in the months of February and March, and the lowest 60° in July. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 109-00 inches. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

**Constitution.**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and four official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of cases of land, under Ordinance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carter.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and six official and six non-official nominated members. To the natives a share of self-government has been conceded; a system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as European capital, but during the year 1881 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, a fine harbour. The white population of town and suburbs numbered 834 at the census of 1891. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had on 31st December, 1891, vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,360 tons. During the year 1895 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 109 vessels, a total tonnage of 1,360; of these 39 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 776), and 70 by natives (tonnage 584).

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000l. to 19,000l. net, is raised from taxes of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces, exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu, each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce. Produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, tobacco, yagona (Macropiper methysticum), maize, beche-de-mer, and occasionally green bananas and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar factories under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item of which native taxes are paid) and cotton are sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received.

Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by tender or by public auction as the quantity at any time to time contributed, and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Rokos, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is a further subdivision among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by a Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of...
The amount thus returned in 1895 was £2,637, and the control of the department of native taxation was in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Suva, and in 1892 one was established in Levuka. The transfer of the seat of government. These towns are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town consists of members elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected for roads and house property. General rates are assessed to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of ratable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are also provided for.

An annual grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the rate raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town council.

The revenue and expenditure in 1895 were: Suva town board, £1,670.; ditto school board, £1,537.; Levuka town board, £1,554., and school board, £723.; ditto school board, £632., and £612.

Total receipts of local authorities, £4,991.; total expenditure, £3,854., in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above mentioned.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within each constituted district (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the school boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant based on average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council, and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. Fees are charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for instruction in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva with 94 scholars, and another in Levuka with 123 scholars on the roll.

There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka (attendance 34), and one in Suva, with an attendance of 84.

There is a Government technical school on the island of Vitilevu, within ten miles of Suva, where native youths are instructed in primary education, planting, boat building, and other industrial pursuits. The school is partly self-supporting.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 2,013 pupils, with 2,610 native teachers, and 34,966 scholars. The latter have 141 schools, with 2,007 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New Zealand has two branches in Fiji—at Suva and Levuka.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the cocoanut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. Since that date the cultivation of kidney cotton has revived, and now gives indications of expansion. In the meantime, the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney. This trade increased year by year, until it ranked as the export second only in importance to that of sugar.

The quantity of fruit exported during the year 1892 was 788,100 bunches of bananas, 5,555 cases, and 3 packages (pineapples for the most part), and 65 cwts. of dried fruit, which, valued at £s. 6d. per bunch and 12s. per package on an average, amounts to £2,564., but owing to the competition of Queensland and the maintenance of high rates of freight from Fiji the export fell, in 1893, to 348,599 bunches, and 17,421 cases of fruit, valued at £36,597. In 1894 a slight increase was experienced, the export having amounted to 390,746 bunches and 33,014 cases of fruit, valued at £49,114. In 1895 the export was only 114,024 bunches of fruit, 20,725 cases of fruit, valued at £20,986 16s. 0d. This falling off has been due to disease locally, and to competition combined with the results of general depression in the Australian and New Zealand fruit markets. The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadillas, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the expansion of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar Quantity | Value | Fruit Quantity | Value | Copra Quantity | Value |
|------|----------------|-------|----------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| 1875 | 36             | £3,417| 97             | £3,871| 40,058         |
| 1880 | 503            | £20,920| 5,216          | £7,339| 109,758        |
| 1890 | 15,291         | £244,655| 57,563         | £4,657| 42,901         |
| 1891 | 20,470         | £327,526| 61,573         | £6,669| 53,039         |
| 1892 | 19,883         | £302,133| 62,564         | £6,067| 50,812         |
| 1893 | 15,399         | £246,231| 36,599         | £4,790| 42,235         |
| 1894 | 27,265         | £436,245| 49,115         | £5,843| 57,261         |
| 1895 | 23,210         | £208,889| 20,987         | £10,908| 94,084         |

The other principal exports in 1895 consisted of:—Peanuts, 87 tons, valued at £1,623.; cotton
5 tons, valued at £46l.; cocoanuts, 8,849 sacks, valued at £62l.; wool, valued at £24l. Minor exports consist of arrowroot, bark, ginger, tortoise shell, gum, angora hair, hides, mats, pearl shell, plants and seeds, sandal wood, tea, tobacco, turtles, yams, cocoanuts, wool, and béche-de-mer.

The cultivation of a superior class of tobacco, specially adapted for use as cigar wrappers, is being entered on by Europeans. The growth of rice has also been commenced, and notwithstanding the unfavourable state of the markets the cultivation of sugar cane is being extended.

About 90 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through those colonies.

Means of Communication.

The number of letters, newspapers, and book packets received and despatched by the Post Office during the year 1895 is given in the following statement:

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony: Sydney (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Auckland (4 days), fortnightly, in connection with the San Francisco Mail Service. Many of these steamers run during the sugar season. Since the end of 1893, Suva has been a port of call of the Canadian-Australian line of steamers running between Sydney and Vancouver. The Colony joins the other Australian Colonies in subsidising the mail service by the Peninsula and Orient and Orient lines of mail steamers.

Postage to the United Kingdom, via Vancouver or via Brindisi, 2½d. per ¼ oz., via San Francisco 5d.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand 2d. per ¼ oz. Internal postal rates: town country 2d. per ¼ oz.; newspapers 1d. A Post Office with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is twopence for the first 2 lbs., and one shilling per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on September, 1891.

Letters from England sent via Sydney to Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco in about forty-three days, and letters via Vancouver in about thirty-five days.

There is no railway or telegraph in the colony. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Auckland (N.Z.) and Sydney (N.S.W.). Intercommunication within the colony is maintained by sailing boats and steam launch and by an inter-insular steamer. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands.
