The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Montevideo. They consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles (equal to Gloucestershire). Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S., and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roche in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited, and almost perpetually icebound. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles (equal to Wales).

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1584. In 1690 they were taken possession of by Francis Bougainville planted a small colony at Port Louis on E. Falkland. Bougainville bought out by Spain, ever jealous of invasion by other nations in the southern seas, in 1765. The following year Captain Byron took possession of W. Falkland, and left a small garrison which was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. It was restored next year, but abandoned in 1774. No further formal occupation made till in 1829. Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under charge of the Naval officers engaged in the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants from 1841 to 1880, and for mail service from 1884-5, since which date it has been supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 694. There is a small port at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1895, six vessels of a total tonnage of 249 tons. It has a fine inner harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going to Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 159 pupils, 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 21 pupils; a Roman Catholic school, at Stanley, with 37 pupils; also a Baptist school with 56 on its roll, and a travelling schoolmaster with 28 pupils. The attendance is about two-thirds of the number on the rolls.

The climate is healthy, though severe. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The thermometer rises at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. In winter the weather is boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. The thermometer rises from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 60° in summer. The average annual rainfall is 20 inches. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the peat is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Such as two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

In the main the Islands are a wild stretch of moorland, but there is a great variety of scentless flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to a height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast, the grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in the wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, &c., besides a small plant called the tansy, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos.
The main industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to Chili and Argentina. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were, in 1895—3,250 sheep, 6,850 cattle, 791,442 sheep.

The chief export is wool. The other exports consist of frozen mutton, sheep skins, hides, horns, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, general stores, and ship's stores.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. On April, 1888, a Government savings bank of usual type was established, in which on 30th September, 1895, the deposits were £34,415, belonging to 282 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the remnants of the stock introduced by the Spanish settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep raising on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 97,128 acres leased from the Government. The importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is £100,000, all paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by A. E. Wilson, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Lafonia.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England every 21 days. The German "Kosmos" Steamship Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao and on the return voyage, every three weeks. The voyage between Stanley and London occupies four weeks. Mails to the Falkland Islands are also carried by the same Company's steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to the United Kingdom is 1s. per oz.; to the rest of Europe and foreign countries 1½d. per oz.; there is an internal post of ½d. Parcel postage to London, 9d. per lb. The nearest point in telegraphic communication in Europe is Monte Video. There is a light-house at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of £600.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Judge, the Colonial Secretary, and the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Signet and Signet for five years.
