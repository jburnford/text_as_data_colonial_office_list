CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Minor to the north and Syria to the east; distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It is between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, its area is 3,581 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the largest island in the Mediterranean, being exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, the great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range is the Carpus Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, form a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the less extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the central and south-western portions of the island, trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminating in the isolated peak called Santa Anna, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,400 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern side are the summer quarters of the English troops of the High Commissioner who administers Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mere torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalis.

History.

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Roman Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King of Jerusalem, and united the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 to 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, her Venetian and widow of James II, having succeeded her husband and his posthumous son, James III,
Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but with the exception of a concession granted in 1886, and since abandoned, they have not been worked in recent times. Gypsum is exported in a raw state from the Carpas mostly to Syria, and manufactured, i.e., in the form of plaster of Paris from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these two places it is mostly sent to Egypt. The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carob, wine, cotton, linseed, aniseed, silk, cheese, wool, fruit, and vegetables.

The carobs and cereals are exported mainly to the United Kingdom, France, and Egypt.

Cyprus wine is somewhat heady for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it acquires from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice has for some time been discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels. A company called "The Cyprus Company,"* was in operation, which manufactures wine more suitable for the European market, and undertakes other industrial operations.

Wine, since the extra duty was imposed in France has found a fairly good demand in Egypt.

Since the year 1883, when direct and regular communication with Egypt terminated, the production of fruit and vegetables, for which the island is well adapted, has not developed, but now that direct communication has again been secured considerable progress in this industry is anticipated.

The agriculture has been greatly retarded by want of water, the rainfall being deficient, and much of what does fall being allowed to run to waste. A scheme, however, for storing water for irrigation is now under the consideration of Her Majesty's Government.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts are then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they cannot emerge. This system, as the locusts are now more scattered, has been experimentally discarded in favour of a system of collecting live locusts and locust eggs.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-forestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the large number of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains more than any other country.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power is given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges.

* Now in liquidation.
for fishing the coasts for sponges, but the law has not yet been taken advantage of. The value of the fishing may be put at from 20,000l., to 30,000l. a year.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round except at the seaport towns.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, alcohol, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, linseed, aniseed, olive oil, silk, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, gypsum, and terra nigra.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council which came into operation on the 1st August, 1882, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign, half-sovereign, Turkish lira, and French 20-franc piece. Silver, the florin, shilling, sixpence, and three-pence, limit of tender 3l. Bronze, the piastre (nine equal to one shilling), half piastre; quarter piastre; limit of tender, 27 piastres.

The Imperial Ottoman Bank has branches or agencies established at Larnaca, Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos, and Kyrenia.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oké = 2½ lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum = about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

There is no railway or navigable waterway in the island, but roads between all important places are now maintained. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 240 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria, and Smyrna and Constantinople by the "Austrian Lloyd," "Messageries Maritimes," and "Russian" steamers, and negotiations have been completed with Bell's Co. for a weekly contract service with Egypt. There are also frequent direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers |
|-----------------------------|
| Within the island ½ c.p.     |
| England 2½ "                |

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the island.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882.

There are about 200 elementary schools in connection with the Greek Orthodox church, which receive aid amounting to about 2,500l. And there are about 80 elementary Moslem schools, which receive aid amounting to about 730l.

An Armenian school in Nicosia and a Maronite school in the village of Kormakilir, are also aided by Government.

A Rushdir or Moslem High school is entirely by the Government at a cost of about 2,000l. a year; and a grant of 200l. a year is given to a Greek gymnasium at Nicosia, which provides required training for teachers of Greek and elementary schools.

There is also a Greek high school at Larnaca and another at Limassol, which are assisted by Government.

In accordance with a law passed in 1885 by the Board of Education have recently been established to regulate the Moslem schools and to regulate the Greek Christian schools. There is also in each district town a District Committee for Moslem schools, and a District Committee for Greek Christian schools, presided over in each case by the Commissioner of the district.

The total enrolment is about 14,000 Moslems and 10,500 Christians.

Leprosy.

Prior to the British occupation, little attention was made for lepers in the leper asylum near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor in the century.

The asylum has been greatly improved, new houses of an improved class having been erected, and the accommodation thus increased. The welfare of the inmates has been a matter of considerable attention, and a recreation room was given to them by the late High Commissioner, Sir H. E. Bulwer, which has greatly enhanced the comfort of the people.

There is now accommodation for over 100 inmates, and the enclosed farm of 200 acres partly cultivated by the lepers, the produce being used on the farm. Each person gets bread, clothing, and fuel, and a good allowance of 2½ copper piastres daily.

No leper quits the farm except on very rare occasions, and then only on urgent business with the permission of the chief medical officer.

The total number of lepers in the asylum returned by the census of 1891, was 106 males and 31 females. On 31st March, there were 93 inmates of the leper farm.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms: the tubercular, and the anaesthetic; of these there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers and even whole members occurs. In this form the skin and mucous membranes are chiefly affected, especially the face and hands. This form is more common, more dreaded, and effects, and more rapid in its termination than either of the two can be called a fatal disease; their average duration is 10–20 years, and lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common in this island among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages and districts of Famagusta, and cases among Moslems are of the greatest rarity. The prevalence of the disease has been proved beyond doubt due to contagion, stimulated by unclean habits, food, and, in a way, malarial cachexy, and undoubtedly the predisposition to the disease is very often hereditary.

A law was passed in 1891 to better regulate the segregation and treatment of lepers, and a superintendent has been appointed, who resides at the asylum, to enforce discipline and superintend the conduct of the lepers.
British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in resisting his Asiatic possessions against Russia in all contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to cede the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Act to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the Convention. The following is the English official version of its provisions:—

That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkem-i-Shérîch) shall continue to exist in the Island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mahometan population of the island.

That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British authorities, the administration of the property, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mahometan schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

That England will pay to the Porto what is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated and determined by the average of the last five years stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified and confirmed, and to the exclusion of the produce of State lands let or sold during that period.

That the Sublime Porte may freely sell those lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arzîye Emâliye Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

That the English Government, through competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily at a fair price, land required for public purposes, or for other public purposes, and which is not cultivated.

That if Russia restores to Turkey Karabakh and other conquests made by her in Armenia in the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be ceded by England, and the Convention of the 4th June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the Island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers usually conferred upon a local Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been repealed by another, dated the 30th November, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six Legislative Members, being office-holders, and nine elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometans and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and others who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:—

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and fine of £1.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to £1.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the Court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkem-i-Shérîch, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:—

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—

   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.

   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.

   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males between 18 and 60 years of age.

3. Tithes of the principal products of the island. (Tithe on cereals taken in kind.)

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of ½ per cent. on tithes and certain incomes (for locust destruction).

9. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike. Tithes on grapes and on certain minor articles have been abolished; carobs and silk cocoons pay tithe only on exportation. An export duty of 12
per cent. is charged on raisins; and cotton, linseed, and aniseed pay an export duty in lieu of tithes. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

There is a military police force of about 670 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its mediaval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1883 by subscription.

**THE NIGER TERRITORIES.**

**Situation and Boundaries.**

Those regions, estimated to cover about 500,000 square miles, and with a population estimated at 20,000,000 to 35,000,000, are secured to Great Britain by nearly 400 treaties made by the Royal Niger Company (formerly the National African Company, Limited), and recognized by the three Anglo-German Agreements of June, 1885; June, 1886; and November, 1893, and the Anglo-French Agreement of August, 1890. The agreements with Germany establish as an eastern frontier a line running from the Cross River to a little east of Yola, on the Upper Benue, and thence to a point on the south bank of Lake Chad 35 minutes east of the meridian of Kuka. The northern frontier of the Territories is settled by the agreement with France, and is to be a line drawn from Say, on the Middle Niger, to Barua, on Lake Chad, but diverted so as to leave within the Niger Territories everything that properly belongs to the kingdom of Sokoto. Under this agreement the Company claims the Saharan provinces of Air, or Ashen, and Damerau; but this claim is contested by France, and will have to be settled by the International Commission referred to in the agreement. The same commission will settle the western frontier between France and the Niger Territories in the great bend of the Niger to the west of Borgu, a powerful pagan kingdom which was, by a treaty dated the 20th January, 1890, brought within the jurisdiction of the Company. Borgu bounds on the north the kingdom of Dahomey, which France has lately conquered. The Territories are separated from the British colony of Lagos by that portion of Yorubaland which has not yet been conquered by the Mohammedans, nor brought within the jurisdiction of any European power. On the Gulf of Guinea the Territories occupy about 106 miles of coastline from the Forcados to the Brass River; the adjacent coast line on either side falling within the British Niger Coast Protectorate, administered by a British Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by a number of vice-consuls. During the early part of 1897 the Company had to send a punitive expedition against the Emir of Nwepé. It was entirely successful, completely defeating the Emir's forces.

The Iborins, whose country lies towards the frontier of the Lagos Protectorate, to which they had occasioned considerable trouble, were also subdued.

**Administration.**

The Niger Territories are governed from London by a Council, of which Sir George Goldie is Governor. The Company exercises its jurisdiction under a Royal Charter, dated 10th July, 1886, by which their sovereign rights in the territories over which they have treaties were received and authorized to be exercised.

Order is maintained in the Territories by native allies, by the Company's fleet of twenty-three steamers, and by a small force of district troops. These consist of English officers and men, 1,000 Houssas, chiefly trained as artillery, and armed with Snider rifles. There is also a police force in each district commanded by local magistrates. The headquarters of the force is at Lokoja, at the junction of the Niger and Benue rivers. The capital, where are situated the court, central gaol, main hospital, and other institutions, is at Asaba, about half way between Lokoja and Akassa, the mouth of the Niger, and the Gulf of Guinea, which is the trading depot, and where are the repairing yards and engineers' works for the fleet of river steamers. A patent slipway—the first in West Africa—has recently been erected at Akassa for the repair of these. The other principal settlements are at Abutshi, Atani, Bakundi, Donga, Egga, Illela, Leaba, Loko, Odeni, and Yola, the last named being about 200 miles south of Lake Chad.

**Climate and Products.**

The lower portion of the Territories, including the Niger delta, has a bad reputation for its climate. In this region are produced the palm oil and kernels which form a large portion of the exports from the Territories.

The regions further inland are said to be much healthier, while their principal produce is rubber, hides, ground nuts, shea butter, palm oil, chilies, and various drugs.

The chief imports are cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, powder, salt, silks, spirits, sugar, tea, &c., into any part of the Territories. The Company also prohibited the importation of spirits into the upper portions of their territories, and paid heavy duties on their introduction into the lower portions, so that the importation of spirits is now less than one-fourth of what it was before the duty was imposed. There are no import duties excepting on tobacco, powder, salt, spirits, and tobacco. The revenue is chiefly raised by export duties.

The revenue and trade of the Company were as follows:

| Years | Revenue (£) | Imports (£) |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 1887  | 42,396     | 73,819     |
| 1888  | 53,771     | 120,878    |
| 1889  | 57,652     | 139,465    |
| 1890  | 62,430     | 180,692    |
| 1891  | 89,067     | 224,729    |
| 1892  | 103,155    | 181,012    |
| 1893  | 110,756    | 159,989    |
Means of Communication.

There are telegraph stations at Brass and Bonny, communication with Lagos, and thus with regular steamers arrive and depart from Lagos and the West Coast of Africa every week. Communication in the Niger Basin is mainly by the steamers of the Royal Niger Company.
