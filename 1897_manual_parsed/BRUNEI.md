BRUNEI.

An agreement, in terms similar to that with Sarawak, was concluded, in 1888, with the Sultan of Brunei, a native state lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. Brunei is the state out of which the territories of the North Borneo Company and the Rajah of Sarawak have been carved, and appears to have been at one time powerful, claiming jurisdiction over the greater part of Borneo as well as over the Philippines. Its area is now only about 3,000 miles.

The chief town is Brunei, which has considerable commerce with Singapore.

An Order in Council was passed on 22nd November, 1890, establishing consular courts in Borneo, with an appeal to the supreme court of the Straits Settlements.

There are no European inhabitants. Population estimated at 15,000, principally Malays. Commerce—a large trade in sago is kept up with Labuan and Singapore. A steamer of 378 tons calls there every three weeks. Harbour dues are exacted. Opium and gambling farms are let yearly. Royalties are charged on spices, tea, salt, &c. Duties are exacted on sago and rice.

British Consul, Noel Paul Trevenen.
