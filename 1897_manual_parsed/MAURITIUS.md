MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 49' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 940 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 705 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), having an extreme length of 36 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 28 miles from east to west. The Dependencies have an area of 172 square miles.

The formation of the island is supposed to be volcanic, and it is surrounded by reefs of coral. The mountain chains average 2,000 feet in altitude. The highest peak, the Piton de la Rivière-Noire is 2,711 English feet, and Pieter Both and the Pouce are only a few feet lower. The island is watered by numerous streams, commonly flowing in deep ravines, with several fine cascades; none of these rivers are navigable beyond a few hundred yards from the sea.

History.

The island was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507, but the first people that occupied it in any numbers were the Dutch, in 1598, whose commander, Admiral J. C. Van Neck, named it Mauritius, in honour of the then Stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. The Dutch, however, did not make any permanent settlement, and finally abandoned the island in 1712. A few Frenchmen landed there in 1715, and in 1717 formally took possession of the island on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the King of France. The name of the island was changed by M. Du Fresne, captain in the service of France, into that of Isle of France, which it retained till the landing of the English in 1810, when its former name of Mauritius was again restored to it. The most celebrated French Governor was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735–1746), "a man of eminent talents and virtues" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane, of many other valuable plants, and was the founder of the prosperity of the island.

Mauritius was during the earlier part of the war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, from the facility with which stores were made from it by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an operation for its capture, which was effected in 1810, laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The island was visited by a terrible hurricane on the 29th of April, 1892, which caused an enormous destruction of buildings and crops.

On the 23rd of July, 1893, a part of the town of Port Louis was entirely destroyed by fire.

On the 22nd February, 1894, during a violent cyclone, a railway train was blown down a ravine at Pailles Bridge; five persons were killed and great loss of material sustained.

General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French nobles. The higher and middle classes possess much intelligence and culture. The natives are proud of their country and of the designation of Creoles.

Nine daily newspapers and other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language is spoken all over the island, English being used in courts of justice. Debates in the council chamber may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhelms, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of 57,367 souls. The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive more than a hundred vessels. It possesses three graving docks. It is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal council.

Water Supply.—A reservoir on the Grande Riviere for the supply of Port Louis Town was constructed some years ago by the municipality. The works begun by the Government in 1885 for supplying pure water from the upland springs to the chief centres of population are complete. The mains extend from the Mare aux Vacoas—with branches—the whole covering a surface of 44 miles. The reservoirs and canals so constructed can supply three and a half millions of gallons per day. These waterworks cost Rs. 430,000. The fever has decreased in the localities now supplied with this upland water. Further works of an important character were commenced during 1892, for the purification of the Mare aux Vacoas water by filtration, and for its extension to the town of Curepipe. The estimated cost, including purchase of lands, was Rs. 909,308. These additional works are now practically completed, and the filtered water is actually delivered.

Scenery.—The famous tale of Paul and Virginia, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an Engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the last century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound, and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

Railways.—There are four lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government: (1) The North line, from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River, south-east. Its length is 31 miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahebourg on the other side; its length is 36 miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet; the gradient in
many places is 1 in 27. (3) The Moka Flacq line, from the Rosehill station on the Midland line to Rivière Sèche station on the North line; length 27 miles. (4) Savanne branch from Rosebelle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 11 miles. The total number of miles of railway now open is 105, the total cost up to date being about 2,665,000L At Curepipe the elevation of the railway is 1,822 feet above the sea. The receipts in 1895 were Rs. 1,751,722, and the expenditure, Rs. 1,172,890.

Religion.—The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the last census, the Roman Catholics numbered 115,436, and the Protestants 7,367. The Roman Catholics received in 1895 Government aid amounting to Rs. 102,520 and the Protestants Rs. 41,038.

Education.—The department of public instruction comprises two branches—the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under the control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent, aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported wholly by the State; the grant schools only partially so. There were in 1895:

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 82 | 9,419 |
| Grant schools | 97 | 8,860 |

Total 179 18,279

Total Number of Pupils.

The relative numbers are shown by the following percentages:
- Members of Church of England . . . 3-23%
- Roman Catholics . . . . . . . . . . 71-31%
- Members of other Christian denominations . . . . . . . . . . 1-40%
- Mahomedans . . . . . . . . . . . . 7-03%
- Hindoos and others . . . . . . . . . . 17-03%

The total expenditure on education in 1895 amounted to Rs. 496,622-61, of which Rs. 300,514-40 were expended on primary education. There are 430 masters and mistresses employed. Of the pupils in the aided schools 73 per cent. are Roman Catholics, 4 per cent. belong to the Church of England, and 1 per cent. to other Christian denominations. No assistance is given to Hindu Schools, but one Assisted Mohammedan School was opened in Plains Williams District during the year 1894.

Military Contribution.—Ordinance No. 26 of 1895 appropriates five per centum of the annual Revenue of Mauritius to the use of the Imperial Government as a military contribution. The total strength of the garrison on 31st Dec., 1895, was 946 men of all ranks. The total military expenditure for the year amounted to 53,857L. The contribution of the colony was 14,906L. A sum of Rs. 32,433-12 has been spent by the Civil Government on defence works in 1895, the two forts and two batteries for the defence of the harbour of Port Louis, are finished and armed.

The total police force on 31st December, 1895, was 665.

Communications.—The mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes leave Marseilles on the 10th and 25th of each month, arriving in Mauritius on the 9th and 19th of the following month respectively. These steamers leave Mauritius on the 14th and 29th of each month, and arrive at Marseilles on the 9th and 30th of the following month respectively. This line receives a subsidy from the Mauritius Government. There is also a four-weekly service with Ceylon by the steamer of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and a four-weekly service with England, via Cape of Good Hope, by the steamers of the same line, length of voyage about 6 weeks. Frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Réunion, &c. Telegraphic communications established along and beyond the railway, the length of line being 135 miles; and communication through a branch office of the East and South African Telegraph Company with Europe via Seychelles, Zanzibar, and Aden, opened in November, 1893. Through rate from Kingdom to Mauritius, 8s. 9d. per word; from Mauritius to United Kingdom, Rs. 7-1-6.

There are in Mauritius, the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 58 branch post offices in the rural districts. Port Louis has a telegraph system, with 86 subscribers. In the island Rodrigues there is one post office at Mathurin. There is no post office on any of the Dependencies. The rates of postage are:

| Letters | New Pence per ½ oz. |
|---------|-------------------|
| United Kingdom, Countries in Postal Union | 18 cents |
| Dependencies | 8 " free |
| Seychelles | 18 " 4½ "

Parcels Post Rates from 1st July, 1895.—In addition to the following charges, the ruling rate of exchange on the day of posting of such parcel is also levied.

| Over 3 lbs. but not over 7 lbs. | 1 88 | 1 50 |
| Over 7 lbs. but not over 11 lbs. | 2 17 | 2 00 |

Commerce.

The island produces hardly anything for its own consumption, but its foreign commerce extends to every quarter of the globe.

The chief exports are sugar, rum, indigo, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, &c. Attention is being turned to the cultivation of tea, with very successful results. Oxen are imported from Madagascar, sheep from South Africa and Australia, and breadstuffs from India.

The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware and manure. There is a small tobacco plantation, but sugar production is the greatest industry. About 90 per cent. of the value of the exports is due to shipments of sugar. In 1895 the weight of sugar exported was 116,454,600 kilos., with an estimated value of Rs. 28,515,058. The value of rum exported was Rs. 290,394; that of vanilla, Rs.
Currency and Banking.

The Mauritius Commercial Bank has established its presence in the colony. The total amount of deposits as at 31st December, 1895, was Rs. 5,044,355.

The Bank of Mauritius (Limited) was established in October, 1894, with paid up capital of Rs. 2,500,000, and opened in Mauritius in Dec., 1894. Total deposits up to end of 1895, Rs. 1,625,262.

A Government savings bank was established in 1876. The total deposits on the 31st December, 1895, amounted to Rs. 3,174,043.

All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents only, the rupee, which is the currency of the island. There are about Rs. 7,869,523.88 (in coin) in circulation. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The circulation on 31st December, 1895, was Rs. 3,070,250.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on 1st May, 1878.

Dependencies.

The numerous dependencies of Mauritius comprise about a hundred islands scattered over the Indian Ocean, and contain a total population of 900 inhabitants. They may be roughly divided into four groups; the Seychelles (see p. 171) the Mauritius Group, the Oil Islands and St. Brandon Group, and detached islands, such as Eagle Island, Banhos, and the Solomon Islands.

The Mauritius Group lie between 4° 24' and 6° 13' S., and 53° 27' and 53° 7' E. long. They are coral islands, producing cocoanut oil and a little rice, and some of them are used as fishing stations. The chief are Poivre, Darros, African, Iles des Roches, Bouleuse, Alphonse, Coq, Cuvier, and Platte. The St. Brandon, or Caribou Islands (Albatross, Tromelin, and Coco), lie between 16° 20' and 16° 50' S. lat., and 59° 26' and 59° 41' E. long. Most of them are mere sandbanks, and their only produce is a little salt fish.

The Chagos Islands, the Trois Freres or Eagle Islands, and the Cosmoledo Islands, which are known generally as the Oil Islands, lie between 9° 40' and 9° 40' S. lat. and 72° 22' and 47° 48' E. long. The chief are North, South, Polyte, Edward, and Menai. Amongst the detached islands may be named Assumption, Astove, St. Pierre, Providence, Cerf, Farquhar, and the Aldabra, but none of these have any permanent population.

Bouriques, the most important dependency of Mauritius after the Seychelles, is situated in latitude S. 19° 41' and longitude E. 63° 23', and are 44 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island is 3 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in executive council. The estimated population on 31st December, 1895, was 2,340.

The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good; sugar-cane, cotton, coffee, rice, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly.

During the time of slavery fortunes were made in this island by agricultural pursuits; but of late years cultivation has been neglected, owing to want of regular communication and insufficient labour. There is an abundance of fresh water springs in the island, and wild guinea fowls and partridges are plentiful. There are also deer and wild pigs. Fruit abounds, such as mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, avocas, custard-apples, wild raspberries, and tamarinds, while the island is famous for oranges, citrons, and limes. The palmiste and vacoa trees are to be found all over the island.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and fruit.

Diego Garcia, the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horse-shoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, fifteen miles by six and a-half, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end and from two to five miles in breadth.

Situated as Diego Garcia is, at 7° latitude S. and between 72° and 73° longitude east, on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin, it affords great convenience for coaling purposes to steamers, and coal depots have been established on the island by commercial companies. In 1885 it was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius, which was, however, withdrawn in 1888.

MAURITIUS: SEYCHELLES.

Mauritius, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1748, and M. Picault, who took possession of the Islands in the name of the king of France, called the principal island Mahé. Later on the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Herault de Soyelles.

The natural resources of the Islands, and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the Colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and retreat, but on the 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcombe, of His Majesty's Ship "Orpheus."

Mr. De Quincy was left in undisturbed possession of his authority, which he had held for twenty years under the French, and subsequently for eighteen years as juge de paix under the British Government.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Capt. Ferrier, of His Majesty's Ship "Albion," and on the capture of Mauritius, Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that Colony.

The increasing importance of these Islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in its constitution, and in December, 1888, an Order in Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council.

An education grant of Rs. 8,000 is annually given in assisting schools of all denominations, of which there were 28 in 1895, attended by 2,178 children. A sum of Rs. 4,000 is also voted for the maintenance of a government undenominational school, and Rs. 1,200 for affiliating two-schools to the Royal College of Mauritius.

Communications, &c.

The steamers of the Messageries Maritimes, leaving Marseilles on the 3rd of each month, call at Mahé on the voyages to and from Australia, a third steamer of the same company completing the circuit of the additional line to Mauritius, Réunion, Madagascar, and Zanzibar. The company have a coaling depot there. The British India Company's steamers between Zanzibar and Bombay and vice-versa also call once a month. Men of war of all nationalities frequently call at Mahé.
The Admiralty have also a coaling station, and passing steamers can procure coal. It has recently been nominated as the head quarters of the Southern Division of the East India Station. Seychelles is a free port in regard to shipping.

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. The rates for telegrams are 2s. per word to Mauritius or Zanzibar, 3s. 6d. to Aden, and 7s. 3d. to London.

Mails leaving England for Seychelles on the 3rd of each month via Marseilles, and leaving Seychelles for Europe on the 15th or 16th, take from 13 to 15 days in transit.

The present letter rate of postage to the United Kingdom and other countries of the Postal Union is 15 cents, and from the United Kingdom to Seychelles, 2½d. The parcels post has been in full operation since April, 1890. During the year 1894, 16,246 letters and 22,085 newspapers, books, and samples, and 524 parcels were received from beyond sea, and 21,068 letters and 1,392 newspapers, and 189 parcels despatched. The money order system is in operation with England and numerous other countries and colonies, and since October, 1893, with Bombay and Aden direct.

Savings Bank.

A Government savings bank was established in March, 1894, and towards the close of the year Rs. 16,914 was upon deposit.

Revenue, Trade, Products, &c.

The revenue is derived principally from specific import duties, which are light and an ad valorem duty of 9½ per cent. on articles not otherwise enumerated, licenses, a locally assessed property or income tax and stamps. There is no export duty.

The chief exports consist of cocoa nut oil, cocoa, vanilla, turtle shell, cloves, cocoa nuts, soap, vacoa bags, &c.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated cocos-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made by the natives.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelles administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are however to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands.

The lighthouse is situated on Denis Island, and the quarantine station is placed on Long Island opposite to Mahé.

Natal.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from the discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497, on the south-east coast of Africa, about 300 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between the 29th and 31st parallels of S. lat.: it is bounded by the Tugela and Umtamvuna Rivers, and the Drakensberg Mountains. It comprises an area of about 20,851 square miles (being over twice the size of England and Wales), and has a sea-coast of one hundred and seventy miles. It is a watered country, no less than 23 distinct streams running into the Indian Ocean in the one hundred and seventy miles of coast. Unfortunately, none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of 20,155; the largest and only port is Durban, with 27,984 inhabitants, of whom half are Natives and Indians.

History.

The discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, but little is to be found respecting it until when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, and abandoned it.

Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on his voyage, endeavoured to colonize it, but a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused all nations under his own despotic sway, the tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, prevented the formation of a settlement by this band of white men, which, however, was up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Boers from the Cape Colony, taking advantage of restrictions placed on them by the Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were cruelly murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother.

For two years the Zulus and the Boers were at war with various success; but in 1839 the Boers obtained a decisive victory, and placed an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

There was formerly another British settlement named Port Natal, a factory of the East India Company on the west side of Sumatra, founded 1751, and not finally abandoned until the cession of Sumatra to the Dutch in 1824.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

Constitution.

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (the Constitution Act, of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first ministry was appointed.

The ministers are: the Colonial Secretary, who is also Prime Minister and Minister of Education, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and the Minister of Lands and Works, all of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of eleven Members, is, in the case of the first council, summoned by the Governor, and thereafter from time to time by the Governor in Council. The Members are summoned from the following districts of the Colony:—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umtata, and three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; but not more than two Members may be chosen from within any one county.

Each Member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the Members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immovable property within the Colony of the value of £500 in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 37 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors chosen by the electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 13 in the Colony.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of
the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve
the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election,
the qualifications of electors, and to all other
matters concerning elections, in force at the
time of the passing of the Act, apply to the
election of Members to serve in the Legislative
Assembly.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Act
includes £1,900 for pensions to officers retired on
account of the change in the Constitution, and
also £8,200 for the salaries of the Governor and
Ministers, £600 for an Under Secretary for Native
Affairs, and £10,000 for the promotion of the
welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more
than two miles from the Seat of Government receive
12 per day travelling allowance. The session is
usually from April to June.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property
to the value of 50l., or is in receipt of rents from
property of an annual value of 10l., or who has
been a resident in the Colony, and whose income,
inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month,
is entitled to a vote.

Local Government.

There are municipal corporations in Durban,
Maritzburg, and Newcastle, and local boards in
Ladysmith and Verulam. Their total revenue in
1894-95 was 237,458l., their expenditure 229,333l.,
and their debt 680,705l.

Native Affairs.

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amalubi
Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Dra-
kensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into
Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colo-
nial war was dispatched against the tribe, and
Langalibalele and many of the tribe were se-
cured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele,
his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were
brought to trial under "native law." About 290
prisoners were condemned to various terms of
imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was con-
demned to banishment or transportation for life,
and one of his sons to a similar punishment for
five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were
confiscated. Langalibalele and his son were trans-
ported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were
allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been
governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance
No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the
authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed
them under the personal authority of the Governor as
Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the
measure of justice among them in civil and criminal
matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to
the ordinary law courts in cases of crimes mala in se.

The native population was deprived of the fran-
chise, but by an Act No. 28 of 1865, machinery was
provided by which a native might procure his relief
from the operation of native law, in which case
he was entitled to all the rights of an ordinary
colonist.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the
tribal organisation, and the judicial and other
authority of the Chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875)
established a Native High Court to administer civil
justice to the natives, and placed them under the
ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as re-
gards political crimes, crimes arising out of native
customs, and crimes declared triable under
local law by native law, all which crimes
were reserved for the Native High Court. By
No. 13, 1895 the Native High Court and the
established by law No. 10, 1876, were abol-
ished and the jurisdiction of these Courts transferred
to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain
cases to the Magistrates' Courts. A white magis-
trate was placed with every tribe, who is the adminis-
trator of justice in civil matters, and supersedes to a
considerable extent the authority of the Chiefs.
Tribes live apart, upon locations provided for
by the Government. But besides these loca-
tions there are many native squatters on
lands, and many living by regular late-
rals. By law No. 13 of 1875 a tax on
native marriages was abolished, while at the
same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s.
Under law 41, 1884, a rent of 14 per cent
was imposed upon natives living on Crown
land.

The area vested in the Native Trust
occupation by natives, is 2,200,000 acres,
or about 150,000 acres held by religious mis-
sionaries. The number of natives living on these lands
is estimated in 1885 at 169,800, there being at
the same date about 162,600 on private lands and
42,000 on Crown lands as squatters.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies, but is usually mild, cool,
bright. On the coast it is semi-tropical. The
mean temperature at Pietermaritzburg is 63° F.,
at Durban 69°. The rainfall at the coast is
about 40 inches, and less inland. The rainy season
is from October to March inclusive, during which
thunderstorms are frequent and severe.

More than four-fifths of the inhabitants are
Kaffirs, and about 7 per cent. are Indian. The
Europeans nearly all speak English, but some of
them are of Dutch descent, with some Germans
and Norwegians.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with England
(voyage from England to Natal, 24 days; and
from Natal to England daily 24 days), and
services with Cape daily: with Mauritius and
Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chileoane, Beira, Mo-
bique, Ibo, &c.) once or twice a month; with
Delagow Bay six times a month or more frequently
with Australia fortnightly; and at intervals of
twelve days with India.

There is direct land telegraph communica-
tion with the South African Republic, the Orange
State, the Cape, Zululand, Rhodesia, Delagoa
Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by
way of Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the
world generally.

There are 790½ miles of Government tele-
graph constructed at a cost of 95,906l. 18s. 8½d.,
earnings for the year ended 30th June, 1896, were
30,054l. 0s. 2d. (cash receipts, 23,326l.; loss
of value of Government messages, 6,727l.; and
the expenses, 18,249l. 17s. 9½d.).

There are 402½ miles of railway op-
erated and worked by the Government, with
the exception of the Dundee branch (2½ miles).
which was constructed by the Dundee Coal Company, but is worked by the Government, and will ultimately be absorbed into the Natal Government railway system.

The main line extends from the Port of Durban (Pietermaritzburg) to Charlestown, the border of the South African Republic (194 miles distant from the port), where it connects with the Netherlands South African Company's line to Johannesburg and Pretoria. A branch line extends northwards from Durban to Pietermaritzburg, 194 miles, and another from South Junction to Isipingo, 62 miles. The work begun in January, 1876, and the sections authorised were completed in November, 1877. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 35 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the line which completes the main line to Charlestown, on the border of the South African Republic, opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was made at the close of 1895. A branch to Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State, from the line at the 100 mile post, was opened for goods on 14th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59½ miles, all of which run through the Orange Free State.

The total cost of construction of the railways to the end of June, 1896, was £6,117,211. Receipts for the six months ended 30th June, 1896, were £482,949, and the expenditure £190,158. Net receipts were equal to 9¾ l. 11s. 5½ d. per cent. of the capital expended upon open lines.

Defence.

There is a garrison of about 1,500 Imperial troops quartered at Pietermaritzburg.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of 1895, consisted of 1,346 of all ranks. This includes a volunteer naval force of 77 men.

There is also an armed and mounted police force, comprising 269 Europeans. The port of Durban is strongly fortified by a battery on the Bluff and at the Back Beach armed with heavy guns.

Industry.

The chief exports are wool, sugar, tea hides, cattle, coal, maize, hair, wattle bark, and ostrich feathers.

There is a large transit trade with the Orange Free State, and the South African Republic. The harbour of Durban, which has a somewhat dangerous bar, has been much improved by the works of the Harbour Department, and by dredging. It is a port of registry, having, in 1895, vessels, with a total tonnage of 5,444 tons.

The main industry of the Colony is, however, agriculture; large numbers of cattle and sheep are reared, and large crops of maize and sugar are produced. There are several mines of coal, those at Ladysmith, Eland's Laagte, and Newcastle supply the Government railways.

The area under sugar is about 14,506 acres, producing for the year ended 30th June, 1895, 29,401 tons; that under coffee about 490 acres, yielding 38,850 lbs. Tea, tobacco, arrowroot, and cayenne pepper are also grown. The area under tea in 1895 was 2,207 acres, yielding 1,000 lbs., and the area cultivated by natives was 1,000 acres.

The stock owned by Europeans was as follows: horses, 27,758; mules, 1,227; cattle (horned), 512; sheep, 950,187; Angora goats, 60,582; pigs, 17,458; donkeys, 539. The stock owned by natives was as follows: Horses, 30,871; cattle (horned), 508,938; sheep, 19,282; goats, 285,517; pigs, 43,686.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, the Bank of Africa, and the African Banking Corporation have together sixteen establishments, with 1,935,203l. deposits. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1895 (Dec. 31st), 172,304l. deposits.

Education.

There are 22 Government schools, 60 aided denominational and other schools, and 227 farm-house schools. The aggregate number of pupils in regular attendance at the Government and inspected schools was 7,608 (1895). The management is vested in the Minister of Education, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. There are also 133 native schools receiving Government aid, with an attendance of 6,790, and 28 Indian schools, all of which are aided, with an attendance of 2,919. Total children on rolls, 17,317.
