THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West Indies, form the most northerly group of Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included among the Windward Islands as the term was used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin). The English Leeward Islands (except Sombrero, see page 289), comprising the Presidencies of Antigua, with its dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda, Montserrat, Kitts, and Nevis, including Anguilla, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a

Leeeward Islands.

The Leeward Islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically.

They were all colonised from St. Kitts as a whole, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in several islands, notably one "to provide against the want of fines and common recoveries," which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as being anticipated by nearly a century and a half a beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 and 4 Will. IV, c. 74.

A General Legislature met for the last time in 1783 when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of sugar at ten per cent. for the benefit of the English exporter—both which were disallowed. An attempt made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the Act was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, the Legislature never actually met, yet the Act to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was due to the energy and activity of Sir John Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into a Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually mild and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 36 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat have annual rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but little range. The Virgin Islands are cooler, but are subject to hurricanes. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from June to December.

Constitution.

By the "Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) colonies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 15 of 1882, the Legislative Council now consists of ten elective and ten non-elective members. Four elective members are chosen by the elective members of the Island Council of Antigua, by those of the Legislative Assembly of Dominica, and four by the non-official members of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The non-elective members appointed by the Queen are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Administrator of St. Kitts and Nevis, with five unofficial members, one from each of the island councils, and another member of one of them who acts as President.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, procedure in maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets once a year, at a place notified by proclamation (usually at St. John, Antigua), and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts from two to four weeks.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies, Antigua bearing five-sixteenths, Dominica three-sixteenths, Montserrat one-sixteenth, St. Kitts and Nevis three-eighths, and the Virgin Islands one-sixteenth.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the Queen's pleasure, and the Queen has power at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from both Councils.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. In addition to these, the gold doubloons are legal tender. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£3,500), and St. Kitts (£14,000), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender. Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies except the Virgin Islands.

Means of Communication.

Mail communication exists between England and the Southern Islands, including Trinidad, and with the Northern Islands and Jamaica, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the same islands, as...
far as Trinidad, and to the United States of America, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line. The Royal Mail Company also runs a steamer on regular days in each week, connecting the various islands of the group, under a contract with the Colonial Government. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. The usual time occupied by the voyage from England to Antigua is about 14 days.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia and Martinique, and two St. Kitts with Antigua and St. Thomas; Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable station to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

Postage.

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union (to England 2½d. per ½ oz.). Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, the rates being 1d. the ½ oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 10,000; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 7,000; and Roseau (Dominica), 4,500.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

In Antigua there is a Yeomanry Cavalry Corps consisting of 35 officers and men, and small Artillery Corps. In St. Kitts there was until 1888 a Horse Artillery Corps, and two troops of Cavalry, the strength of the former being 26 men, and of the latter 56, officers included.

There are numerous old forts, mostly dismantled and in ruins, situated round the coasts of the several islands.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans, and Roman Catholics. The schools established by these denominations receive grants in aid from the local revenues of each Presidency. School fees are charged, and the schools are required to reject all children applying for admission. Grants are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. There are about 125 aided schools, attended by 20,879 children. Grants of varying amounts are also made to grammar schools established on the islands except the Virgin Islands. Provision is also being made for technical education.

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 580), and Redonda (population 120) are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles, very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was once owned by the Codrington family. It produces salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing, exporting cattle to Antigua. It is one of the few islands where wild deer are still found. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N. lat., 61° 35' W. long., 1 mile by ¼ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered 1865, now worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license at 6d. per ton royalty. On an average 7,000 tons are annually exported to the United States, 90 men being employed.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663, Charles II made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs on the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. The island is in the main low lying and has no forests, and is liable to hurricanes, which occur principally in the month of August. The rainfall for 1894 was 48-00 inches.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, and Treasurer, are ex officio members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1845, and are as follows:

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of 111l., or one acre of land and building value 222l., or tenancy paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 316 voters registered for the whole island, 165 are registered for the City of St. John.

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years.

The chief productions are sugar and pine-apples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruined in the hands of the old planting families. There are 87 estates in cultivation, comprising 17,900 acres. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 10,000, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1894, 49 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 1,325. The other towns are Falmouth and Parham.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

The Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis, and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882. The total population is 43,963 by the census of 1891, and the total area about 153 square miles, about the size of Rutland.

Constitution.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator appointed by him, presides, and the Administrator also pays an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor or Administrator sees fit.

Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, molasses, and rum. Arrowroot, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco are also grown in small quantities. Cattle are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla. The sugar crop of 1884 amounted to 13,095 tons for St. Kitts and Nevis, and the export of rum was 61,530 gallons, and of molasses 4,915 hogsheads.

In 1891 a volunteer force was raised, consisting of Mounted Infantry, 55; Infantry, 57; total 112. This force is increasing in strength.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles, and the total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 1,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital. Basseterre, population about 10,000, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1894, 54 sailing vessels of 1,183 tons.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The temperature is from 78° to 85°.

The rainfall for the year 1894 was 42.45 inches.

Total area under various crops:

| Crop          | Area   |
|---------------|--------|
| St. Kitts, cane crops | 15,426 acres |
| Nevis         | 5,483 " |

St. Kitts, the native name of which was Liamuiga, or "the fertile island," was the first settled of the Leeward group. Thomas Warner was despatched thither in 1623 by Mr. Ralph Mervynfield, but a hurricane destroyed the first results of his efforts at cultivation, and it was only in 1625, when he had obtained the patronage and assistance of the Earl of Carlisle, and a commission as King's Lieutenant over St. Kitts, alias Morwar's Hope, Nevis, Barbados, and Montserrat, that a permanent lodgment was effected. On the very day that Warner landed, Desnambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and in the face of the common enemy, the Caribs, the two colonies settled peacefully side by side, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence all the other islands in the group were colonized, and the settlement grew fast. In 1629 they were almost destroyed by the Spaniards, but soon recovered. The war with France and Holland, in the early part of the reign of Charles II, led to a struggle between the colonists of the rival nations, ending in a victory for the French, the English settlers capitulating in 1666. The English part of the island was restored at the peace of Breda, 1667. The same thing happened during the war of the Spanish Succession, and it was not till the Treaty of Utrecht that the island in its entirety passed into the hands of Great Britain. With all the other Leeward Islands it was captured by the French in the beginning of the wars of the French Revolution, but was re-captured after Rodney's victory in 1783.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry,
having on 31st December, 1894, one vessel registered, with a tonnage of 136.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands—the distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

The united Presidency now maintains steam communication twice daily, at a present cost of $5,000 per annum.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at £500, and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,300, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, licences, &c.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 29' N. lat., and 61° 13' and 61° 30' W. long; is miles long and 16 broad; very mountainous; picturesque; was discovered by Christopher Columbus, on Sunday (hence its name) 3rd November, 1493, on his second voyage; lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, and has an area of 280 square miles.

This island was included in the grant of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to Sir Robert Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1670; several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be in possession. During the time that Dominica thus professedly regarded by the English as the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English, and by the ninth article of the peace of 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which came to the British Crown the sum of £12,000 sterling. The French settlers were generally secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small rent. Dominica at this time formed one of the British Government, comprising also Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771 the island was constituted a separate Government.

In 1771, the French, attracted by the beauty of the place, and invited over from Martinique some of their countrymen, prepared a naval and naval armament against the island, but the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, became masters of the island on the 7th September, after an obstinate resistance. Mr. Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor; trade failed and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1805, now the most remarkable event in the island for marking the time of its occupation and which goes by the name of La Gras (name of the invading General), the French landed at each flank of Roseau. The French troops and the militia fought gallantly, but fortunately Roseau, the capital, was set fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate to the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the French, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular militia) proceeded across the island to the position of Prince Ruperts.

Serious riots occurred in 1893 in connection with the collection of taxes in the interior of the island. The police and marines were stoned, and ordered to fire on the rioters, with fatal results.

An inquiry into the administration was made by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who left for Dominica in November, 1893, and returned to England in December of the same year.

It is estimated that about 150,000 acres of the island are at present uncultivated. Much
at one time under coffee, but "blight" and marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of land has still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil and climate are adapted for the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, tea, nutmegs, spices, and tropical fruits of all kinds.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is mic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a lesser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet. An eruption in the great crater took place on January, 1880, ash and scoria covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The south-east of the island are deposits of iron ore now being mined successfully.

Sugar, cocoa, and lime-juice are the chief products, but some fruit, coffee, spice, oils, and timber are also exported from the island. The principal exports in 1894 were: Coffee, 5,409 lbs., value £62,718; sugar, 1,220 hogsheads; lime-juice, value £10,964. The island abounds in rivers and rivulets, well stocked with fish. The average rainfall for 1894 was 87 inches.

The chief town is Roseau, population about 1,500; it is a port of registry, and had registered 1st December, 1894, five vessels, of a total tonnage of 54.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of members. In 1865 the Legislative Assembly was reduced, by an Act of the Local Legislature, from 9 nominated and 19 elected members to 7 nominated and 7 elected members. The Governor presides over the deliberations of the House and exercises a casting vote in the House, a deliberative as well as a casting vote in Committee.

Persons for a parish must possess land or houses assessed at £4 per annum, or be an occupier of land worth £1 per annum, or have an income of £5, or pay taxes of £5 per annum.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois.

MONTserrat.

This island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, named by him after a famous mountain where is situated the monastery in which Loyola conceived the project of founding Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in latitude, and 61° W. long., and is about 11l. length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its area is 324 square miles. It is of volcanic origin and very rugged and mountainous. The island is covered with forest, the highest elevation being Soufriere Hill (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. The cultivated land is mainly on the western and south-eastern sides. The chief town, with a population of 1,500, is open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December last 2 sailing vessels, 1 steam vessel, total tonnage 64 tons.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782 but was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council Assembly as early as 1668. After various modifications they became more powerful. A Legislative Assembly, which lasted down to 1867.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council, 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly a Legislative Council was established, with the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. Her Majesty may at any time appoint such persons, not exceeding six in all, as she may think fit, to be members of said Council, every councillor holding office by Her Majesty's pleasure.

The principal export of the island is sugar, which is shipped in tierces and barrels; 5 tons equalling 2 hogsheads. In a very good year the exports are 2,500 hogsheads. In 1882 the exports were 2,500 hogsheads, value 20,559l. The average price for the same year was valued at 8s. Many sugar works are furnished with steam engines, but there are still some few places which rely on the windmill; there are also a few mills, and two or three mills are worked by power.

Within the last twenty years there has been established a valuable staple export, viz., lime-juice concentrated. There are (principally in the northern part of the island) about 1,000 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation...
It is principally in the hands of the Montserrat Company, Limited.

There are seven Anglican schools with 1,468 pupils, three Wesleyan with 672, one Roman Catholic with 113, and two undenominational with 159 pupils—in all 2,764 children at school.

The roads of the island have of late years been improved, macadamized, and drained by means of culverts and surface drains; and every effort is made in these respects, as far as the full revenue of the island will permit.

Montserrat is considered to be the most healthy place in the West Indies.

The rainfall in 1893, was 70 inches, and the temperature is about 81°.

**VIRGIN ISLANDS**

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to westward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British Islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dyke, Peter's Island, Salt Island, and all others not now actually in possession of Denmark with the exception of Bienes, or Crab Island, and Culbra, which are Spanish. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. Sombrero is British, but is not included in the Colony.

The Danes possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government, and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government, who is to preside at the meetings of the Council, and to have a casting vote as well as a deliberation vote.

There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Roadtown, Tortola, population 400, which is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1890, 19 vessels, of a total tonnage of 841.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and during the American Civil War the landed proprietors planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly. The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise a few cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest...
seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Danish Islands, and to a smaller extent with Hayti and San Domingo. The currency consists almost entirely of Mexican dollars, and Danish silver and copper, which are not legal tender. There is also a curious local currency of old Spanish dollars roughly cut into halves, quarters, and eighths, stamped with the word "Tortola." A small number of French copper coins of Louis XVI are also current under the name of "Dogs," value three farthings each.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property.

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great.

The mail communication is by small sailing craft to St. Thomas, which is touched at fortnightly by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's steamers. The Leeward Islands contract steamer, "Tyne," also calls every fortnight.

### Malta

#### Situation and Area

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of mainland of Africa. Valletta, the port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The area of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is about 36 square miles; that of Gozo about 20 square miles, and that of Comino about 1 square mile. Filtha and Cominotto are but islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

#### History

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino, mention is made at very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1200. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as the most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Greeks, and then of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese islands fell successively to the lot of the Carthaginians, then to the Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of Paul took place (Acts xxviii). On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell into the hands of the Goths, and then into those of the Saracens, who were expelled in 1090 by Godfrey of Lorraine.
Climate.

The climate of Malta is equable and very mild in winter. In August the heat at the sea approaches that experienced in the tropics; but, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind. The mean temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 61° F., and the minimum 53° F.; but during the four warmest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is 82° Fahr., and the minimum 67°, and the annual rainfall varies from 10 to 20 inches. There is no rivulet in the island, the water drainage being absorbed in the porous sandstone beds, flowing its way through underground channels.

Industry.

The island is highly cultivated; its principal crops are cotton, potatoes, and corn; the vine is abundant; honey of a superior kind is also produced; and early crops of potatoes and onions are exported to England. Many cattle, sheep, and goats are reared. But a large number of inhabitants are employed in connection with the numerous trade of Valletta as a coaling station and port of call. It is a port of entry, having on 31st December, 1895—124 vessels of together 9,365 tons. There is a large trade with Tunis, Tripoli, Algeria, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

Chief Towns.

Valletta, the capital and chief town, has a population, according to the census, 1891, 22,255, including garrison and Royal Navy. The suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's have a population of 37,909 in 1891. The "three cities" on the other side of the harbour from Valletta (Cospicua, Vittoriosa, and Senglea) have a population of 26,537. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is situated in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, has a population of 8,008 in 1891. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), population 1,124.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants of the country districts resemble southern Italians in appearance, and in some respects show distinct traces of their Punic descent. The towns and among the upper classes are to be found representatives of families who have settled in Malta from many different countries. The Maltese language, which is generally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is held to be derived from the Carthaginian and Arabic tongues. The educated and commercial classes usually speak also Italian or English, or both. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, hard-working, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found as traders in Tunis, Egypt, and around the Mediterranean coast.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banco di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The first two banks have a small note circulation, reported to amount to about 30,000l., and the deposits in the three banks are estimated at about 200,000l. The Government savings bank, established in 1883, had on 31st December, 1895, 473,042l. deposits.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway 7½ miles in length and 3 feet 3 in. gauge, now belonging to the Malta Government, which was originally built by the Malta Railway Company at the cost of about 90,000l., and there are 65 miles of telegraph, constructed and worked by the military authorities, but open to public use. Valetta has an extensive telephone system, and is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables to Gibraltar, Bone (Algeria), Sicily (2), Alexandria (2), and Zante.

It is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is a most important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling in quarantine, and at any hour, day and night, and for ensuring the delivery of full weight of bunker coals when owners call for a Custom House certificate of weight. There is direct mail communication with nearly every Mediterranean port, several times per week, and with England, Sicily, or Reggio or Brindisi, daily, except on Sundays. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Internal | ¼ oz.     |
| Europe, Tunis, the Levant, the United States, and all Postal Union Countries | ¼d. Free |

The total correspondence despatched in 1895 was: Letters 917,002; postcards, 63,118; newspapers, 346,417. Internal correspondence received and despatched: Letters, 218,579; newspapers, 57,690.

Public Works.

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and has greatly improved their sanitary condition. The reorganization of the water supply, hitherto very defective, has also been taken in hand, and considerable water works have been established for raising and distributing at high pressure an effective supply of pure water for all purposes. These works have now been extended to all the large villages and to Gozo. In connection with this work arrangements are contemplated for an extension of the means of irrigation, and for
utilizing drainage. Considerable progress has also been made lately in improving the roads and streets and in public lighting. Electric lighting is being installed in Valletta, Floriana and the Three Cities, including the Great Harbour and Marsamuscetto Harbour. The harbour accommodation has been greatly improved, a loan of 20,000l. having been made from Imperial funds in 1873 to the Anglo-Maltese Hydraulic Dock Company, under the Colonial Docks Act.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, and reconstituted in 1887; it consists of ten members besides the President and the clerk. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly elective council of government originally constituted by letters patent of 11th May, 1849, and re-constituted by letters patent of 12th Dec., 1887. It now consists of six official members and fourteen elected, four of whom are returned by special electors, and chosen from the classes of ecclesiastics, nobles, university graduates, and members of the chamber of commerce respectively. Public officers are ineligible for election, and not more than two ecclesiastics may be chosen by the general electors. The islands are divided into ten electoral districts, returning one member each. The total number of electors is over 10,000. The qualification for a member of Council is the possession of immovable property of the clear value of 100l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immovable property to the annual value of 10l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40l. a year for board and lodging, for the same period previous to election. The qualification for a general elector is an income from immovable property of 6l. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6l. per annum for six calendar months before registration, or, independently of both, the age of twenty-one years, and qualification to serve as a common juror. That of a special elector, and of the members elected by this class, is an income from immovable property of 60l., or payment of rent of that amount. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts three years. The Governor is ex officio President, with the power of veto. A Vice-President was appointed by Letters Patent dated 6th February, 1893. The Governor, or the Vice-President, if present, may depute an official member to preside. There are no municipalities or other forms of local government.

Education and Religion.

Primary education is carried on almost exclusively in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 175 scholars, and 113 primary and infants' schools with 13,385 pupils. There is a public lyceum with 529 scholars, and a university (founded in 1769) with 113 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are extremely low, being respectively 1s. and 2s. 6d. per family per month. There are numerous private secondary schools. The total number of these schools is 128, with 3,814 scholars. Education is not compulsory. The Roman Catholic religion is almost universal amongst the Maltese.

Defence.

Malta is the principal naval station in Mediterranean, and is strongly fortified. It is defended by massive and extensive works, the garrison of over 10,262 N.C.O. and men includes 383 R.M.A., 1,076 R.M. Militia, and Malta Militia Division, Royal Engineers. The Island Government contributes 5,000l. for its contribution.

Revenue.

There is no direct taxation of any kind. The most important sources of revenue are Customs duties, port dues, and land revenue.

Weights and Measures.

Malta barrel is equal to 9½ imperial gallons.
,, salm ,, 1 quarter.
,, cantar ,, 175 lbs. English.
,, caffiso ,, 4½ imperial gallons.
