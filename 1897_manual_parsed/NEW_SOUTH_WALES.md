NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.
The Colony of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 153rd meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger, its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at its south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the Colony of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the Colony follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three Colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the Colony is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the Colony follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian.
NEW SOUTH WALES.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade in 1895 was 37°5, to Bourke and Moree, where it was 69°5 and 69°8 respectively. On the coast it varied from 60°6 at Eden to 63°8 at Moree, Sydney being 63°1, almost the same as Barcelona. On the mountains snow lies in places all the winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 57°8, and on the inland plains about 62°.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1895 at Sydney was 31°86 inches; and the days on which rain fell 171. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while Sydney in 171 days has 31°86 inches. Fifty years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The export of wool the produce of the Colony during the past ten years has been as follows:

Altogether Britain and British Possessions absorb 89-75 per cent. of import, and 78-97 per cent. of export trade.

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 433,889 tons, valued at 236,230l., while in 1881, 1,775,224 tons, valued at 603,248l., were raised from 40 mines; and in 1895, 8,788,589 tons, valued at 1,095,327l., were raised from 39 mines.
Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry. 26 vessels, of a total tonnage of 6,535 tons, were registered during the year 1895, while the total number of vessels on the registers at the close of 1895 was 964, with a tonnage of 112,042.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was received for coinage during 1895 to the extent of £2,768,447.

Total average amount of deposits in banks of issue for December quarter, 1895:

| Deposits bearing interest | £20,106,821 |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Deposits not bearing interest | 10,222,436 |
| **Total** | **£30,629,257** |

The average note circulation for the same period was £223,864.

The New South Wales Savings Bank, established in 1832, had, at the close of 1895, 71,099 depositors, with £3,951,875 deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 4½ per cent. per annum on deposits up to £200; on accounts remaining open at end of year, on accounts closed during the year the rate is 3½ per cent. per annum. When deposits made by any one individual exceed the sum of £200, no interest is allowed on such excess, but this regulation does not apply to the deposits of Penny Savings Banks, Charitable Institutions, and Friendly Societies. The Government (Post Office) Savings Banks, established in 1871, had, on 31st December, 1895, 4,121,700 depositors. Interest is allowed at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on all deposits up to £200.

Means of Communication.

There are 36,071 miles of Government roads, 6,513 of which are metalled and gravelled or ballasted. In addition there are 27,663 culverts (under 15 feet span), 409,990 feet, 3,659 bridges (over 15 feet) = 264,315 feet, and 12,383 causeways = 296,812 feet. There are also 268 punts, 65 flood boats, and 1 horse boat belonging to the department. There are 2,531 miles of railways, all owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been £6,852,194. The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1896, were £2,820,417, and the working expenses £1,551,888, the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being £1,268,529. There are also 84 miles of private railway, which cost £33,642, to construct. There are 61 miles of Government tramways, earning £289,184, against working expenses amounting to £236,283. The total capital expenditure on tramways, £1,434,896.

Of telegraphy there are 12,316 miles open, with 28,799 miles of wire, with 834 stations. The cost of construction was £40,380, and the rent received during 1895, £45,901.

The following are the numbers of telegrams transmitted and received in New South Wales:

Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, the Hunter, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens, Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamer leave Sydney regularly for most parts of the world, but the direct connection with Europe is chiefly by the vessels P. and O. (via Colombo and Port Said), Orient lines (via Colombo and Naples), those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Malta and Marseilles), Union Company (via San Francisco), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), North German Lloyd (via Colombo and Sald). Seven mails per month are sent and received from England.

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants and paid by fixed salaries. The school fees per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

In 1895, there were 2,563 State schools divided into 2,771 departments in operation, namely 1,681 schools, 2 for boys and 3 for girls.
Infantry—5th Regiment (Scottish) Honorary, 171; Chaplains, 12; Medical Officers Affiliated, 14; Strength of Rifle Clubs, 1,800. Total 6,819.

The Naval Forces are: a Naval Brigade, numbering 335, and 201 Naval Artillery Volunteers, both sections partially paid. The Naval Defence Force Staff, and the two Torpedo Boats, number 8 men. There is a total force (military and naval) of 7,363 of all ranks.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 12 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 182 boroughs and municipal districts, controlling property of the annual value of £7,895,645, and having a revenue in 1894-95 of £754,239, exclusive of loans, an expenditure of £1,032,667, and an outstanding debt of £2,583,874; but against this are accumulated sinking funds of £197,471.

The chief towns and their population will be found at p. 188.

Constitution.

The first legislative council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 66 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict., No. 13), consisted of 141 members, representing 74 electoral districts; and provision was made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise was given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in District.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of £100, or of the annual value of £10, respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of £10, or who shall hold, and for the said 6 months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

A new Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1899, provides for the division of the Colony into...
125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The present Parliament, therefore, numbers 16 less than the last. The new Act also abolishes the property qualification and plural voting, and establishes the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalized subject, and who shall have resided in the Colony for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day. The first election under this Act took place on July 17th, 1894; and the second on July 24th, 1895.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Acts of 1858 and 1880, now repealed.

The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Under a law passed in 1889, members receive 300l. per annum each.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long.), and is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tuamotu), which is under French protection. It was discovered by Cartaret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1780, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1893 to 120.

NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of a small group of islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 48' E. long., the other islets being Philip, Nepean, and Bird Isles. They comprise altogether about 12 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Capt. Cook. It remained uninhabited until 1788, when a settlement was formed there from Botany Bay. This was removed in 1855, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 150 persons settling there, with cattle, sheep, and pigs. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of S.P.G., and the total population on 31st December, 1887, was 741. At the census of 1891 it was 760. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the fishery.

There was formerly but little regular administration, the community being presided over by one of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrate, with a simple code of laws. The island has since been placed under the government of New South Wales, and a resident magistrate has been appointed. Communication with the group is maintained by a sailing vessel once in every six months. There is a resident doctor, and an efficient school. The chief village is Kingston, the largest island.

Resident Magistrate, Col. Z. Spalding, C.M.G.

LORD HOWE ISLAND.

Lord Howe Island is a dependency of New South Wales, about six miles long, and one mile broad. Its population in 1893 was 63 persons. It is a mountainous, well-wooded island. The soil in some places is very rich, and remarkable for its equable and delightful climate. It is situated about 450 miles E. of Sydney, in 31° 30' S. lat. and 159° 25' E. long., and forms part of the Colony, being administered by a visiting magistrate from Sydney.

The islet of Ball's Pyramid lies between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands.
