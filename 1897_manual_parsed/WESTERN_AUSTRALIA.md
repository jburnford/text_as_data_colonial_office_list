WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises nearly one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 975,920 square miles (equal to half European Russia, or to over one-fourth of Europe). The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

Physical Features.

The coast line, extending for a distance of about 8,000 miles, is indented by a certain number of bays, creeks, and harbours, and in the northern parts fringed by numerous islands. In the south there are three separate mountain chains running parallel to one another. The loftiest range in the Southern District is the Stirling Range, the highest point of which is about 3,500 feet. The principal other ranges are known as the Blackwood, Darling, and Roe; these, with the exception of Mount William, in the Murray District, 3,000 feet high, do not reach greater altitudes than from 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the level of the sea. In the Kimberley District the two principal ranges of hills are the Leopold and the Muller ranges, the highest point in the latter attaining about 2,300 feet. The settled districts are usually level undulating, rarely mountainous. The western seaboard is comparatively flat, of a sandy character, with indications of a recent geological formation. To the eastward of the Darling range, in the latitude of Perth, the country changes its character and improves for some distance inland. The east and north-eastern parts of the Colony contain a large area of good pastoral country, suitable in some parts for the growth of tropical produce such as sugar and coffee.

The Darling hills extend from Yatheroo in the north, to Point d'Entrecasteaux in the south, a distance of about 300 miles.

Numerous small rivers and streams take their rise in this range, and flow into the sea to the westward.

The principal rivers of the Colony are the Prince Regent, Panton, Fitzroy, De Grey, Harcourt, Fortescue, Ashburton, Lyons, Gascoyne, Murchison, Greenough, Irwin, Swan, Murray, Collie, Preston, Blackwood, Warren, Palmerup, and Gordon. Most of these are mere storm-water channels filled only during the rainy season, but very few of them are navigable even for boats for any distance.

Lakes and Islands.

The lake district may be considered to be confined to the westward of the Darling range. Within this area there are numerous salt and brackish water lakes and lagoons—but many of them are nothing more than swamps during the dry season.

Numerous islands and islets occur along the coast-line. Dirk Hartog Island, in Shark Bay, is the largest of those used for pastoral purposes, whilst guano is found on the islands comprising Houtman's Abrolhos, the Lacepedes, and several other islands on the north-west coast.

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George Sound to form a settlement. In 1827 Captain Gilbert, R.N., in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and in 1828 Captain Fremantle (afterwards Sir Clas. Fremantle, G.C.B.), in H.M.S. "Success," took possession of the territory. In 1829, Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle (the latter named after Captain Fremantle mentioned above) was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the first settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupation were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1830, the Colony was in a distressing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned that it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886.

Constitution and Government.

Previous to 1880 the constitution was what is called "Representative," established by Act of Victoria, No. 13. The Governor was assisted by
executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and the Governor also had power to appoint two unofficial members to the executive Council. There was also a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members.

Responsible government was granted to Western Australia in October, 1890, and the first Ministry sworn in on 29th December, 1890.

The legislature consists of two houses: the Legislative Council, consisting of 21 members, and the Legislative Assembly, of 33 members. Both Houses are elective.

Legislative Council.—The Colony is divided into electoral provinces, each returning 3 members.

Tenure of Seat.—6 years.

Qualification of Member.—Must be (1) 30 years of age, and free from any legal incapacity; (2) a resident in the Colony for at least 2 years; (3) a natural-born subject of Her Majesty or naturalized for 5 years, and a resident in the Colony during the period.

Qualification of Elector.—(1) Each elector must be at least 21 years of age, and not subject to any legal incapacity; (2) a natural-born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, resident in the Colony for 12 months, or a denizen of Western Australia; have possessed for at least 1 year before being registered, and within the electoral province for which he seeks to be registered: (a) either a leasehold estate of the clear value of 10l.; above all charges and encumbrances affecting the same; or have been a householder for the last preceding 6 months, the dwelling house being of the clear annual value of 25l.; or (c) holder of a leasehold of the clear annual value of 25l., the lease having 18 months to run; or (d) holder of a leasehold, for the last preceding 18 months, of the annual value of 25l.; or (e) holder of a lease or licence from the owner at an annual rental of at least 10l.; or (f) has his name on the electoral list of a Municipality or Roads Board in respect of property within the district.

The Governor is advised by the following responsible ministers, who form the Cabinet:—The Colonial Treasurer (also Colonial Secretary), the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, the Director of Public Works (also Commissioner of Railways), and the Minister for Mines and Education.

Local Government.

Under Act 59 Vict., No. 10, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All license fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following municipalities have been proclaimed: Albany, Beverley, Bunbury, Busselton, Carnarvon, Coolgardie, Cossack, Cue, Day Dawn, Esperance, Fremantle, Geraldton, Gingin, Guildford, Helena Vale, Kalgoorlie, Menzies, Mulwala, Newcastle, Northam, North Fremantle, Perth, Roebourne, Southern Cross, York. The municipal councils in towns where the population does not exceed 1,000, consist of a chairman and six councillors; where the population is between 1,000 and 5,000, of a mayor and nine councillors; where the population exceeds 5,000, a mayor and for each ward three councillors—the mayor and chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licenses to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. Under "The Water Works Act, 1889" (53 Vic. 13), the Perth City Council is authorized to make and levy a rate not exceeding 1s. in the £; also under "The Public Health Act, 1886." Councils of Municipalities to which the provisions of the Act have been extended are required to make and levy a special rate not exceeding 3d. in the £; 31,893l. was granted in 1895 to district roads boards (of which there are 64) and municipal councils (25) for the repair and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony.

Population and Chief Towns.

The total population of the Colony at the 31st December, 1895, was estimated to be 101,235, consisting of 69,727 males, and 31,508 females, excluding the aboriginal natives. The number of Chinese was 1,331, of whom 1,321 were males and only 10 females.

The chief towns are Perth (19,533), Fremantle (9,500), Albany (3,000), Geraldton (2,500), York (2,009), Bunbury (800), and Guildford.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 6,152,332 acres only have been alienated, while 83,972,865 acres are leased for pastoral, and 2,107,387 for other purposes. No less than 530,356,216 acres are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 3,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cam-
bridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, five hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley, Encla, and interior goldfields districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes. In the south-west corner of the Colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is 218,239 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,295,832) are depastured in all parts of the Colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The export of wool in 1895, principally to London, was 8,290,806 lbs. which, at 5½d. per lb., is valued at 183,510L. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

The forest area lies between south latitude 31° and 35°. West Australian "jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for paving, railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. The export of timber for 1895 was valued at 88,146L. Sandalwood is still abundant, and was exported to Singapore and China, to the extent of about 30,863I. during 1895.

At Shark's Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to 47,298I. in 1895.

For a long period lead and copper mines were held and worked in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but for the last few years little work has been done in them, owing to the fall in the value of these metals. The prospects in copper are, however, improving.

The other mineral resources of Western Australia were almost unknown, and quite undeveloped until recently. Gold was found in considerable quantity in the Kimberley goldfield in 1887; and although the field is now in a very depressed condition, chiefly owing to its distance and the great expense of any transactions there, it attracted a large number of experienced miners, and the result has been the discovery of gold in greater quantities elsewhere.

There are now (November, 1896) fourteen goldfields in existence.—Kimberley, Pilbara, West Pilbara, Ashburton, Murchison, East Murchison, Yalgoo, Yilgarn, Coolgardie, East Coolgardie, North-East Coolgardie, North Coolgardie, Dundas, and Dundalup, and a large population constantly employed in searching for, and extracting, precious metals.

Much machinery is now in operation, and the fields appear to be well established, with a bright future before them, judging from the steady increase both in returns and population. The value of gold exported up to the end of 1896 was 2,608,169L. The gold export during 1895 was 879,748L.

There is also evidence of the existence of coal both in the south-west corner of the Colony and in the vicinity of Champion Bay and Irwin river. Coal is also said to exist in the Kimberley district.

At the end of 1896 large deposits of silver were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Goldwood River, and this export appears to have been valued at 9,703L. There is little doubt that a rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in very small quantities, near Perth.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia Limited, Bank of New South Wales, the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of Australasia.

The average amount of their deposits for the year ending the 31st December, 1895, was £2,589,727L., and their note circulation £214,678L.

A Government Post Office saving bank, with branch offices, was established in 1895. Deposits during the year, ended 30th June, 1896, amounted to £217,930L.; and during the year ended 30th June, 1896, to £20,016L.

A branch of the Royal Mint will shortly be established in Perth.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are under the supervision of the Minister of Education, assisted by elected district boards. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (Vic., No. 30), and are enforced.

Assisted schools of different denominations are also subsidised by the State. The amount expended on education for 1895 was £26,375L.; school buildings £13,851L. A high school is also subsidised by the State.

In January, 1896, there were 153 Government schools in the Colony, with 6,451 scholars on the rolls, and 19 assisted schools, with 2,293 scholars. Total 8,744.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present four lines of Government railways: The Eastern Railway (135 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford, York, and Beverley, with branch lines from Clackline Junction to Newcastle (14 miles), from Spencer Brook Junction to Northam (6 miles), and a mile to the Perth racecourse; the Northern Railway, with a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district; one from Geraldton to Walkaway (18 miles); one from Geraldton to Mullewa (57 miles); the South-Western Railway, from Perth to Bunbury.
Fremantle is a port of registry, with 155 vessels and a tonnage of 8,274 on 31st December, 1895.

Defence.

In December, 1895, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 665 of all ranks. Of this number 97 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder to the various rifle corps. King George's Sound, on the south coast, is being strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office. The port of Fremantle is also about to be fortified.

Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They were, and still are, very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement has been very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they used to be largely utilised as pearl-shell divers, whilst their industry was confined to moderately shallow waters. As a general rule they are not hostile, though at times very troublesome, especially when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful. There is now a Board of Management appointed by the Governor, which deals with all matters connected with the aborigines.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The mean average death-rate is 16 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 33·367 inches, and the mean temperature is 61°. The rainy season extends from April to September.

The Windward Islands.

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south. St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago has been united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British Colonies are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and its population about 146,000.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of the several federal unions may be conveniently noted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Great Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1816 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, Governor-in-Chief being resident at Port of Spain with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in the general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. It was united to Trinidad 1st Jan., 1889.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is spoken, except in Grenada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language with the possible French patois.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also the Secretary. There is no common legislature, common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the islands and of Barbados. The colonies have united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. An audit system was instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sovereigns and double sovereigns, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but a "Colonial Bank," which has branches in larger islands, issues five-dollar notes. Private accounts are kept in sterling, but banking is generally carried on in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch all the Windward Islands. The usual length of voyage from England to Grenada is about 15 days; this includes a delay of about 10 hours at Barbados for the purpose of transhipping passengers and cargo from the transatlantic to the interocean steamer.

The steamers of Scrutton's Direct Line call at least once a month, and there is also direct nightly communication between Grenada and New York, Grenada being the first and last of call.

There are no railways in any of the islands, but a government telephone system of exchanges has been constructed at Grenada, and connected with the out-districts with the town of St. George's. A similar system is in course of construction at St. Vincent. All three islands of the group have telegraphic communication with Europe and other West Indian islands by cable to St. Thomas and St. Croix. The rate per word for telegrams to Europe from Grenada is 9s. 11½d.
