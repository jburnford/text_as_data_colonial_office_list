QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the Colony.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the Colony of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,080 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was however not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Maine, the mean temperature being high but equable. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 65°, the extremes being from 35° to 106°. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from Nov. to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, all of which are navigable for good-sized vessels. A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuous main range, or Cordillera, of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the parallel of south latitude, and thence westwardly to the western boundary. Another range branches off the main range about lat. 21° south and 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula; its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Ker Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of trees. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Sugar growing has now become a very important industry. In 1895 there were 74,247 acres of cane, of which 55,771 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 86,255 tons of sugar.

Maize was grown on 100,481 acres, and returned a yield of 2,391,378 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ending 31st Dec., 1895, 1,061 acres yielded 1,574,729 lbs. of cured leaf. Manufactured in the Colony during the year, 492,441 lbs., cigars, 1,266 lbs., cigarettes, 9,118 lbs.

In 1895 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 194 acres, which yielded 346,853 lbs.

Much of the country to the west of the divided range of mountains is elevated table-land, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of trees, but well grassed and watered. Within a short distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba, Warwick, and Roma, on the Darling Downs. In 1895, 2,414 acres were planted with this cereal, principally in the localities mentioned. Out of the total area planted, 1,344 acres were mown for hay, and 27,090 acres yielded 123,630 bushels of grain. 1,216 acres were cut for green forage. Unfortunately during 1895 the severe drought resulted in practically a failure for all cereal crops except maize.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming.
and there are 3,339 squatting "runs" of land, containing 413,879 sq. miles, from the Government at a very low annual rate in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

The chief exports are: Wool, 85,438,743 lbs., valued at £2,991,413l.; gold, 2,272,109l.; sugar, 7l.; live stock, 339,890l.; tin, 74,187l.; hides and skins, 48,378l.; meat, 985,889l.; and hides and skins, 436,500l.; tallow, 595,992l. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware, and nery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australian colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, China, and the United Kingdom.

Mining industry is one of the most important in the Colony, and gives employment to 21,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district—which includes the famous Mt. Morgan, Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of smaller gold mines, some of considerable value, are worked in twenty-four districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total quantity exported during 1895 amounted to 692,167 oz. Herberton district is the headquarters of the iron, tin, and copper mining industries, but districts of Cooktown, Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, and others also contribute largely to the output of these metals, amongst which also should be included bismuth, antimony, wolfram, and quicksilver. Excellent opals are also obtained from the northern and extreme south-western portions of the Colony. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burram and Peak districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being worked depends solely on the opening of a market. The total output for 1895 was 39,068 tons, valued at 132,530l.

Timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The underwood supplies the hardwood, which is most abundant: flooded gum, iron bark, blackbutt, stringybark, spotted gum, bloodwood, yellow wood, dark yellow wood,* &c., &c. These woods are especially valuable for making bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and general work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton pine, kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky pine, wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts or preparations which are attracting notice in Europe and America, may be mentioned—Eucalyptus molyneuxii, the extract of which is used as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia scholaris, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia erythropoda, the extract of which is effective in erysipelas and fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or asthmatic herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark, when distilled, yields an essential oil equal in value to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1895, 229 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 28,195.

Water Supply.

There has been advanced to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the Colony, a sum of £973,901l.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 668,497 square miles comprising the area of the Colony. At least 424 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from 4,010 feet, the depth of the government bore at Winton, to 60 feet. The aggregate quantity of boring done in search of artesian water amounts in all to 457,879 feet; 270 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons to 4,000 gallons per bore, and the aggregate total output is some 395,773,450 gallons per diem. Generally stated the waters are soft and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 230 lbs. per square inch, as at the government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 196° to 709° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the government hydraulic engineer at 637,861l., exclusive of the cost of casings which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000l., so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amount expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the Colony and already about 5,000 acres are artificially watered by some 112 irrigationists. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51·20 per cent. in 5 years, and the census of 5th April, 1891, shows the population to be about 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,919 females; Chinese about 8,574, Polynesians about 9,428, and other Asiatic races about 1,832. The balance of the population are mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. This does not include aborigines, of whom there are believed to be about 30,000 in the Colony.

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 87 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 186,937. The receipts of the local authorities in 1895 were 511,616l.; their expenditure 488,641l.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control 41,738,317l., and debt 1,559,876l. Debts for water works, amounting to 778,516l., which are due principally from these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully
situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, has a population, according to census, 1891 (five mile radius), 93,657; (ten mile radius), 102,167. It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast, and the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (9,564), Ipswich (7,625), Maryborough (8,700), Rockhampton (11,787), Gympie (8,449), and Toowoomba (7,007).

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 31st December, 1895, 11 banks, with 156 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as 2,165,179L.; deposits, 11,022,209L. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 56,421; the amount of deposits as 2,286,810L.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

On the 31st December, 1895, the railways in Queensland showed 2,379 miles in operation, the cost of construction being 16,603,427L., the revenue 1,080,351L., and the working expenses 608,709L. The following lines are now open for traffic:

THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN from Brisbane to Charleville; with its branches, Ipswich to Dougandan, Brisbane Valley Junction to Esk, Gowrie Junction via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crows Nest, Wyreema to Pittsworth, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to Norang, with branches to Beandercet, Soutport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Rosedale, with branches to Sandgate, Kilkivan, Woowonga, Childers, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre. Tenders have now been let to complete this line from Rosedale to Gladstone.

THE CENTRAL RAILWAY is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches to Springsure and Clermont; also one to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 23 miles of railway are open to Mirani, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

THE BOWEN RAILWAY is also open from that port to Wangeratta, a distance of 48 miles.

THE NORTHERN RAILWAY is open from Townsville to Hughenden, with a branch to Ravenswood, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter town a great gold-mining centre, having a population of about 10,000 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook and Carpentaria Division a railway is being constructed to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 67 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also in course of construction from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Herberton, the great tin-mining centre, a considerable portion of which is now open for traffic. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, south-easterly.

There are 366 electric telegraph stations in the Colony. The number of miles of line 9,979, with 17,790 miles of wire. The receipts were 76,011L.

The number of messages during 1895 was 1,055,615. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 776 subscribers who use aerial cables containing multiple wires, being used to reduce the inconvenience of number of separate wires in the street.

Communication with London is maintained by Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks with supplementary steamers occasionally. Brindisi and Melbourne every fortnight, San Francisco and Sydney every four weeks via the Cape every month. The average of passage by Brindisi and Torres Straits is nine days. There is daily communication with Sydney and Melbourne, and Adelaide by frequent communication with all the ports of Australasia and with Singapore. The postage rates are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vic. No. 1. Its central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local boards assist the department with advisory supervision. There are 738 schools, containing 64,690 children on the roll. The schools are public and unsectarian. There are also 193 private schools, with 12,581 children on the roll in 1895. There are no local rates for education, which is paid for by the whole Colony.

Defence.

The defence force of Queensland is organized under the Defence Act of 1884, including the militia of 1891, and consists of mounted infantry and garrison artillery, engineers, and rifle clubs. Under the Act all male inhabitants of Queensland, between the ages of eighteen and sixty years, and who are British subjects, but not specially exempted, are, in case of war,
The police are liable for service in case of emergency.

The force is commanded by an officer, who is styled the "Commandant of the Queensland Defence Force." Every officer, except officers of the regular army, receives, in the first instance, a provisional appointment, and obtains a commission as lieutenant, after passing an examination conducted by a Board of Examiners appointed by the Governor for the purpose.

Training.

Classes of instruction for officers and non-commissioned officers are formed twice during the year for periods of one month for each course. Special classes are also formed in addition as required. Recruits for the several arms join special squads which are formed as required in the different centres. Instruction is afforded by instructors of the permanent staff, and when the squad has performed 20 drills it is inspected by a staff officer, and those recruits who pass inspection are allowed to join the ranks of trained men in the corps in which they enrolled. All corps are inspected annually by the Commandant. Staff officers of the respective arms visit outlying districts periodically, and attend parades and drills of corps, and afford instruction, and give lectures on special subjects. The force is called out annually for continuous training for a period not exceeding eight days. Officers provide their own arms, accoutrements, and uniforms.

Immigration.

The arrivals from Europe for the year 1895 were 375. The arrivals from Hong Kong and China numbered 561, and of Polynesians from the South Sea Islands, 1,312.

By Act 53 Vic., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vic., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government or a household in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 39 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act No. 10 of 1887, as amended by the Electoral Districts Act of 1892, the Colony is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.
