WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and
for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an
Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific
Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better
carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders'
Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a
Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between
British subjects living in these islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner
extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not
being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji,
Queensland, or New South Wales, and not being
within the jurisdiction of any civilised power, and
includes the Southern Solomon Islands, the New
Hebrides, the Tongan or Friendly Islands, the
Samoan or Navigators' Islands, and the various small
groups of Melanesia. In 1893 a new Order-in-
Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order-in-
Council, 1893, in accordance with which the
High Commissioners' Jurisdiction is extended to
foreigners, and (in most cases) to natives residing
in British settlements or protectorates within the
limits of the Order. The expenses of the High
Commission are met from Imperial funds, Class V.,
vote 5, the total in 1890-91 being

With some few exceptions all decisions of the
High Commissioner's Court may be appealed
against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the pro-
visions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts
1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases
occurring where there is no resident Deputy Com-
missioner, certain officers in command of His
Majesty's ships of war on the Australian stations
have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving
order the High Commissioner has certain special
powers for the deportation of persons whose pro-
ceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

PRINCIPAL GROUPS UNDER THE HIGH
COMMISSIONER.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, situated between the 15th and 23rd degrees
of west longitude. The islands are mostly of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes,
notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafouo (Goolong Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and the (dried kernel of the nut) forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group. There is regular steam communication with Auckland (1,000 miles distant) and Sydney (1,400 miles), and occasional steamers and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles). Some vessels carry the copra to Europe.

The late king, George Tubou, was the head of its chiefs or kings to establish an efficient government over the whole of Tonga, and his rule on the whole was fairly successful. The king is assisted by a native parliament called privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Customs, Education, and Marine Departments, the whole of the government officials are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of India, and licences are charged for carrying on commerce and trades. The revenue and expenditure are about 16,000l. per annum. According to the latest returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1888 | £48,376 | £66,888 |
| 1889 | £45,240 | £80,306 |
| 1890 | £28,832 | £45,325 |
| 1891 | £51,929 | £75,400 |
| 1892 | £51,266 | £53,957 |
| 1893 | £64,682 | £79,223 |
| 1894 | £82,330 | £67,632 |
| 1895 | £87,240 | £113,240 |

but the value of the copra exported is about 20 per cent too high. The native population is 19,196; the European about 353. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53° and 93° Fahrenheit.

There are three Churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years ago with present about 3,000 adherents only); the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; and the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents. The Free Church...
WESTERN PACIFIC.

Established in 1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakagoo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Waldemar Baker, Premier, an ex-Wesleyan Missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakagoo," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church, whose houses were pillaged, and who were beaten with sticks and whips till they declared their adhesion to the "Free Church." About 100, whom no ill-will could induce to abandon the Mission religion, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren inhospitable islet south of Tonga; but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At the inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakagoo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was handed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at Apia recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that natives were deprived of their lands and unjustly fined on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell begging to accord freedom of worship. Sir Charles therefore made a further inquiry, finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he, in accordance with the powers conferred on the High Commissioner by the Western Pacific Orders in Council, issued an order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from 1st July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a new Premier (Tukuako). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled to Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Burton to make the necessary arrangements for their return.

King George Tupou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, Prince Taufanau, under the title of George Tupou II. The present Premier is Josateki Toga, who has been educated abroad. Higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine, and local police, not recognized as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

The SAMOAN OR NAVIGATOR ISLANDS are situated between the 13th and 15th parallels of south latitude, and the 169th and 174th degrees of west longitude. The inhabitants, about 25,000 in number, belong to the Polynesian race. The islands, which are of volcanic origin, are very fertile. The principal export is copra, but cotton, coffee, and bananas are also exported. A considerable portion of the land has been alienated, part of which is cultivated by British and German residents. The Hamburg Commercial and Planting Company of the South Seas has extensive plantations, and also has at Samoa its principal depot for South Sea trade.

No effective Government had been established before 1889. The present King Malietoa was recognised as king in 1879, and Tamasese his principal opponent, was given the title of Vice-King. In 1884, Tamasese formed a party to depose Malietoa and place himself on the throne. The German Government, which was displeased with Malietoa for refusing to ratify a treaty giving Germany a preponderating influence in the affairs of Samoa, favoured the pretensions of Tamasese. In 1886 a commission was appointed consisting of commissioners from Germany, Great Britain, and the United States, with a view to arrive at an agreement respecting Samoan affairs. After the commissioners had reported to their respective Governments, a conference was held at Washington, but no agreement was arrived at. In 1887 Tamasese, with the assistance of the German forces, obtained possession of the seat of Government; and Malietoa, having surrendered himself to the German Consul-General, was deported in a German man-of-war to West Africa, whence he was afterwards removed to the Marshall group. An attempt was then made to organise an efficient government throughout Samoa under Tamasese, Herr Brandeis being made Premier. But after a little while the adherents of Malietoa, under the leadership of his relative Mataafa, took arms against Tamasese, and occupied a position close to Apia, the seat of Government. In December, 1888, at the instance of the German Consul, an ineffectual attempt was made to dislodge Mataafa by an armed party from German men-of-war. The German Government having disapproved the action of their Consul, proposed that a fresh conference should be held. A conference was accordingly held at Berlin, and a convention arrived at between Germany, Great Britain, and the United States with regard to the future government of Samoa. In accordance with this convention, Malietoa was reinstated as king, and a Supreme Court of Samoa was constituted, with a Chief Justice appointed by the three Powers. The Chief Justice is also the king's principal legislative adviser. Further disturbances took place in 1893, and the three powers were compelled to intervene, and Mataafa and some of his followers were removed from the Group to the Marshall Islands.

The township of Apia is managed by a municipal council consisting of six members elected by the ratepayers, and of a president appointed by the three Treaty Powers. Bye-laws for the payment of rates, prevention of diseases, and the preservation of good order are enforced by a municipal magistrate, whose decisions are open to review by the Chief Justice.

British subjects are under the jurisdiction of the high commissioner's court in respect of all criminal offences not cognisable by the municipal magistrate, and in all civil cases other than suits relating to realty, where both parties are British subjects. The supreme court exercises jurisdiction in all suits relating to real property, or where the parties are of different nationalities, and also exercises complete jurisdiction over the nationals of all countries which have not established their own courts in Samoa.
The London Missionary Society, the Wesleyan Mission of Australasia, and the Roman Catholic Society of Mary have all established churches in Samoa, the adherents of the first named being the most numerous. English and German schools are established in Apia.

Apia, the principal town, has about 350 European inhabitants. The climate is not good, and the heat is frequently oppressive. But plantations situated a few hundred feet above the sea are not unhealthy.

There is regular steam communication with Auckland (distant 1,600 miles) and Sydney (2,450 miles), and occasional steam and sailing vessels run between Samoa and Fiji (450 miles).

The Union Group consists of three small islands, Fakaofo, Oatafu, and Nukunono, about 9° S. latitude and 172° W. longitude. The islands are coral atolls, and the principal article of trade is copra. The natives are of Polynesian race, and are over 1,000 in number. They are ruled by their own chiefs with the assistance of native councils. A British Protectorate has been proclaimed over this group. The inhabitants are either adherents of the London Missionary Society, or Roman Catholics.

The Ellice and Gilbert Groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 5° N. latitude and 10° S. latitude, and 170° to 180° E. longitude. The principal export is copra. The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race, and number about 30,000; and are most of them adherents of American missions, or of the London Missionary Society. The islands have separate kings or chiefs, who are assisted by councils of chiefs and commoners. Labourers go for periods of three years to Fiji and Tahiti, and have also been recruited for Mexico. These groups have now been placed under British protection. Courts of law have been established amongst the natives, and a revenue is obtained from native contributions and trade licenses, which it is expected will cover the cost of maintaining a regular government in the islands. The efforts of Mr. C. R. Swayne, the first British Resident, to establish an efficient system of administration have met with considerable success.

The Southern Solomon Islands consist of the islands of New Georgia, Guadalcanal, Malayta, San Cristoval, and smaller islands in the vicinity of the above, lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 156th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians. Stations have been established by the Melanesian Mission, but the converts are not numerous. The natives are treacherous, and most of them are cannibals. There are a few resident traders, mostly of British nationality. A large number of natives used to go to work on plantations in Queensland, Fiji and Samoa, returning after the expiration of three years; but the number is less than formerly. The principal articles of trade are copra, pearl shell, and tortoiseshell. The climate is not a good one. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893, and a Resident has now been appointed. His headquarters will be at Tulagi, a small island on the north side of Guadalcanal, which has been purchased for the purpose of establishing a Residency.

The Santa Cruz Islands are situated between the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides Group. The natives are Melanesians, and are mostly adherents of the Melanesian Mission. The principal trade is in copra.

The New Hebrides Group lies between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The population has been estimated at from 100,000 to 140,000, but the Mission returns place it at only 50,000. Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church. The larger number of natives are still cannibals. Life is, however, safer than in the Solomon Islands. Native labourers go to Queensland, Fiji, Samoa, or New Caledonia; but in much smaller numbers than formerly. There is a European population of about 180, mostly British or French. French Australian companies have been formed for trading and planting purposes. A British steamer, connecting with steamers from Sydney, runs regularly in the group, and occasionally a French steamer runs from New Caledonia. The principal export is copra; but bananas, coffee, timber, and sugar are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is bad, and malarial fever is prevalent. A joint commission, consisting of British and French naval officers, has been appointed to protect lives and property of British and French subjects and to maintain order.

Cook or Hervey Islands Protectorate.

The Cook Islands are about 1,700 miles from Auckland by steamer. The most southerly, Mangaia, is in latitude 21° 47' south, and the most northerly, Atitutaki, in 18° 15' south. Rarotonga, the most westerly, is in 160° west, and Mauke, the furthest to the east, lies in 157° west longitude. The group consists of seven islands—Mangaia, Atiu, Mauke, Mitiao, the Hervey Islands proper, Atitutaki, and Rarotonga. The so-called Hervey Islands are an atoll, with the usual low islets of the surrounding reef, and are frequented by the natives from Atitutaki to make copra from the coconuts, which grow luxuriantly and without care in such positions.

Rarotonga is the most important, being the only island in the group with harbours. There are several small harbours in the coral reef with which this island is fringed. The best of these, Avatiu, is the centre of trade for the group. There is also good anchorage outside the reef. Rarotonga is very beautiful and fertile, having a volcanic surface covered with coral subsoil. The island is small—a little over 25 miles in circuit—but the central hills rise to a height of nearly 3,000 feet. Water is consequently good and abundant. The climate is good and unusually cool. The native population is over 2,000. The foreign residents number some 50 adult natives engaged in trade or planting. They are chiefly British, with a mixture of Americans, Germans, French, and Chinese. There is a resident European missionary, and a native school in which teachers are trained for mission service in other islands in connection with the London Missionary Society. Several of these teachers have for a time past been doing good service in other Pacific Islands, and in New Guinea.

Mangaia is of about the same size as Rarotonga, but chiefly a coral formation, and is
The climate is equally good, but the hills do not reach 500 feet in height. The population about 2,000, with only 4 Europeans who are engaged in trade. There is a resident English missionary and native school.

**Atiu** is smaller than Mangaia, but of the same character. It is surrounded by an oceanal reef as well as a shore reef. The ocean reef said to be 60 miles in circuit, and the lagoon is formed off one end of the island is a large net of water capable, by a moderate outlay, of being made suitable for large vessels. Population: 1,500, with only one European trader. There is also a resident English missionary and native school.

**Atiu, Mauke,** and **Mitiaro** are all under the rule of Atiu. Atiu resembles Atutaki, but Mauke and Mitiaro are smaller. The joint populations are about 1,800. There are only two foreign residents, and the missionaries in charge are native teachers from Karotonga.

Communication within each island is entirely by paths or tracks. They have no river nor coastal navigation. Between the islands communication is entirely by sailing vessel; very uncertain and irregular. From Tahiti come regular trading vessels, also from San Francisco. The only steam communication is by the "Richmond" on her round trip from Auckland to Tonga, Samoa, and Tahiti, stopping at Karotonga once in five weeks, on her return from Tahiti to Auckland.

**Productions.**—Cotton, coffee, tobacco, copra, wroot, fungus, oranges, limes, bananas, and all tropical fruits flourish luxuriantly. Orange and coconut trees produce abundantly, and of excellent quality, and all kinds of native food—taro, breadfruit, kumera, yams, bananas, and the indigenous taro, are fine and plentiful. Many products of the temperate clime do well, and cattle, except sheep, thrive well on an indigenous species of grass or wire grass.

**Administration.**

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Wake, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Mannai, Aotearoa, and Takutia by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

The Resident is paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reports direct to the Governor of New Zealand Colony. Since his appointment he has succeeded in arranging for the election of a general assembly to make laws for the group. The Government is carried on by the Ariki or Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, whose husband is Ariki, king of Atiu, has been acknowledged as head of the Government, and an Executive Council, which the Ariki are ex officio members, has been appointed. A Supreme Court has been established, and a law has been passed regulating the sale of intoxicants and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 5 per cent. on imports. The laws are subject to the approval of the Resident.

**Trade.**

The principal exports in 1893 were cotton, 1,603 lbs., value $20,461; coffee, 191,499 lbs., value $42,950; copra, 13,692 cwt., value $18,077; pearls, value $16,917, and pearl shell, value $4,458. The total exports in 1892 were $135,572, and in 1893 $131,117. The imports in the same years were $16,249l. (sterling) and $19,284l.

**OTHER MISCELLANEOUS POSSESSIONS.**

**ADEN.**

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. Besides the peninsula a strip of territory stretching about three miles inland belongs to England, the whole area being about seventy square miles. Dhala and El Hota are the principal villages outside the town of Aden. The rainfall never exceeds 7 inches in a year. The town of Aden is situated on the side of a rocky promontory, and is very strongly fortified. It is a most important coaling station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The imports in 1887 amounted to 1,870,507l., and the exports to 1,507,718l. The exports consist of coffee, dyes, feathers, gums, spices, &c. The imports from Great Britain in 1887 were 155,670l., and the exports to were 337,724l. The settlement is subject to the government of Bombay, being presided over by a president, who is also commander of the troops in the garrison. (For further information see publications relating to India.)

**Perim,** an island situated at the entrance of the Red Sea, is a dependency of Aden, and is administered from that port. It contains a lighthouse.

**Socotra,** an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19'—12° 42' N. lat., and 53° 21'—53° 30' E. long, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island...
is about 4,000, of Arab descent. It is 72 miles by 22 miles, with peaks 200 feet high. It was formally annexed in October 1886, with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.

In 1887 also a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali coast, extending from the point of Ras Jiburté on the southern coast of the Bay of Tadjaura to Bundee Ziadele in the 94 parallel E. long. The protectorate is regulated under the "Somali Order in Council" of 13th December, 1889, by the Acting Consul for the Somali Coast, Lieut.-Col. E. V. Stace.
