ST. HELENA.
Situation, Area, &c.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,300 from the coast of Africa, in 15° 53' S. 5° 42' W. long. It is 10½ miles long and 3½ wide, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Cape Town, 1,695 miles. The usual mail route is, from England, 17 days, and from Canada, 6 days.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, N.W. of the island, with a population of 2,000. The climate is mild, and varies between 68° and 80°, and in winter between 70° and 75°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall in 1895 was 32 inches in the country. The air is very healthy, the average death-rate for three years ended 1893 having been only 1,000, including seamen landed in the island seriously ill. The death rate in 1895 was 1,000, or taken by ages:—Under 10 years, death rate of 43·6 per 1,000; over 10 and under 20, death rate of 6·1 per 1,000; over 70, death rate of 1·1 per 1,000.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well known, was discovered by the Portuguese Captain Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch took it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1665 it was taken by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they tried to drive out finally in May, by Sir Robert Munden, of the English Navy.
sued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment here, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was under the direct government of the Colony by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.
Government maintain 4 schools, having 853 pupils. There are also 7 endowed and private schools, not aided by Government, having 898 pupils. School attendance is compulsory under the Education Act No. 4 of 1874, and fees of 1d. a week are charged. The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1895-96 were £930l. and £919l.

Industry.
St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, and is abundant. It is situated in the heart of the Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the north about 330 days in the year, and in the direct line vessels homeward bound from the East Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for quantities of shipping and passengers to India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the trade, large establishments were maintained both civil and military. For many years it served as a depot for liberated Africans landed from ships captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818, a law was passed that all future imports into the Island should be free.

The supply of the passing shipping has produced any article of export properly so except flax fibre. The company which established this industry failed from bad management in reporting the green leaves to town for sale. For every 100 tons so transported at cost the yield was only about three tons of flax. Hundreds of acres of flax are now going waste. Its trade depends exclusively upon the success and the visits of the Antarctic whalers, who are in distress, and has greatly diminished in recent years in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal.

A number of ships calling at Jamestown (a free port) for supplies, including steamers, have been calling there since 1885, 450; in 1886, 377; in 1887, 317; in 1888, 330; in 1889, 288; in 1890, 211; in 1891, 223; in 1892, 199; in 1893, 203. It is a port of registry. The chief industries are fishing and agriculture, the main staple crop being potatoes.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865, with deposits on 31st December, 1895—£14,666l., and the Government issues bills of exchange on demand at 1 per cent.

Means of Communication.
Farmers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and back; steamers arrive from thence at the same interval, and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 3 weeks. Rate of postage to England and the Colonies, 6d. per oz.; to other places, 7½d. per oz. There is no internal post, but there are 11 telegraph stations, constructed by the Colonial Office and the War Office at a cost of 700l. The receipts in 1895 were £87l., and the expenses £20l. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are the Canaries, Capetown, and Loanda. The net postal revenue in 1895 was £1,795l., and the expenditure £226l.

Defence.
Jamestown has been made a second-class imperial coaling station, and extensive defensive works have been constructed on the heights overlooking the harbour.

Constitution.
The Government is administered by a Governor, assisted by an Executive Council. The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of Her Majesty in Council.

Situation and Area.

Sierra Leone proper consists of a peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, and bounded on the north by a river of the same name. The cape lies in 8° 30' N. lat., 13° 18' W. long. The peninsula is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth, with an area of 300 square miles. The Colony now includes the whole of the coast southward of the Mannah River, which forms the Liberia boundary, and northward to the Skarceis district, including the island of Sherbro, the Isles de Losso, Factory, Tamaera, and Cockle Islands, and Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellaboo, Teemo, Tasso, Macaulay, and other islets.

The extreme length of the Colony is 150 miles, and its area about 4,000 square miles, little over half the size of Wales.

History.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone, was ceded to Great Britain in 1787 by the native chiefs. Four years afterwards a charter was granted to a Company under the name of "The Sierra Leone Company," for the purpose of establishing a settlement for freed negro slaves. In 1791 a grant of the peninsula was made to the Company by Letters Patent, and the Court of Directors of the Company was empowered to appoint Governor and Council, the former having power to enact laws. In 1807, on the abolition of the slave trade, the Colony was transferred back to the Crown. In 1821, on the abolition of the African Company (see under Gold Coast), the whole of the British possessions in West Africa were united into the Colony of the West Africa Settlement. The Gold Coast was, however, soon added to the merchants, and the Gambia was made a separate Colony in 1843.

In 1862 two large tracts of country, the British Kwaini and Sherbro were handed over to treaty to the Colony. In 1879 further territory was acquired in the Skarceis River to the north of the peninsula. In 1884 the seaboard of the Sulymah and Gallinas Chiefs as far as the Mannah River was also annexed.

Constitution.

By a Charter issued on May 27, 1863, an Executive Council was created, composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone, was established by a Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1863.

By a new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1865, so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1863, was revoked as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements; but those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter was then issued, dated 17th of December, 1874, which created a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a legislative council for each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent were issued on the 17th June, 1885, providing for the continuance of...
Government on the same lines, with some differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., the Gambia was again made a separate government. Under these, the Governor is aided by an executive council composed of five officials, a legislative council, of which the Governor is the president, is composed of the members of the executive council, as official members, and three special members nominated by the Crown.

Climate.

The climate of Sierra Leone is unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The seasons are divided into wet and dry; the former commencing in May, lasting till October. The beginning and end of the wet season are the most sickly periods of the year. The average mean temperature is 83°, the extreme range being from 64°5° to 91° in the shade.

The rain-fall during the past four years has averaged over 138 inches in Freetown.

General Description.

The capital, Freetown, lying about 4 miles up Sierra Leone River at the foot of a chain of rising 1,700 feet, contains 30,033 inhabitants, possesses the best harbour in West Africa, an important coaling station and commercial port, and has been selected as a second class naval coaling station. It is a port of registry, and on 31st December, 1894, vessels registered had a total tonnage of 391 tons. The next largest towns are Waterloo in the Eastern District and Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

The Colony contains many different races of inhabitants including a large number of Mahommedans and negroes. Treaties of friendship have long existed with the native chiefs beyond British territory as far inland as Foutah, and annual presents are paid to many of them in return for the protection of commerce and the internal peace.

The scenery is very like that of the West Indies. The soil is good for agricultural purposes, and there is an abundant supply of pure water. Tropical fruits grow luxuriantly, cattle and poultry are plentiful.

Industry.

The inhabitants are born traders, acting as such not only in the interior country beyond Sierra Leone, but on the Niger and in all the principal centres of West Africa, exchanging European goods for the native products. Agriculture is much neglected, and there are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths, boot-making, tanning, and mat-making. The products of the interior, which constitute the principal exports, are palm oil and kernels, boni seed, ground nuts, cola nuts, indiarubber, copal, hides, and ginger. The imports are chiefly spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, and hardware. Three-quarters of the imports come from the United Kingdom, each only takes a third of the exports, the rest going to the other African settlements, France, Germany, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Besides British currency, gold doubloons, eagles, and the coins of the Latin union, are current and legal tender. There is no Colonial coinage, and no note circulation. The British Bank of West Africa has a branch in the Colony. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had, in 1892—93, £842l. deposited, belonging to 2,643 depositors.

Education.

A system of Government grants and inspection was established in 1882. There are 89 elementary schools in the Colony, with 10,500 scholars; they are all denominational, and charge fees. Education is not compulsory. The Church Missionary Society has a successful secondary school in Freetown, and a training college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University. The Wesleyan Missionary Society possesses a progressive high school for boys. There are also in Freetown three high schools devoted to the task of female education.

Defence.

The head-quarters of Her Majesty’s Forces on the West Coast of Africa, consisting of a battalion of the West India Regiment (800 men), with detachments of Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery, and a company of Native Artillery, are stationed at Freetown. There is also an establishment for victualling and coaling ships of the Royal Navy. Batteries armed with heavy guns have been erected for the defence of Freetown harbour.

An armed police force, specially organised for frontier work, is maintained by the Colony.

Means of Communication.

Steamers leave Liverpool for Grand Canary and Freetown every Saturday, and for Madeira and Freetown every second Wednesday. The average length of passage is 14 days to Freetown. There is also regular steam communication with Hamburg, Havre, and Marseilles, as well as with Lisbon and Algiers.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, direct to Fathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. There are no railways or internal telegraphs. Horses do not thrive, and there is but little wheel traffic and few roads fit for it. Internal communication is mainly kept up by the network of rivers and lagoons.

The Sherbro River is navigable for over 20 miles (up to Yorktown), the Sierra Leone, or Roquelle River, for 40 miles (as far as Magbellie).
