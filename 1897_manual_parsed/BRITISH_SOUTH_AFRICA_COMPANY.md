BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA COMPANY.

Under the unofficial title of British Zambezia, or as it is known locally "Rhodesia," is included the whole of the region lying to the north and west of the South African Republic and the southern boundaries of the Congo Free State, and having as its eastern and western boundaries the Portuguese and German spheres. The River Zambezi divides it into two portions, which may be described as Zambezia and British Central Africa respectively.

**Zambezia.**

The western boundary of Zambezia is defined by the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890, the sphere of influence reserved to Germany being bounded (1) by a line from the mouth of the Orange River along the north bank to the point of its intersection by E. long. 20°; (2) from thence along E. long. 20° its intersection by S. lat. 22°, and thence eastward along that parallel to its intersection by E. long. 21°, and following that degree northward to its intersection by S. lat. 18°, it runs eastward along that parallel till it reaches the River Chobe, and descends the centre of the main channel of that river to its junction with the Zambezi, where it terminates.
Its eastern boundary, defined by the Anglo-Portuguese Agreement of the 11th June, 1891, is a line starting from a point opposite the mouth of the River Aroungwa or Loangwa, and running directly southwards as far as S. lat. 16°; follows that parallel to its intersection with E. long. 31°; and thence eastward direct to the point where the River Mazoe is intersected by E. long. 33°; it follows that degree southward to its intersection by S. lat. 18° 30'; thence it follows the upper part of the eastern slope of the Manica Plateau southwards to the centre of the main channel of the Sabi, follows that channel to its confluence with the Lunte, whence it strikes direct to the N.E. point of the frontier of the South African Republic, and follows the eastern frontier of the Republic, and the frontier of Swaziland to the River Maputo.

In tracing the frontier along the slope of the plateau no territory west of E. long. 32° 30' is to be comprised in the Portuguese sphere; and no territory east of E. long. 33° is to be comprised in the British sphere, but if necessary the line is to be deflected so as to leave Mutassa in the British sphere, and Massi-kessi in the Portuguese sphere.

In 1888 the southern region was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

The most important part of this territory is Matabeleland, and including the country around inhabited by the Mashonas, Makalakas, and other tribes. Matabeleland and Mashonaland are rich in gold reefs and other minerals, and the Mashona plateaus are well adapted for culture and European settlement.

The British South Africa Company is further empowered to take over the administration of other districts in Africa, subject to the approval of the Government, including the region to the north and west of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, embracing Khama's territory and the region between that and the German boundary. Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lo Bengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Machoutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the southeastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was reached on 12th Sept., 1890. The pioneers were then disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims.

In July 1893 the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's Police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters by the High Commissioner, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's Police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khama and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland Police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed at great loss. Lobengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Changani, and Mr Wilson with a small party of men were after heroic resistance killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from smallpox or fever.

In 1896, when the country was demanded of the Imperial troops had to be sent to the assistance of the Company's police and volunteers, and it was only after a prolonged struggle that peace was secured. The police in the Company's territories are now under the command of Sir H. Martin, who is directly responsible to the High Commissioner at Cape Town. A Parliamentary Committee is now engaged in enquiring into circumstances connected with Dr. Jameson's raid, and also into the general administration of the territory by the Company.

The country, though desert in parts, is in the main well adapted both for cultivation and agriculture, being situated principally on the high healthy plateau of Central South Africa.

Since the grant of the Royal Charter, the Company has extended the Cape Government Railway System from Kimberley to Vryburg, a distance of 126 miles, and this section has since been taken over by the Cape government. The Company has also formed the Bechuanaland Railway Company, Limited, to construct a further section from Vryburg to Mafeking, a distance of 98 miles. This was opened for traffic on 3rd October, 1894, and the extension of the line to Gaberones and Palapye has been opened, and it is expected to reach Bulawayo in Dec., 1897. Thence the line will be continued to Salisbury. The East Coast Railway is also to be continued to connect with the line from Vryburg to Bulawayo and Salisbury at Umtali. The railway is also being extended still farther end from Fontes Villa to Port Beira, so as to place Salisbury ultimately in direct communication with the sea coast. It has also extended the telegraph system from Mafeking to Fort Salisbury, in Mashonaland, a distance of over 800 miles. As a consequence of the Matabele Campaign, to which reference is made further on, the extension of the telegraph was carried out from Palapye to Bulawayo, where an office was opened on the 9th July, 1894. This line is now being extended to Charlestown, Gwelo, a further distance of 212 miles, placing Bulawayo in direct communication with Salisbury. A continuation of the telegraph line from Salisbury, via Umtali, to Chimoio, a distance of about 200 miles, has been constructed. Chimoio, being the present terminus of the Beira Railway. Stations have been opened at Mafeking, Ramotsts, Gaberones, Mochuli, Palla, Palapye, Macolou, Talu, Nguwetsi, Victoria, Charter, Bulawayo.
At the instance of Mr. Rhodes, the African Transcontinental Telegraph Company, Limited, was incorporated on the 27th December, 1892, with a capital of £140,000, with the object of extending the Company's telegraph system from Salisbury, Mashonaland, across the Zambesi, to Lusambo, in Nyasaland, and thence via Lakes Nyasa and Tanganyika to Uganda, the ultimate object being to connect with the terminus of the Egyptian Government system of telegraphs at Wady Halfa, facing Cape Town in through communication with Cairo. About 60 miles of line from Blantyre, near Lusambo, to Sunbno, in the direction of Tete, was completed on the 26th August last. It is anticipated that the entire section north from Salisbury to Lusambo, a total distance of about 400 miles, will be completed in June next, when a further extension of 700 miles to Ujiji, on Lake Tanganyika, will be taken in hand.

A regular postal service has been established by the new postal route via Bulawayo; it is possible to communicate by letter between London and Salisbury within 30 to 33 days, which only 11 are occupied by the journey from Cape Town. The mails also run weekly between Salisbury, Umtali and Beira, in from 5 to 7 days, thus providing a local East Coast service. The coaches running between the various districts afford also transport for both passengers and parcels. A company has been formed to construct a railway between Beira, on the east coast, and Mashonaland. The first section of 75 miles was opened for traffic on the 7th October, 1893, and a further extension to Chimoio, being a total railway run of 118 miles, was opened in the latter part of 1894. Arrangements are in hand for extending this to Umtali and Salisbury. A wagon road leads from the present terminus to Salisbury. This railway will prove most valuable to the development of the eastern portion of the country, by affording a cheap and easy means of access both for passengers and machinery.

Regular gold-workings were not commenced until July, 1891. In Mashonaland several distinct goldfields have been discovered, viz.:—

| District          | Length (miles) | Width (miles) |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Victoria          | 70            | 20           |
| Hartley Hill      | 50            | 14           |
| Laroze            | 40            | 30           |
| Moghundas         | 40            | 30           |
| Kaiser Wilhelm    | 30            | 25           |
| Concession Hill   |               |              |

Since the occupation of Matabeleland discoveries of gold-bearing districts have rapidly succeeded each other, finds having been made at Bulawayo, Sebakwe, Gwelo, Matope, Bembesi, Balingwe, Changuni, Selukwe, Gwanda, etc. On the 7th May, 1894, 7,003 claims were reported as pegged out in Matabeleland.

In addition the following number of claims in Mashonaland had been registered before end of July, 1893:—

| Claim             | Number        |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Umfuli            | 8,872         |
| Mazoe             | 6,265         |
| Victoria          | 5,871         |
| Lo Magunda        | 2,375         |
| Salisbury         | 3,290         |
| Manica            | 7,624         |

34,297

In addition to gold, other minerals have been found, and several claims have been pegged off on reefs showing silver, copper, blende, tin, antimony, arsenic, and lead, while deposits of nitrate of potassium and plumbago, and extensive coalfields, have also been discovered.

Townships have been surveyed and marked out at Salisbury, Victoria, Umtali, Hartley Hill, Bulawayo, and Gwelo. Stands have been sold at the first three places, the amount realized being nearly £18,000. Deputations sent into Mashonaland by Transvaal, Orange Free State, and Cape Colony farmers have reported in very favourable terms on the agricultural prospects of Mashonaland. A "trek" of farmers from the Orange Free State has already entered the country, and others are being organised, and a large number of farms have been allotted under the Company's land laws. In Mashonaland alone by September, 1894, farms representing a total of 1,722,274 acres had been actually surveyed; it was estimated that in Matabeleland 800 farms, aggregating 4,860,000 acres had been bescomed. The white population is estimated at about 3,000.

Printed newspapers are published at Salisbury, Bulawayo and Umtali. Hotels are to be found at frequent intervals along the main roads from Tuli to Salisbury, and from there to Umtali, while at Salisbury itself there are several substantial buildings of brick and iron, offering excellent accommodation. Branches of the Standard Bank and African Banking Corporation has been opened at Salisbury, Bulawayo, and Umtali, a Sanitary Board established, government offices and churches built, hospitals erected, and order and good government throughout the country provided for. Immediately upon the occupation of Bulawayo, a settled local government was adopted, with the result that as early as the end of August, 1894, there were 78 brick buildings erected, 61 in course of erection, and a white population of 2,020. An office was opened by the Standard Bank of South Africa.

The Company has from time to time equipped and despatched expeditions into various parts of Central Africa, as the result of which it has secured mining and administrative concessions from many chiefs.

The territories within the Company's sphere of influence north of the Zambesi (Northern Rhodesia) have been placed under the administration of Major Forbes, and arrangements have now been made for the organising of a Police Force under Capt. J. S. Nicholson.

The capital of the Company is 3,500,000l., out of which 500,000l. has not been issued, and of the remainder two-thirds are represented by cash subscriptions. The Company is already in receipt of revenue from mining, trading, and professional licences, stand holdings, and postal and telegraph services.

The London office of the Company is 15, St. Swithin's Lane, E.C.
