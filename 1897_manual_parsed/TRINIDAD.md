TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the
eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50'
N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° 0' of W. longitude
from Greenwich. Its average length is about 48
miles, and its average breadth 35 miles, and
its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated
from the continent of America by the Gulf of
Paria, into which fall the northern mouths
of the Orinoco. The distance between Chaca-
chacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands,
in which the north-western peninsula of the
island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory
on the other side of the strait is only seven miles.
The Colony now includes Tobago (formerly in
the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated
with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the
Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on
his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken
possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No
Governor was, however, appointed by the king of
Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years
afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest
difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.
It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by
Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his
visit by burning the newly founded town of
St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of
Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640, it was raided
by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690, by the
French. Towards the end of the 17th and the
beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely
and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon
the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made
scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in con-
sequence of the representations made to the
Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent,
a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit
to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary
fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was
issued, by which extraordinary advantages were
offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in
Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not
very strictly insisted upon, being that they should
profess the Roman Catholic religion. The conse-
quence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercrombie, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The estimated population of the colony at the end of 1895 was 237,934, and is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, Spanish, and a large proportion of East Indians, estimated at 84,503. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; and only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour at Chaguanas. The whole gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly rising the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet; the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1895 were: Sugar, 122,353,755 lbs.; and cocoa, 29,458,813 lbs. Tobacco of a superior quality is also grown. Molasses, rum, bitters, coconuts, and asphalt, are also exported.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about a million sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the last 4 years, 1892 to 1895, was 74-54 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1895 was 78-6° Fahr., the maximum being 90-3° in May, and the minimum 66° in February, and the rainfall 70-89 inches.

The island is divided into eight counties as shown on the map.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population in 1891, 33,273), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1895, 290 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 15,775 tons. Seven miles of tramway and 450 miles of road have been constructed in Port of Spain.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1891, 6,570), about 30 miles south of Port of Spain.

Both these towns possess elective municipal councils and mayors. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain. Population in 1891, 3,653. The municipal revenue of the three boroughs in 1895 was £22,992, the expenditure £21,188, and the rate £0.02 of San Fernando excepted, was £0.38.

A pitch lake, 109 to 114 acres in extent, situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it has considerable value, and has been leased to an American Company, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000£, and a royal tax on the out-put in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease for 21 years from 1st January, 1888; a further extension may be granted for another 21 years.

The revenue derived from the Pitch Lake in 1895 was £22,928l. 14s. 2d.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,120,000 acres, the alienated area at the end of 1895 was estimated to be approximately 433,843 acres. About 200,000 acres are under cultivation.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of steamers, which ply three times a week, and the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Codrington, in the south-western part of the island, a distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Coppermine line, from the junction at St. Joseph, 24½ miles from Port of Spain was opened in 1881.

An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Caroni Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and to Princes Town in 1884, and further extensions which will open up communication with the interior of the island and the east coast in course of construction. There are also 7½ miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savanna Grande. The total length of railway open is about 60 miles, all constructed and paid for by the Government. The total receipts from railways during 1895 were £64,289l., and the expenditure was £39,985l. This last amount included the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund, which in 1895 amounted to £2,500.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and about 15 offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, thence, via the United States, with Europe. Internal telegraphs now comprise 137 miles constructed by the Government. The revenue in 1895 were £699l., and the expenses £1,239l.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 34 per month, and comprised the following lines, besides some transient steamers:—Harrison Line, West India and Pacific, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique.
TRINIDAD.

London Direct Line, Oriental, Canadian, Quebec and Gulf Line, Oriental and Brad Bolivar, Orinoco Line, New York and Co., subsidy steamers, The Royal Mail. It is worthy of note that the steamers of Compagnie Transatlantique are as a rule of greater size than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and no difficulty in entering the port. The communication with the neighbouring Republic of Venezuela averages for the year over 16 letters per month. A fortnightly service to New York has been started by a local firm. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these persons. The rates of postage are as follows per letter:

Within Colony ........................................... 1
To any country beyond sea ......................... 2½

Coolie Immigration.

Migration from India is conducted under government control. Under this head £5,377 was expended by the Government in 1895, including 3,000 (Statute adults) immigrants. Numbers introduced in 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1894 respectively were 2,179, 3,263, 2,915, 1,940, and 2,519.

The amount remitted to India during 1894 by Indian immigrants was £11,663 0 0

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, and bronze, United States gold currency, and doubleboons. These are all legal tender, as is British gold, which is not often met with. Notes are kept in sterling by the Government, in dollars by the public. The notes of the Bank circulate to the extent of 105,000£.

There is no Colonial coinage or note issue. There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank has a branch at Port of Spain. Government savings banks are established in districts. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1895 was £94,430. They are under the management of the Receiver-General and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer rifle corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879. A volunteer artillery corps at Port of Spain, rifle corps at Naparima, Couva, Arima, San Fernando, and Arima, have been raised. Total of all local forces, 615.

The police force consists of 517 officers and men.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and entirely paid for by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic institution, St. Mary's College. Attached to these institutions are four exhibitions or scholarships of annual value of £50 each, tenable for three years at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of 1895—79 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, and 170 on those of St. Mary's College.

The primary schools are now 187 in number, 61 of which are secular schools supported entirely by Government, and 126 denominational and assisted. Fees are exacted, the rate being twopence per head per week, and at the Model Schools and two assisted schools five shillings per month.

In connection with the Model Schools there are Training Colleges for male and female teachers, which admit twelve resident and seven non-resident students. The Government schools in 1895 had 6,984 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 14,911.

Besides the public schools of which mention has been made above, there are many private adventure schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for girls. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad is shown to be 21,895.

Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of seven members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 9 official, and 11 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.
