TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 50 miles, and its average breadth 37½ miles, and its area is 1,862 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cédula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago at the census of 1921 was 365,913. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 121,233. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of five members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted by Letters Patent and an Order in Council which came into operation on 21st August, 1924. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and not more than nine other official members, and of not more than six nominated unofficial members and seven elected members. Trinidad is divided into six electoral districts, each returning one member. Tobago forms the seventh electoral district.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern was, up to the 30th June, 1921, carried on by the Government as a business administration. On 1st July, 1921, the administration was dissolved, and the Dock and Workshops placed under the control of the Public Works Department. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 65 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1923.

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Cocoa    | 74,096,341 lbs. | 1,419,499 |
| Sugar    | 35,523 tons     | 1,113,319 |

Sugar manufacture is mainly in the hands of a few large companies, which have improved the efficiency of their factories by the investment of part of the profits made during the short period of prosperity. The times are not favourable for the investment of any large amount of new capital.

Coconut cultivation is still extending, and recently planted areas will soon be in bearing. The great fall in price, to below pre-war times, has however given a check to this industry also.

The minerals at present worked are chiefly asphalt, and petroleum.

Asphalt.—An asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the Ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain. It is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of 10,000£., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease was for 21 years from 1st January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from 1st February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of 4,000£. a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from asphalt (the greater part of which came from the Lake) in 1923 was 72,436£.

Petroleum.—At the close of 1922 there were seventeen Companies engaged in the production of oil in the Colony. The number of wells drilled during the year was 108, bringing the total number drilled at 31st December, 1923, to 818, of which 520 are on Crown Lands. The Royalty paid by operating Companies on oil won from Crown Lands during 1923 amounted to 24,845£., as against 19,542£. in 1922.

The quantity of oil extracted during 1923 was 106,780,531 imperial gallons, an increase of 21,214,228 gallons as compared with 1922. The quantity exported amounted to 85,136,457 gallons valued at 1,223,137£., as against 56,403,395 gallons valued at 767,026£., exported in 1922. The principal Oil Companies engaged in the winning of Oil are the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Petroleum Development Company, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease; the United Brine Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, partly from their own and partly from Crown Lands; the Trinidias Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown Lands held under lease and from private lands at Barrackpore; the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaquite; the Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and Private Lands at Fyzabad; and the Kern (Trinidad) Oilfields Limited, from private lands at Guapo. There are still large areas of Crown Lands held under lease by the Trinidad Petroleum Development Company Limited, and the Trinidad Central Oilfields Limited. When the geological surveys have been completed certain portions of these areas will be taken up under lease, and the remainder will revert to the Crown. The total area of Crown Lands held by Companies under lease, prospecting and exploration licences aggregates some 573,35 acres. Four important refineries are engaged in the manufacture of oil fuel, petrol, and kerosene, while a few small topping plants produce petrol distillate and residual oils.

The fruit trade has not developed as was hoped. Commencing in 1905-6, when 4,259£. worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom, in 1916 it had increased to 19,252£. It decreased to 938£. in 1918 due to a lack of shipping facilities consequent on the war. The value of Fruit exports in 1923 was £1,031. The prospects of the bananas and rubber cultivations, which have been taken up in recent years, are very encouraging.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. About one-third, one-fifth and one-fifth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States of America respectively.

The following table gives the direction of the import trade for the last five years.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The mean temperature for the year was 79° and the rainfall 70°24 inches.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1921, 61,580), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1915, 24 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 5,130 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.
By Ordinance No. 24 of 1914, Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city, and its powers and duties were further extended by Ordinances Nos. 25 and 28 of 1914, and No. 36 of 1918. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1921 was 10,610.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1921 census, 4,210). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1923, was 160,645£., the expenditure, 138,415£., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was 312,949£. on the 31st December, 1923. This includes the loan of 84,000£. for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,262,833 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1923, was estimated to be approximately 685,259 acres. About 541,682 acres are under cultivation; 577,574 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly Coastal Steamship Service between Trinidad and Tobago by the Steamer "Belize," going every alternative week by the northern and southern routes, and calling at all the principal ports, this Service was previously run by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Limited, but in March, 1923, the Government purchased the s.s. "Belize," and is running the Service through local Agents (Alston & Co.).

The Government also own two small steamers one of which maintains communication to the island resorts between Port of Spain and the Bocas, including the prison establishments and the lighthouse. The other (run in connection with the Railway) makes two trips a week between San Fernando and La Brea (near the celebrated Pitch Lake), the Oilfields, Cedros, and to the south-western point of the island at Icacos, stopping at eight intermediate places along the coast, and carrying passengers and goods.

The railway was commenced by a line between Port of Spain and Arima, 16 miles, opened in 1876, and by subsequent extensions the railway system now consists of the Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast. The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.

The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabagueite in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction (14½ miles from Port of Spain) and running in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.

The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Marabella Junction (33 miles from Port of Spain) and running in an easterly direction to Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and

The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town, which, with branches (13 miles), was merged into the railway system in 1912.

The line between Port of Spain and St. Joseph (7½ miles) has been doubled.

The total length of this system is now 123 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 9 trains daily each way.

The railway stations are in telegraphic communication one with the other on all parts of the system open to the public, and there is a telephone line south-west of San Fernando along the steamer route, giving a total length of about 127 miles of telegraph and about 116 miles of telephone lines.

The total receipts from the railways, railway-steamers, telegraphs and telephones for the year 1923 amounted to 186,062£., and the working expenses to 215,260£., exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to 95,239£. The high cost of fuel is responsible for the increased expenditure, but the engines are being adapted to burn oil fuel and a considerable saving will in future be made.

The total number of passengers carried during 1923 was 1,306,062. The total tonnage of goods (including canes, 49,700 tons) was 243,030 tons.

There are numerous motor bus services plying along the Eastern Main Road between Port of Spain and Arima, and along the Southern Main Road between Port of Spain and San Fernando. These services are not continuous, individual owners plying for hire along different sections of the routes.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and 109 out-offices throughout the Colony.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 127 miles, constructed by the Government.

The wireless telegraph system, established in 1906 to bring Tobago into telegraphic communication with Trinidad, gave satisfactory results during the year 1923.

Wireless communication with British Guiana has been satisfactorily established, and during cable interruptions all traffic between Trinidad and British Guiana is dealt with by the Port of Spain wireless station.

Steamers calling at Trinidad comprised the following lines, besides a number of steamers calling for bunker coal, oil and orders:—Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, La Veloce (Navigazione Italiana), Trinidad Line (Furness Withy and Co., Ltd.), Lamport and Holt, Prince Line, Cia Anonima Venezolana de Navigacion Transatlantica Italiana, Royal Netherlands West India Mail, Canadian
Government Merchant Marine, and Clyde Steamship Line. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

- Within Colony ... ... ... 1½d.
- To U.K., India and British Colonies, also U.S.A. ... ... ... 2d.
- To other places, for 1st oz. ... ... ... 3d.
- and for each additional oz. ... ... ... 1½d.

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government and in dollars by the public, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance providing for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, the total value in circulation at 31st December, 1923, amounting to 147,290L.

Government Savings Banks are established in 25 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1923, was 29,415, with deposits amounting to 382,281L. The savings banks are largely used by the East Indians, of whom at the 31st December, there were 10,451 depositors with 133,848L. to their credit.

The Private Banks are the Colonial Bank, paid up capital 900,000L. with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at 260,000L.; the Royal Bank of Canada, paid up capital 4,250,000L. with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of 312,500L.; Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company Limited, paid up capital of 800,000L.; and the Canadian Bank of Commerce, paid up capital 3,125,000L. with an authorized note circulation of 9750,000L. In addition to engaging in banking business of every character, the Colonial Bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have savings bank branches and pay the same rate of interest as is paid by the Government Savings Bank, viz. 3 per cent.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institutions, St. Mary's College and the Convent School in Port of Spain, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the three latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are two scholarships of 700L. which are granted annually at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire, one being confined to agricultural Science.

There were—at the end of December, 1923—215 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 386 on those of St. Mary's College, 119 at the Naparima College, and 410 at St. Joseph Convent School.

The elementary schools are now 293 in number, 49 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by the Government, and 244 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and two assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are two Government and four denominational colleges for teachers, in which 28 students are trained. The Government schools in 1923 had 9,866 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 48,069.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 58,000, with an average daily attendance of about 33,000. The teaching of practical agriculture is now part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools in the Colony. 229 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1923.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institute for the instruction of the blind.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498; at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1589, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampe procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Rijn in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.
In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Situation and Area.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,213 acres, of which about 33,000 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1921 was 23,378 according to census.

General Description.

Cocoa, coconuts, copra and live stock form the principal articles of export, and the cultivation of the first two is still being extended. But little sugar is now produced. Vegetables, poultry, eggs and fruit are produced in considerable quantities, and find ready sale in the Trinidad markets to which in 1923 26,178L worth were exported. Exports from Tobago for the year ending 31st December, 1923, were valued at 77,323£.

| Principal items— | £ |
|-----------------|---|
| Cocoa           | 28,734 |
| Coconuts        | 763   |
| Copra           | 21,648 |
| Other Products  | 28,178 |

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1921, of 773. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of a coastal steamer, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represents Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.
