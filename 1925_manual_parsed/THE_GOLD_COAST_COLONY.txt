THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast Colony, with Ashanti, the Protected Northern Territories, and the British mandated territory of Togoland, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, between 3° 7' W. long. and 1° 14' E. long., and is bounded on the west by the French colony of the Ivory Coast, on the east by the French mandated territory of Togoland, on the north by the French Soudan, and on the south by the sea.

The area of the Colony is 23,490 square miles, of Ashanti, 24,560, of the Northern Territories, 30,600, and of the British mandated territory of Togoland, 13,040.

The Colony is inhabited by a large number of native tribes, whose customs and forms of government are of a more or less similar character. Each tribe has its own head chief and every town or village of the tribe a chief or headman.

The head chiefs and chiefs form the council of the tribe, and assist in dealing with matters affecting its general welfare. The succession to the chiefs' stools is for the most part hereditary by the female side, the heir to the stool being the son of the occupant's eldest sister, or failing male offspring by his sisters, his brothers according to seniority, and back from them to the male offspring of his aunts on the father's side.

The principal sea coast tribes are the following:—Apollonia, Ahanta, Chamah, Commendah, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winnebah, Assin Gomoa, Ga, Adangme, Awusa, Agbosome and Asiao.

In the interior of the Colony the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wassaw, Sefwi, upper and lower Denkera, Tufel, Assen, Esikuma, Ajunako, Akim Abuakwa, and Akim Kotoku, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Shai and Ningo.

A number of different languages and dialects are spoken, the principal being, Twi, Fanti, Awusa and Ga; but the use of English is widespread.

For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into three provinces, each presided over by a Provincial Commissioner. These Provinces are further divided into districts, presided over by District Commissioners. Most of these Officers perform judicial duties as magistrates in addition to being in administrative charge of their districts. The districts are as follows:

1. Western province:—Districts—Axim, Ankobra, Tarquah, Sekondi-Dixcove, Sefwi and Aowin.
2. Central province:—Districts—Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winnebah, Western Akim.
3. Eastern province:—Districts—Accra, Birrim, Akwapim, Volta River, Addah-Quitah.

History.

It is said that as early as the reign of Edward I. (1272-1307) English navigators made voyages to the Gold Coast, and that a hundred years later French adventurers reached the coast, who, about 1364, built several lodges or forts, one being at Elmina, parts of which are supposed to have been subsequently incorporated in the present castle there. No definite evidence however exists to support these claims, although it is quite possible

they are both correct; indeed, the natives until quite recently used to point out a hill near Takoradi as the site of a French fort built there many years ago. For our earliest knowledge of the Gold Coast we are indebted to the Portuguese navigators of the later years of the 14th and first part of the 15th centuries. They had been slowly extending their voyages down the West Coast of Africa, and it is recorded that in 1471 Juan de Santerem and Pedro d'Escoobar traded for gold in the neighbourhood of Elmina or Chama. They made the first European settlement eleven years later, when an expedition under Diego d'Azebujia built and garrisoned the fort San Jorge da Mine (Elmina), the materials for which he brought with him from Portugal. Several other settlements were founded, and the country was claimed for the King of Portugal by virtue of a Papal Bull granted in 1430, which gave to Portugal all the islands already discovered and all future discoveries in Guinea. This Bull was confirmed a few years after the foundation of Elmina by Pope Sextus IV. The Portuguese remained in undisputed possession for over fifty years until British merchant adventurers commenced trading on the coast, the earliest voyages of which records remain being those of Thomas Windham and Antonio Anes Pintado, in 1553, John Lok, in 1554, and William Townson, in 1556, 1566 and 1588. The British made no settlements at this time and their trade soon lapsed altogether until the early years of the 17th century. The Dutch, however, who made their first appearance on the coast in 1595, rapidly became serious rivals of the Portuguese and practically terminated their occupation by capturing Elmina in 1637, and Fort St. Anthony at Axim in 1642. After the activities of the Elizabethan sailors and merchant companies had come to an end, the English connection with the Gold Coast was revived by the efforts of a series of merchant companies, the first of which, called the "Company of Adventurers of London trading into Africa" was founded in 1618, but did not enjoy a successful career. Another company was formed in 1631, which established the first British fort on the coast at Kormantin, and lodges at several other places. This company was engaged in the slave trade, as were also the other European nations. Its charter was renewed in 1651, but in 1662 a new company was incorporated as the "Company of Royal Adventurers of England trading to Africa." Settlements were formed at Anamabu, Accra, and at Cabo Corso (Cape Coast), at which place the castle was built about this time by the English, although the Portuguese probably had a lodge there earlier. Three other European nations succeeded in acquiring territories on the Gold Coast, viz.:—The Swedes, the Brandenburgers, and the Danes. The first-mentioned built the fort of Christiansborg, near Accra about 1645, but were driven out by the Danes in 1657, and retired from the Coast. The Brandenburgers established "Fort Great Fredericksburg" at Princes River in 1682, and "Fort Dorothea" at Akwida in 1685, but their enterprise does not seem to have been prosecuted with much vigour, and was finally abandoned in 1720, their possessions falling into the hands of the Dutch. The Danes, however, after first selling the Fort at Christiansborg to the Portuguese, and re-buying it three years later, rapidly improved their position, building forts at several stations to the East of Accra, as far as Addah and Quittah, and exercising a kind of Protectorate over Akwapim, and the Volta River district.

The third English Company was not successful. The Dutch traders spared no efforts to get rid of their rivals, and in consequence of their aggression, an expedition was sent by Charles II. in 1664, under the command of Captain Holmes, which recaptured Cape Coast, taken the previous year by the Dutch, and all the other Dutch forts, with the exception of Elmina and possibly Axim. In the following year, however, the Dutch Commander de Ruyter recaptured all the lost Dutch forts, with the exception of Cape Coast; and the treaty of Breda, 1667, left affairs in the Gold Coast in this condition. The fourth English Company was incorporated in the year 1672 under the name of the "Royal African Company of England." Under its influence English interests steadily advanced, and forts were established at Dixovo, Sekondi, Commenda, Anamabu, Tarkwumkere, Winneba, Accra. The abolition of the exclusive privileges which the Royal African Company enjoyed, led to its decline and eventual dissolution in 1752. By the Acts of Parliament 23 George II., c. 31, and 25 George II., c. 40, a fifth trading Corporation, called the "African Company of Merchants" was formed, the membership of which was open to all British traders on payment of a fee of 40/-, compensation being paid for its charter and property to the Royal African Company. An annual subsidy was granted by Parliament to the newly-formed Company, until 1821, when by the Act 1 & 2 George IV., c. 28, the Company was dissolved and its possessions vested in the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlement, the seat of government being at Sierra Leone.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Insamankow, where, on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed. The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Accra, in 1826. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831, between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.

In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only 4000/- a year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his Government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the slave trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieutenant-Governor appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of native affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

Hitherto the forts of the various nations were intermixed with each other, and there was no defined limit as to where the influence of one or the other began or ended. The imposition of Customs duties was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by the existence of the free ports of a rival nation.
within a stone's throw, as it were, of the duty ports. On the 24th of January, 1850, by Letters Patent, the Settlements on the Gold Coast ceased to be dependencies of Sierra Leone, and in the same year, by the purchase of the forts and protectorate of the Danes, the Coast line from Christiansborg to Quittah and the districts of Shai, eastern and western Krobo, Akwapim, Akwamu, and Krepi, were acquired by England. By a Commission dated the 19th February, 1866, the Gold Coast Settlements were reunited to the Colony of Sierra Leone under one Governor-in-Chief. In 1867, a convention was made with the Dutch by which the portion of the Coast lying to the west of the Sweet River, which flows into the sea between Cape Coast and Elmina, was allotted to Holland, England taking all the territory to the east of the river, and a customs union between the two nations was established. The Dutch, however, found many difficulties in the way of their occupation of the forts and possessions received from the English in exchange for those of their own lying to the East of the boundary line. The native tribes refused to recognise their authority, and the prospect before them was that of a long series of petty wars with no reasonable hope of profit to be gained in the future. The result was the convention made between England and Holland in 1871, by which the Dutch transferred all their forts and possessions on the Coast to the English, and Great Britain obtained at last the sole sovereignty and control of the territory from Half-Assinie to Aflao. The forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872. The present extent and limits of the colony are defined in the Order in Council of 1906.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by Letters Patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Four unofficial members were appointed to the Legislative Council.

By Royal Instructions dated 20th September, 1916, under Letters Patent of the same date, all previous Instructions were revoked and the Executive and Legislative Councils were re-constituted. The Executive Council now consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Treasurer, the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, with the Governor as President. The Legislative Council consists of the members of the Executive Council and, in addition, the Comptroller of Customs, the Director of Public Works, the General Manager of Railways, and the Commissioners of the Eastern, Central and Western Provinces, as ex officio members, and such unofficial members as may be appointed by the Crown. At present there are nine unofficial members, viz., three European, three Paramount Chiefs, and three other members of the native community.

**Municipal Government.**

The Municipal Corporations Ordinance passed in 1924 provides for elected municipal councils and abolishes the official majority which was a feature of former municipal councils. This law comes into operation when applied to a particular municipality by Order-in-Council.

**Law and Justice.**

The Law of the Colony is the Common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England, on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed at various periods since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Ordinance passed in 1876.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court presided over by the Chief Justice, Divisional Courts held in different parts of the colony by five puisne judges, and some twenty-five inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction, of which four are presided over by Police Magistrates and the remainder by District Commissioners. The Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and decides appeals from the inferior courts in civil matters, while the Chief Justice and judges in their respective provinces have powers of revision of the decisions of the Magistrates and Commissioners in criminal cases. Appeals from Divisional Courts are heard by a full court.

Native law is administered in all the Courts, in so far as it is not incompatible with any Statute or Ordinance, and not repugnant to natural justice.

As between natives of the Colony, recognised Native Tribunals have a limited criminal and a limited exclusive civil jurisdiction in cases where all parties are natives of the Gold Coast Colony, Ashanti or the Northern Territories.

There is an appeal from Native Tribunals to the District Commissioner's Court, but where the title to land is in dispute a District Commissioner's Court is presided over by a Provincial Commissioner.

**Prisons.**

There is a Central Prison at Sekondi, especially constructed for long-sentence convicts; while Usher Fort, Accra, is also adapted for the same purpose. Next in importance are James Fort Prison, Accra, and the prisons at Coomassie and at Cape Coast (a portion of Cape Coast Castle, adapted as a prison). Local prisons also exist at most of the district headquarter stations, some being specially built prisons on a small scale, others being old forts adapted.

At Accra and Sekondi convicts are taught trades, and remunerative industries are carried on. Convicts with sentences of two years or over are placed on the marks system.

**Climate.**

The climate, though hot and damp, is cooler than that of most tropical countries situated in similar latitudes. It is not in itself unhealthy; but the prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases demands the taking of all possible precautions. The exact death rate among the non-official European population is difficult to ascertain, but the rate per 1,000 is believed to have been 12·3 in the financial year 1923-24. Among the European
officials the death rate per 1,000 was 6·1 during the same period. No data are at hand for estimating the death rate among the natives. Infant mortality is great. The rainfall varies with the physical configuration of the country, and is very great in Axim and the mining districts of Tarquah, Upper and Lower Wassaw, etc. The rainy season is irregular and not clearly defined, but it may perhaps be said that the "first rains" begin in March and end in July; the "latter rains" are spread over the months of September and October. The rainy season is marked by a considerable fall in temperature, which is found to be refreshing to many Europeans, but proves trying to some. The Harmattan season begins in December and ends in February. It is characterised by a cool wind which is dry and bracing.

The maximum shade temperature in 1923 was—At Accra 86·3° F., at Sekondi 87·6°, at Coomassie 88·3°, and at Tamale 93·3°. The rainfall in inches at those towns in 1923, was 21·16, 39·29, 55·75, and 36·03 respectively.

Local Agents:—The Swiss African Trading Company.

Harbours.

The Gold Coast has always been at a great disadvantage, in that it possesses no deep water harbour. Jetties have been built at Sekondi, but owing to the continuous silting up of the harbour they cannot be used to their full capacity. At Accra a breakwater and jetty have also been constructed, but here again the silting difficulty prevents the use of anything except surf boats.

A harbour is now in course of construction at Takoradi, near Sekondi, which will provide still-water anchorage close to the shore, and berths alongside for three ships. The scheme admits of future extensions whereby three more berths (and, if necessary, another pier with eight berths) could be provided.

Internal Communications.

Railway communication now consists of the Sekondi-Kumasi line (167 miles), with branches Tarkwa to Preetae, Akym to Insuta and Inchaban Junction to Inchaban (Sekondi) Water Works, and the Accra-Kumasi line (196 miles). All these lines are 3' 6" gauge. There is a branch line Accra to Weshiang (Accra Water Works) which is only 2' 6" gauge.

A line is being constructed starting from Huni Valley on the Sekondi-Kumasi line and running eastward through the Central Province of the Colony to the neighbourhood of Kade, a distance of approximately 120 miles.

In 1921, the railway revenue was 706,107£, and the working expenditure 455,249£. The total number of miles open for traffic at the end of 1921 was 302, and the capital cost 6,061,192£. 1,268 miles of roads are maintained by the Department of Public Works:—
In the Eastern Province and Togoland, 326 miles.
In the Central Province, 305½ miles.
In the Western Province, 160 miles.
In Ashanti, 144 miles.
In the Northern Territories, 332½ miles.

In addition there are a large number of roads which have been constructed and are maintained by the Chiefs, and can be used by motors at any rate during the dry weather. Where rivers and swamps have to be crossed, ferries have been instituted which are controlled for the most part by the Chiefs, who are empowered to levy a small fee. In some cases, where this arrangement has not given satisfaction, ferries are worked under direct Government supervision.

The principal waterway is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains, and flows into the sea at Addah, after a course of 200 miles. It is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse, and, with the exception of the Krachi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. The Ankobra River has been largely used for transport purposes to the mines in the Prestea and Himan Districts, and is navigable for many months of the year by surf-boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assinie, by the main lagoon, and by a tramway, three miles in length, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tanoso, a distance of about 60 miles. Rapids at Sutri prevent this river being further utilised.

The Government maintains a Motor Transport Service, consisting of 37 cars and lorries, including reserves, capable of instant expansion when necessary. At present it operates only in centres where vehicles provided by private enterprise are unobtainable or more costly than a Government owned fleet. The headquarters is at Accra, with branches at Sekondi, Kumasi, and Ho. The department also handles Government cargo arriving by sea and arranges the coastwise shipping of Government personnel and stores between ports within the Colony.

Medical Facilities.

European medical attendance can be obtained at the principal centres of the Colony and Southern Ashanti. In many places where no medical officer is stationed, village dispensaries under the supervision of a neighbouring medical officer have been established.

A large and up-to-date hospital has been recently opened at Accra.

Sanitation.

There is a Sanitation Department under the control of the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, which hitherto confined its attention to chiefly Kumasi and the leading ports, though all Medical Officers at outstations are charged also with duties concerning public health. A vigorous anti-mosquito campaign is waged by this Department.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails exchanged fortnightly between the Colony and other British Colonies on the West Coast and the United Kingdom are carried by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and of the African Steamship Company. Mails are exchanged overland with the French sphere of Togoland and with the French Ivory Coast.

There are 49 post offices and 119 postal agencies, the distribution being effected principally by rail and motor. When this is impossible a runner service is employed. The rate for letter (1 oz.) within the Empire is 1d., to the United States of America, 1½d., elsewhere, 3d.

There are 4,209 miles of telegraph line serving all the principal centres. The rate is 1/- for 12 words, and 1d. word in excess of 12.

Public telephone exchanges, connected by a trunk telephone system, are installed at Accra, Cape Coast, Dodowa, Dunkwa, Huni Valley, Koforidua, Kumasi, Nassaw, Sekondi, Tarkwa and Winneba. There are about 750 subscribers (including Government offices). Further extensions to the telephone system are in progress.

Parcel post despatches are exchanged direct with the United Kingdom and with other British Colonies in West Africa. Parcels for other countries are forwarded through the United Kingdom.

British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid in the Colony, and both an inland and a foreign Money Order system is in operation.

A coastal radiotelegraph station at Accra transmits radiotelegrams at 9½d. per word.

The African Direct Telegraph Company transmits messages by cable to any part of the world from Accra and Sekondi.

Education.

Primary education is provided by the Government schools and by the African Methodists Episcopal Zion, the Church of England (S.P.G.), the Roman Catholic, the Wesleyan and the Scottish Missions. Mission schools receive assistance from Government if they reach certain definite standards laid down regarding curriculum, average attendance, etc. There are many mission schools in addition to the above which cater to the needs of the smaller communities in more distant places and are unable to qualify for the grant. Industrial instruction, chiefly agricultural in character, is given in most primary schools. The average number of children attending Government and assisted schools is close upon 30,000.

With a few exceptions the primary schools are mixed, boys and girls working side by side in all the standards. In practice however the proportion of girls in the higher standards is small owing to the fact that they seldom complete the full term of their school career.

The Government schools are administered on principles similar to those of the Boy Scouts' and Girl Guides' Associations, and all Government school children are encouraged, though not compelled, to enrol themselves as members of these bodies.

There are two institutions for the training of teachers, namely, the Scottish Mission Seminary at Akropong and the Government Training College at Accra. At the latter institution students are trained for all Government and assisted schools except those belonging to the Scottish Mission. The staff of the Accra Training College consists of the acting principal, one housemaster, three assistant masters and three African teachers. Accommodation is provided for 120 students and the course is for three years.

The Government Technical School in Accra was established in 1909. The staff consists of the
Principal, housemaster, three European masters and four African instructors. This school is equipped for the teaching of:

(a) Metal-work (theoretical and practical), comprising fitting, motor engineering, blacksmith's work, and mechanical drawing;

(b) Wood-work (theoretical and practical), comprising carpentry, joinery, cabinet-making, polishing and mechanical drawing.

Further opportunity of becoming proficient in wood and metal working is provided by the Public Works Department in whose new workshops, opened in 1923, up-to-date machinery has been installed.

A limited number of pupils are taught masonry. The pupils at this school are paid apprentices and are under bond to complete the course of instruction at the school for three years and afterwards to serve in the Public Works Department for a period of two years, if required.

Four junior trade schools have now been established by Government at Kibbi in Eastern Akim, Assuanti in the Cape Coast District, Mampong in Ashanti and Yendi in the Northern Territories. The staff in these schools consists of European headmasters and African instructors in literary subjects, carpentry, masonry and agriculture and metal work.

The only assisted secondary school in the Colony is the Church of England (S.P.G.) grammar school at Cape Coast. A Government secondary school is to be established at Achimota about six miles distant from Accra. It is hoped that it will be opened in 1926.

Currency and Banking.

Prior to 1912 and 1913 the currency consisted chiefly of British gold (comparatively rare), silver and copper. In 1912, subsidiary nickel-bronze coins (½d., ¼d. and ⅛d. pieces) were introduced, and in 1913 a special silver currency common to all the British West African Colonies of the same weight and fineness as the corresponding British coins. The coins so far issued are 2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d. pieces. Owing to the great increase in the demand for currency and the difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies, it was found necessary in 1915 to make British Treasury Notes legal tender, and in 1916 special West African Currency Notes were introduced. 20s. and 10s. Notes are the only values now in circulation, ½s., 2s. and 1s. Notes having been withdrawn. In 1920, owing to the rapid disappearance of silver coins, an alloy coinage was introduced of the same denominations as the silver coins and silver has now practically been withdrawn from circulation. The special West Africa silver and alloy currency and the West African Currency Notes are under the management of the West African Currency Board and are secured by sterling securities held by the Board. Current British gold and silver coins, British 20s. and 10s. Treasury Notes, West Africa Currency silver and alloy coins, West African Currency Notes, and West Africa nickel-bronze coins are all legal tender.

The Bank of British West Africa, Limited, opened at Accra on the 1st January, 1897, and now has branches at all the principal business centres in the Colony.

The Colonial Bank began business at Accra in 1917, and branches have now been opened at other centres. Both Banks have a savings department. In 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established which is now under Post Office management. On 31st March, 1923, the amount to the credit of depositors was £5,284l.

Accounts are kept in sterling.

Population.

The first attempt to take a census was made in 1891 which, however, covered the Colony only. Since then a census has been made at ten-year intervals, viz.:—1901, 1911 and 1921. Except in 1901, the whole of Ashanti and the Northern Territories have been included. In a country such as the Gold Coast, imperfect communications and lack of education make the holding of a complete census a matter of great difficulty and even now the figures cannot be considered absolutely accurate.

The resident population on census day, 1921, was as follows:—

|                |        |
|----------------|--------|
| The Colony     | 1,173,439 |
| Ashanti       | 406,594 |
| Northern Territories | 530,391 |

Total: 2,110,424

Of this total, 1,967 were non-Africans, the majority being British. The population of the British sphere of Togoland was 187,959, of whom 20 were non-Africans. The grand total therefore for the area administered by the Gold Coast Government was 2,298,383. There was also a maritime population of 1,528 in the various harbours on census day.

The African population of the chief towns was as follows:—

| Town          | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| Accra         | 38,049     |
| Kumasi        | 20,268     |
| Cape Coast    | 14,921     |
| Keta          | 9,859      |
| Sekondi       | 9,500      |
| Teshi         | 7,604      |
| Winneba       | 6,980      |
| Saltpond      | 6,342      |

Trade and Industries.

The chief products of the Colony are cocoa, gold and manganese. Palm oil, palm kernels, lumber, kola and copra are also shipped.

The cultivation of cocoa was started in Akwapim in 1879, and exports in 1891 realised £4l. Coffee at that time fetched a fair price, and it was not until 1898, when the price for the latter article fell so low as to make its cultivation at any distance from the coast unremunerative, that attention was paid to cocoa. Since that year the cocoa industry has made rapid strides. In 1900 the value exported was £27,280l., in 1918, £1,796,985l., and in 1920, £10,066,298l. In 1921, although the value fell considerably to £4,764,067l., the quantity of cocoa exported exceeded the 1920 export by 8,422 tons. In 1922 159,306 tons, valued at £5,840,743l. were exported. There is a tax of ½ of a penny per lb. on cocoa exported.

Gold has been exported from the Gold Coast more or less continuously since the discovery of the country by Europeans in the fifteenth century. Up to 1874, however, the industry was almost
entirely in the hands of the natives. The first company for gold mining in West Africa was founded in 1874, but did little beyond exploration. A second company, formed in 1879, engaged in mining operations in the neighbourhood of Tarquah, and from that year the progress of mining enterprise is indicated by the rapid increase in the exports of gold bars, the result of European operations, as compared with those of gold dust, the produce of native mining. In 1899 there was a very remarkable development of the mining industry, which, though checked for a while by the disturbances in Ashanti, received a fresh impetus from the passing of the Concessions Ordinance in 1900, the progress of the railway, and general improvement in means of transport.

Gold is widely diffused throughout the Colony, Ashanti, and some parts of the Northern Territories, in quartz and alluvial deposits, while in Wassaw there is good conglomerate or banket formation which is now reported to extend to the Birrim District in the Eastern Province. The rivers are said to be rich in alluvial deposits. From the year 1903 (the first in which reliable statistics of production were kept) to 1921, the gold produced in the colony and Ashanti amounted to 5,062,267 fine ozs., valued at 21,504,750L. The highest annual production was in 1914, viz.:—410,655 fine ozs., valued at 1,744,498L. In 1923 the value of gold and gold dust exported was 860,671L.

Bitumen is found along the banks of the river Bonni, in Apollonia and the stream Akyikyiri, flowing into the Ehi lagoon near Half Assinie. Manganese ore has been found near the railway line, 33 miles from Secondee, and this important ore is now being exported to England and America in considerable quantities. Extensive deposits of Bauxite exist, the most important being situated near Mpraeso in the Kwahu district where a large quantity of high grade ore has been located. In the Eastern Province near Kibbi diamonds have been found, and the alluvial is being worked. Small diamonds have also been found in other localities.

Manganese exists in large quantities close to the railway line within 40 miles of the port of Sekondi, and the shipments of this ore reached 136,603 tons in 1923. New machinery is being installed at the mines, which is expected to raise the capacity for output to between 360,000 and 400,000 tons per annum. With the provision of proper shipping facilities at the port of Takoradi, now under construction, manganese will improve its position as one of the Colony's most valuable exports.

The trade in products of the oil-palm has suffered severely in the last quarter of a century from the competition of cocoa, and except in certain localities, notably the Volta River District, the farming of this kind of produce is neglected. The potential wealth of the Gold Coast oil-palm, however, is great, and every encouragement is given to the chiefs to start new plantations.

13,657,318 lbs. of Kola were exported by sea during 1923, almost entirely to Nigeria. Kola is also exported overland in a northerly direction but statistics of this trade cannot be kept. The value of the export during 1923, was 319,806L., which places kola in a leading position among the products of the Gold Coast.

An experimental sisal hemp plantation was started by Government in 1920 near Accra for the purpose of demonstrating to the people scientific methods of cultivating and harvesting this plant in order to induce them to take up the industry. The first shipment, of about 10 tons, was made in October, 1924. The fibre is of good quality and can be prepared and shipped at present prices with a large margin of profit.

The values of the following exports for 1923 were:

| Item          | Value     |
|---------------|-----------|
| Cocoa         | £6,566,978|
| Raw Gold      | 860,671   |
| Manganese Ore | 327,377   |
| Kola Nuts     | 319,805   |
| Lumber        | 156,308   |
| Palm Kernels  | 57,299    |
| Palm Oil      | 37,773    |
| Copra         | 36,716    |
| Diamonds      | 10,942    |

The first in value of the imports in 1923 was cotton piece goods, followed by Railway Plant and rolling stock, but there is a steady demand for provisions, hardware, machinery, oils, motor spirits, flour, illuminating oils, building materials, cement and lime, soap, bags and sacks, spirits and malt liquors. The use of motor transport is rapidly extending in the colony; in 1923, the number of cars and lorries imported was 550.

Native manufactures are insignificant. Cloths are woven in many parts of the country, for the most part of English spun yarn, but in the northern districts occasionally of thread manufactured from the indigenous cotton plant. Narrow strips of four to six inches are woven on a rough hand loom, and stitched together to make clothes of various sizes. Gold and brass are worked by native smiths; canoes are made on the coast rivers; pottery for domestic purposes is made by hand, and wood-carving is done chiefly in Ashanti and Kwahu. Salt is roughly prepared from the lagoons between Accra and Quittah, and sent up country to the markets of the Northern Territories. Fishing is extensively carried on along the coast, and large quantities of sun-dried fish are sent to the villages and markets of the interior.

ASHANTI.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwaiis, Adansis, Kokofus, Nkwantas, Kumasis, Agunas, Mampons, Neutas, Kumawus, Bompatas, Juabins and Jius. Each tribe has its own Head Chief, but from time immemorial the King of Kumasi was recognised as the King paramount of the Confederation.

In 1873 the King of Ashanti invaded the British Protectorate with a large army, and reached Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the British forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing. Later in the year Captain (afterwards Sir) John Glover was sent to the eastern districts of the Protectorate to organise the tribes in that quarter, for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, (afterwards Viscount) Wolseley was despatched to the Gold Coast, with British and West Indian troops, native levies, and some seamen and marines, to operate against the Ashantis, starting from Cape Coast. On the 31st of January, 1874, he came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoafu, where he drove them from their position after desperate resistance. The next four days were
employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Kumasi. The King had fled to the bush. A few days later Sir John Glover also reached Kumasi. On the 13th, messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fommanah, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fommanah, the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold.

In 1894 Prempeh, who was then King of Kumasi, and had successfully fought against the Nkoranzas, who had revolted against his rule, threatened to attack the Atabubus. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Kumasi. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and a military expedition accordingly proceeded to Kumasi, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Kumasi without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmina Castle, whence he was eventually deported to the Seychelles. A Resident was at the same time installed at Kumasi, and thus commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

In 1900 the Governor visited Kumasi, and was there besieged by the Ashantis, the town being closely invested. Provisions ran short, and a part of the garrison, with the Governor, cut their way out; the rest were relieved by Colonel (afterwards Sir J.) Willcocks, commanding the Ashanti Field Force, on 15th July, after severe fighting. The Ashantis were subsequently thoroughly routed at Obessa.

An Order of the King in Council, dated September 26th, 1901, defined the boundaries of Ashanti, annexed it to His Majesty's Dominions, and provided for its administration under the Governor of the Gold Coast. Ashanti is under a Chief Commissioner, with Commissioners of Provinces and Districts under him. By a subsequent Order in Council of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Colony and Ashanti, and between Ashanti and the Northern Territories, were re-adjusted and defined, with due regard to tribal lands and natural features.

Ashanti is now divided into two provinces, the Eastern with headquarters at Kumasi and the Western with headquarters at Sunyani. Each of these is subdivided into districts under a District Commissioner who exercises limited jurisdiction; as does also a Police Magistrate in the town of Kumasi.

In 1919 a Circuit Judge was appointed for Ashanti. This officer relieves the Chief Commissioner of practically all judicial work except civil cases and matters in which native customary law is applicable.

The peaceful relations which, under the auspices of the Gold Coast Government, have existed for many years now between the Ashantis and the neighbouring tribes have been signified by not infrequent petitions emanating from the Gold Coast Colony as well as from Ashanti for the return from exile of Prempeh, the former Chie of Kumasi. The confidence felt by the Government of the Gold Coast in the loyalty of the Ashanti people has led to the grant of this request, and the banished monarch has returned to his native land.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES.

In 1897 the territories to the north of Ashanti were constituted a separate district with the title of "The Northern Territories," and placed in charge of a Commissioner, and a grant-in-aid of the expenditure in the Northern Territories was voted by Parliament.

Major H. P. Northcott was appointed Commissioner and Commandant of these territories, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The negotiations between the British and French Governments for the settlement of territorial questions in West Africa, which had been suspended in 1896, were resumed in October, 1897; and on 14th June, 1898, after a period of considerable tension in consequence of the proximity of the British and French forces in the disputed territories, a Convention was signed at Paris with a proviso that it should be ratified within six (subsequently extended to twelve) months. By this Convention the boundary between the Gold Coast and the French Colony of the Ivory Coast, which had only been settled in 1889, as far as the 9th parallel of north latitude, was continued northwards along the course of the Black Volta River to the 11th parallel, and it was then drawn along the 11th parallel with a deflection to the north in the neighbourhood of Mamprusi, until it met the Franco-German boundary of 1897.

The effect of the Anglo-French Convention of 14th June, 1898, was to leave Bona, Lobi, and Moshi to France, while Dagati, Wa, Mamprusi, and the southern portion of Grunshi were included in the British sphere.

On 14th November, 1899, an agreement was concluded with Germany for the partition of the "neutral zone." This partition assigned Salaga to Great Britain, and Yendi to Germany, and to the north of the zone gave Mamprusi to the former and Chakosi to the latter.

Survey operations were undertaken by Anglo-French and Anglo-German Commissions during 1901-2, for the delimitation of those portions of the boundaries which had not yet been settled.

By the demarcation on the ground of the Anglo-German boundary between the Trans-Volta District and the adjoining Colony of Togo; of the Anglo-German boundary north of the 9th parallel of north latitude; and of the Anglo-French boundary along the 11th parallel of north latitude, all the frontiers of the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories have now been exactly defined.

Provision was made for the administration of the Northern Territories under the Gold Coast Government by an Order of the King in Council of 26th September, 1901, and by an Administrative Ordinance of January 1st, 1902, the Northern Territories were placed under a Chief Commissioner, and divided into the White Volta, Black Volta, Kintampo and Gonja Districts with headquarters at Gambaga, Wa, Kintampo and Salaga. By proclamation of 27th June, 1921, the country was re-divided as follows—Northern Province, consisting of the districts of Northern Mamprussi, Southern Mamprussi, Lorha Tumu and Wa.
Southern Province, consisting of the districts of Eastern and Western Dagombe and Eastern and Western Gonja.

The Districts are presided over by Commissioners, who are responsible to the Chief Commissioner and have Courts of Justice, with appeal to the Chief Commissioner at Tamale.

By Order in Council, of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Northern Territories and Ashanti were re-adjusted and defined.

An important step was taken with regard to the Government of this Protectorate by replacing, with effect from the 1st of January, 1907, the former semi-military administration by a staff of Civil District and Assistant District Commissioners, and by establishing new stations. Simultaneously, the 2nd Battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment was disbanded, and a force of armed constabulary substituted therefor.

In 1920 the Circuit Judge, Ashanti, was appointed to exercise in the Northern Territories powers similar to those which he exercises in Ashanti.
