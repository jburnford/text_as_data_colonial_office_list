BRITISH HONDURAS.

Situation and Area.
British Honduras is a Colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the rapids of Gracias a Dios on the River Sarstoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier, on the south by Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18°29' and 15°54' N. latitude and 89°15' and 87°50' W. longitude.

The area of the Colony is 8,598 square miles, about the size of Wales, including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George's, English, Turneffe and other Cays (Islands), 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. It is estimated that about 155 square miles are under cultivation.

History.
The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers, who were attracted by the logwood which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were long at St. George's Cay. The name of the present chief town and of the River Belize is alleged to be a corruption of the name of the buccaneer Wallis, who was driven from Hispaniola in that year, and who is said to have been the leader of the settlers. The Spaniards frequently endeavoured to expel the logcutters; but, though they succeeded in driving them from the northern coast of Yucatan about 1717, they failed to dislodge them from the eastern coast.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito coast, in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers, and their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protec-

tion, and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain, and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Ruatan, and at Black River on the mainland. Ruatan was abandoned in 1749, but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements on the Mosquito Coast. As a result of the treaty of Paris in 1763, the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay," the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms. By the Treaty of Versailles of 1783, Spain recognised a district (within what is now British Honduras) within which the British logcutters might work without interference; and by the Convention of London signed in 1786, it was agreed that the British Colonists should evacuate the Mosquito Coast and the adjacent islands. In spite of these treaties, many of the settlers remained outside the agreed limits; and it was not until the treaties of 1869 with the Republic of Honduras and 1860 with Nicaragua that the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast were finally recognised as belonging to those States, Nicaragua agreeing to allow the Mosquito Indians autonomy in the Reserve which was assigned to them.

The only other events of external significance which need here be noticed, are the definition, as above, of the boundaries of the Colony (of which a survey has been partially executed); and the frequent border troubles, connected with the revolt in 1849 of the Indian population of Yucatan against the Spanish inhabitants, the result of which was that the Indians were in possession of the country to a considerable distance north of the Hondo until 1901, when the Mexicans subjugated them. Occasional incursions into the Colony were made from time to time by the Indians, the last being in 1872, by the Icaiohe tribe on the N.W. frontier.

Constitution.
The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1768 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790–1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1839 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted, consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on the 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, and a Legislative Council substituted therefor, consisting of five official, and not less
than four unofficial members, with the Lieutenant-Governor as President. Since 1913 the Council contains five official and seven unofficial members. On the 31st October, 1884, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica. These were renewed by Letters Patent proclaimed on the 16th September, 1909.

The English Common Law and all statutes of the Imperial Parliament "in abrogation or derogation in any way declaratory of the Common Law," passed before 1899 extend to the Colony as far as local circumstances render such extension suitable, and subject to modification by Colonial ordinances. Pursuant to Ordinance No. 9 of 1913, a revised edition of the Consolidated Laws has been published in two volumes. This edition came into force on the 14th January, 1915, and supersedes the edition published in 1887 and all Ordinances passed before June, 1914. Appeals to His Majesty in Council are regulated by Chapter 16 of the Consolidated Laws (Revised Edition).

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, and six members, three of whom are ex officio, the other three appointed members.

For administrative purposes the Colony is divided into six districts—Belize, which includes the capital at the mouth of the river of the same name; the Coroal district; the Orange Walk district; the Cayo district; the Stann Creek district; and the Toledo district, the main station of which is Punta Gorda.

General Description.

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached. The characteristic soils of the Colony are known as Cahoon ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), the Pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass), and Broken ridge (intermediate between these two). Besides these there are swamp, savannah, and mountain.

The chief rivers are in the north of the Colony, and run in a north-easterly direction, the Belize reaching the sea on the east, and the Hondo and the New River on the north.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscomb Mountains a height of some 4,000 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pasturage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. The soil generally was rich, but a few rugged spots were encountered. Some fine gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered, and other indications of minerals were noticed.

In 1888 Governor Sir R. Goldsworthy, with an exploring party, ascended the Cockscomb Mountains.

Industry.

The chief industry is wood-cutting, now over 200 years old, 10,006,007 superficial feet of mahogany, 685,927 superficial feet of cedar, were exported in 1923. The next in importance is fruit, the exports in 1923 having been 332,500 bunches bananas, 898,600 (number) plantains, and 5,694,706 coconuts. The Colony also exported 2,206,009 lbs. chicle, 2,707 lbs. tortoise shell, and 1,599 lbs. sponges.

Other exports 1923, 1,831,085 lbs. copra and 62 tons rosewood.

Alternating with stretches of sandy plain, yielding pine trees, are large areas of very rich land, on which, in addition to mahogany and many beautiful hard woods of which little or no use is made, the cahoon palm and vanilla orchid are most noticeable by reason of their abundance and the luxuriance with which they grow. The Colony has not yet been exploited by the economic botanist, otherwise these rich oil-bearing nuts and vanilla would certainly have been turned to profitable account instead of being allowed to go to waste. There is a wide field for the colonist with a little capital and a stock of perseverance and common sense.

Belize is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1923, 311 vessels, of 3,914 tons net.

The imports consist mainly of cotton goods and hardware, malt liquors, spirits, refined sugar, tea, tobacco, wines, provisions, and specie. The commercial intercourse is mainly with the United States, Great Britain and Canada.

Communications.

The easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is regular communication once a week alternately with New Orleans and Mobile, weekly with Puerto Barrios and Puerto Cortes, monthly with New York and with Liverpool and Colon. There is also a tri-weekly mail and passenger service by the Canadian Government Merchant Marine with Jamaica, Bermuda, Bahamas and Canada. The usual length of the journey between England and British Honduras is 16 days, via the United States and about 21 days via Jamaica. Telegraphic communication with Europe is maintained by a land line to Consejo on the Hondo River, which connects, by a cable across the Hondo, with the Mexican Telegraph System through Payo Obispo in Yucatan (1911), and by radio-telegraphic communication with New Orleans (1915).

A telegraph and telephone line has also been constructed from Belize to the most southerly town of Punta Gorda, and another from Belize to the Cayo. A Radio-telegraph Station is situated in Belize.

A short railway leads from the town of Stann Creek, 25 miles inland, the first section of which was opened towards the end of 1908, and the second section in March, 1909. The line was practically completed in 1910, but extraordinary floods in 1911 carried away a couple of bridges, and did other damage, which have been replaced.

Rates of Postage.

| Letters | Newspapers |

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 90°, the minimum 62°. The dew point in Belize, a seaport, is relatively high. Sea breezes prevail for the greater part of the year. The average rainfall during the past twenty years has been 31'48 inches per annum. From the middle of February to the middle of May is the dry season. For the rest of the year there is rain to some extent during every month, the heaviest rainfall being in the months of September, October and November, during which months about one-third of the total rain occurs.

Currency and Banking.

Up to the 14th October, 1894, the coins in circulation were principally South and Central American silver dollars; there was no paper currency. The standard of value was the Guatemalan dollar, and Chilian and Peruvian silver coins were also current and legal tender, as well as a colonial currency of one-cent pieces, at fixed ratings with the Guatemalan dollar. By Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, the currency has been established on a gold basis, the United States gold dollar being adopted as the standard coin. Gold coins of the United States Mint are legal tender for the amounts of their respective denominations in standard dollars; also the British sovereign and half-sovereign for the amounts of $4.867 and $2.433 respectively. There is a local subsidiary currency of 50 cent, 25 cent, 10 cent, and 5 cent silver pieces, and a Government note issue of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5 and 10 dollars; a nickel bronze 5 cent piece and a bronze cent piece are also current. The legal tender in silver is unlimited, and in nickel or bronze, 50 cents. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corozal, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda and the Cayo), had, on 31st March, 1924, $171,421.

On the 14th October, 1912, The Bank of British Honduras, Ltd., was bought over as a going concern by the Royal Bank of Canada. Banking business of every character is conducted.

Education.

The schools, both Secondary and Primary, are, with one or two exceptions, denominational. With few exceptions, all Primary schools are inspected and aided by the Colonial Government. Sixty-five received aid in 1923, to the extent of $51,583, with 6,774 scholars on the roll, and 5,800 average attendance. The total cost of Primary education for the year was $79,540.

The total number of pupils on the roll in all the schools was about 7,773, with an average attendance of 6,068.

A law "To provide for Compulsory Education in certain cases," was passed in January, 1915. It was intended chiefly for Indian towns and villages, but its scope has since been extended so as to include practically all school areas.

Population.

The population of the several Districts of the Colony, based on the census taken on the 24th April, 1921, was:

- Belize District ... ... ... 17,398

DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba) were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 255,285 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 251,700 square miles.

By Federal Act passed in the Session of 1912, the boundaries of the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba were extended. Ontario was enlarged by 146,400 square miles, Quebec by 354,961 and Manitoba by 178,100.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate now consists of 96 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 represent Ontario, 24 Quebec, 24 the Maritime Provinces, and 24 the Western Provinces. The qualification for Senate is the possession of property worth $4,000, age not less than thirty years, British nationality and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consists originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is at present 235; 82 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 16 Nova Scotia, 11 New Brunswick, 15 Manitoba, 13 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 12 Alberta, 16 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional
number according to their population at each decennial census. The Representation Act, 1924, provides for an increase in the total number of seats to 245, where the representation by provinces in the 16th Parliament will be—Prince Edward Island 4, Nova Scotia 14, New Brunswick 11, Quebec 65, Ontario 82, Manitoba 17, Saskatchewan 21, Alberta 16, British Columbia 14; Yukon 1. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $4,000 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $4,000 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council or Cabinet possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. The territory not comprised within any province (Yukon and the North-West Territories) is very thinly inhabited, and is governed by a Commissioner, a deputy Commissioner, and a Council of five appointed by the Governor in Council at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures. The Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, naturalisation, and Indian affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head. Each Province also received an annual allowance for Government.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whose public debts were less, proportionally, at the Union than that of the old Province of Canada became entitled to receive an interest allowance, payable half-yearly, on the difference between their respective debts and certain stipulated amounts.

The annual subsidies granted to the several provinces have been revised by Imperial enactment (1907), and are now as follows:

(a) A fixed grant according to population:
Where population is—
Under 150,000 ........................................... 100,000
150,000, but does not exceed 200,000 ........ 150,000
200,000 .................................................. 180,000
400,000 .................................................. 190,000
800,000 .................................................. 220,000
over 1,500,000 ............................................ 240,000

(b) A grant at the rate of 80 cents per head of the population of the province up to 2,500,000, and at the rate of 60 cents per head of so much of the population as exceeds that number.

(c) An additional grant of $100,000 yearly to the province of British Columbia for a period of ten years, from 1907.

In lieu of public lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which the Dominion retains, each province receives until its population reaches 400,000, an annual sum of $375,000, payable half-yearly; thereafter until the population reaches 800,000, an annual sum of $562,500; thereafter until the population reaches 1,200,000, $750,000; thereafter the sum payable shall be $1,125,000.

Each of these two provinces, inasmuch as they were not in debt at the time (1906) of their statutory creation, are entitled to be paid half-yearly, in advance, an annual sum of $406,375.

By chapter 32 of the Acts of the Parliament of Canada, 1912, the boundaries of the Province of Manitoba were extended northward to the 60th parallel of north latitude, and eastward to the shores of Hudson Bay, the area of the enlarged province as a result approximating the respective areas of the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In consequence of this enlargement allowances from the Federal Treasury practically identical in amount and upon the same basis as the allowances or grants to Alberta and Saskatchewan, as recited in the preceding paragraphs became payable to the Province of Manitoba.

By chapter 42 of the Acts of 1912, an additional annual grant of one hundred thousand dollars was made to the Province of Prince Edward Island.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland. Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises:

(a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 miles square (in the Prairie Provinces 6 miles square); (b) villages with a
population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute (d) the county municipality; (e) cities in the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 10,000 and 15,000 respectively. In the other provinces they are incorporated under certain Municipal Codes and Acts. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councillors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,729,665 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion (including territories added to the Provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba) comprise a little over 1,773,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands on the west.

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. "Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; 35 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 3,754 "homesteads" were granted in the calendar year 1923. In 1923 there were 2,982 butter and cheese factories and 25 factories producing condensed milk and cream. The value of land, buildings and plant was $39,120,207. The number of persons employed in factories during the year was 10,160, and the amount paid for salaries and wages was $9,936,414.

Canadian manufacturing has grown steadily to reach the stage indicated by the table which follows. The utilization of hydro-electric power in Ontario and Quebec, which lack coal, is an important phase of the recent development.

Canada, with an area of 3,729,665 square miles, and with numerous resources of field, forest, mine, water powers and fisheries, has long been an attractive field for immigration. As long ago as 1882, settlers entering Canada had numbered more than 100,000 a year, and immediately preceding the outbreak of war the movement had reached figures approximating 400,000 persons per year. During the war period immigration from Great Britain was almost entirely discontinued and the movement fell to relatively small figures. After 1918, there was again a steady increase, the total movement of immigrants to Canada for 1920-1 being 148,477, but in 1921-2 the number fell to 89,999 and to 72,887 in 1922-23, but rose to 148,560 in the year ending March 31st, 1924.

In view of the world wide industrial conditions during the period of reconstruction only those types of immigrants which can readily be absorbed into the industries of the country, namely, farmers, farm labourers and domestic workers, have been generally encouraged to migrate to Canada. Artisans and skilled labourers are welcomed only as conditions afford assurance of their employment. A vigorous system of inspection of immigrants is in effect, and the immigrant must satisfy the Canadian officials that he is desirable, physically and morally, before he can gain admission into Canada. At the present time each adult immigrant is also required to have $250 in money, in addition to a ticket to his destination, and half that sum is required with respect to children. This regulation may be waived in the case of farmers, farm labourers or domestic workers coming to assured employment, and in the case of certain immigrants from the United Kingdom.

**PRODUCTS.**

The total yield of wheat in Canada for the year 1923 was returned as 474,199,000 bushels from 22,671,864 acres. The average yield per acre for Canada was 21 bushels. For oats the production was 563,997,500 bushels from 14,387,807 acres. The average yield per acre was 39-25 bushels. Barley yielded 76,997,800 bushels from 2,784,571 acres, the average yield per acre being 27-75 bushels. Flaxseed gave a total yield of 7,139,500 bushels from 629,938 acres. The yield per acre was 11-30 bushels. For the remaining grain crops the total yields and average yields per acre were in bushels as follows:—Rye, 23,231,800, average 16; peas, 2,838,200, average 17-00; beans, 1,041,700, average 16-50; buckwheat, 9,743,700, average 22-25; mixed grains, 29,750,500, average 35-26; huskix corn, 13,608,000, average 42-75.

The production of potatoes in Canada in 1923 was 55,497,000 cwts. from 560,942 acres, an average of 99-00 cwts. per acre. Turnips, mangolds, etc., yielded 38,116,500 cwts. from 194,612 acres, an average of 196 cwts. per acre. Sugar beets yielded 216,200 tons from 22,450 acres, or 9-60 tons per acre. The yield of hay and clover was 14,844,900 tons from 9,725,602 acres. The average yield per acre was 1-55 tons. Grain hay yielded 4,336,100 tons from 1,920,432 acres, the average being 1-75 tons per acre. Alfalfa yielded 1,028,600 tons from 391,116 acres, or an average of 2-65 per acre.

The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The value of the yield in the calendar year 1923 was $42,565,545, and the number of men employed in connection with the fisheries was 68,964.

The principal minerals produced in 1923 were coal $72,058,986; copper $12,529,186; gold, $25,495,421; silver, $12,067,509; nickel, $18,332,077; natural gas, $5,884,618; lead, $7,985,522; asbestos, $7,522,506; zinc, $3,991,701; gypsum, $2,243,100; cobalt, $2,530,974; salt, $1,713,516. The total production of minerals was $214,312,857. Ship-building is an important industry, and, besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments.

The pulp and paper industry made satisfactory progress in 1923; there were 110 mills in operation, and the value of pulpwood exported, pulp made for export, and paper manufactured was $183,226,218.

A century ago the value of the furs exported was greater than that of any other product. Now the bison is gone, and the beaver and marten are following. But Canada is still the great fur preserve of the world; raw furs to the value of $16,206,225 were exported in the fiscal year 1923, and a vast area remains which will furnish the historic peltries when settlement permits.
The total of the products of the lumber industry in 1922 was $230,108,403. The timber on about four-fifths of the forest area is either too small or too far from transportation facilities to be worked profitably, but the conditions continually tend to improve.

**Shipping.**

The arrivals and clearances show, in the year 1924, a total tonnage of 152,312,601 tons. Engaged in sea going trade, 37,018,402 tons; 77,365,128 tons engaged in coasting trade, and 37,928,971 tons engaged on inland waters between Canada and the United States.

The number of vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1922, was 7,641, with a net tonnage of 1,241,524. Of this number 4,388 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 1,299,436. The estimated number of men and boys employed was over 50,000.

On March 31st, 1923, the number of lights shown was 1,596, lightships 9, and fog-alarm stations, 12; the number of fog whistles 8, hand fog horns, fog bells, etc., was 322; the number of gas buoys, whistling buoys, bell buoys, and submarine bells, 478; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lightships, was over 1,000.

**Railways.**

**Railways.**—The total railway mileage in Canada on December 31st, 1923, was 40,094 miles. On the same date the capital liability was $3,264,674,038. Of this amount $1,385,060,426 represents stocks, and $1,879,593,612 funded debt.

During the year ended December 31st, 1923, the steam railways carried 44,834,337 passengers and 113,289,604 tons of freight. The total earnings during the year were $478,338,046. The operating expenses were $413,862,818 as against $393,927,406 in the previous year.

The aid granted in the form of cash subsidies, loans, subscription to shares, etc., by the Dominion and Provincial Governments and Municipalities up to December 31st, 1923, is as follows:

| Dominion Government: |
|----------------------|
| Cash subsidies       | $121,308,750 |
| Loans                | 15,142,633   |
| Cost of Lines handed over to C.P.R. | 37,785,319 |
| Paid to Quebec Government | 5,160,053 |

Total | $179,390,756

| Provincial Governments | $8,35,322,123 |
| Municipalities         | 15,347,628 |

Grand Total | $220,066,506

The Dominion and Provincial Governments have also made land grants amounting to 46,886,797 acres.

The implement clause of the Grand Trunk Pacific agreement provides that the Government shall make up the difference between the amount realised in certain bonds and their par value. Since 1896 the aid granted to other railways includes the sum of $10,189,521 paid by the Government to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for land taken over by the Government from the Company's land subsidy.

On September 20th, 1917, an Act was passed authorising the Dominion Government to take over the Stock of the Canadian Northern System. This was appraised and finally acquired for $9,733,333 and the road taken over in September, 1919, and operated by the Government, through a Board of Directors. The total mileage of this system, including trackage rights, is 9,881.

In June, 1918, certain branch lines in New Brunswick were taken over by the Dominion Government, and during 1920 the Lotbiniere and Megantic, Caraquet and Gulf Short, Cape Breton, and Quebec and Saguenay also became part of the Government railways. The system known as the Canadian Government Railways, to distinguish from the Canadian Northern system, both systems comprising the Canadian National Railways, now includes the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, Prince Edward Island and the several small lines, and operated in 1921 a total of 4,535 miles (including trackage rights). The Canadian Government Railways also operated under contract the St. John and Quebec Railway with 172.07 miles of track.

In March, 1920, the Government took over control of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and branch lines as receiver, and during the same month entered into an agreement with the Grand Trunk Railway Company whereby the Government agreed to acquire the preference and common stock of the company, the value to be determined by arbitration and to guarantee payment of dividends on the present guaranteed stock amounting to 12,500,000£, and payment of interest upon the present debenture stock aggregating 31,926,126£.

On January 19th, 1923, the whole of the preference and common stock of the Grand Trunk Railway Company, was, by Order in Council, vested in the Minister of Finance in trust for His Majesty.

On January 20th, 1923, an Order in Council was passed handing over to the Canadian National Railway Board the management and operation of the Canadian Government Railways, designated specifically as: The Intercolonial Railway, The National Transcontinental Railway, The Lake Superior branch, leased from the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, The Prince Edward Island Railway, The Hudson Bay Railway, and all other railways and branch lines vested in His Majesty, and comprising what has been known as the Canadian Government Railways. This Order in Council superseded and cancelled the Order in Council of November 20th, 1918, which had appointed the Canadian Northern Board to operate and manage these railways.

The unification of the Grand Trunk and Canadian National Railways was provided for by Order in Council of January 30th, 1923, which also brought into effect the Act to incorporate the Canadian National Railway Company and respecting Canadian National Railways (Chap. 13, 1919). This was followed on February 5th, 1923, by an Order in Council establishing the head office of the Canadian National Railways at Montreal, Quebec.

The mileage operated, gross earnings, operating expenses and net operating revenue of the large systems of Canada, of which the first five now constitute the Canadian National Railways as one system are as follows:

| Canadian Government |
|---------------------|
| St. John and Quebec | 20,646 miles of single track |
| Canadian Northern    | " " " " " |
| Grand Trunk         | " " " " " |
| Grand Trunk Pacific  | " " " " " |
| Canadian Pacific     | 13,657 " " " |

Total | 34,908 " " "
The total single track mileage operated in Canada was 40,094. Although there is some slight duplication of miles of track over which these systems operate under trackage rights, they operate over 86 per cent. of the total trackage.

| Canadian Government | Gross Earnings | Operating Expenses | Net Operating Revenue |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Canadian Northern   | $216,578,175  | $204,921,713       | $11,656,463           |
| Grand Trunk Pacific |               |                    |                       |
| Canadian Pacific    | 192,827,990   | 155,040,207        | 37,787,723            |
| Totals              | 409,400,105   | 359,961,920        | 49,448,185            |

The Canadian National lines and the Canadian Pacific, the latter with 13,657 miles of track—comprise 86% of the total mileage in Canada and form three transcontinental systems. The Canadian Pacific main line extends from St. John to Vancouver, about 3,367 miles. The former Intercolonial and Canadian Northern main line extend from Halifax to Vancouver via Edmonton, while the Intercolonial from Halifax to Moncton, with the Transcontinental and Grand Trunk Pacific from Moncton to Prince Rupert, constitutes the third great transcontinental railway.

Telegraphs.

There are (1923) 53,383 miles of telegraph line, and 270,782 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 15,253, including 368 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 16,150,106 land messages were sent in 1923 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 4,930. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. Wireless Telegraphy.—At March 31st, 1923, there were 33,457 Radio-telegraph and wireless stations in operation in Canada, some with ranges up to 7,000 nautical miles. At Glace Bay near Cape Breton, N.S., and at Montreal, there are long distance stations with ranges of 3,000 nautical miles; one at Vancouver, B.C., with a range of 7,000 nautical miles; and also at Louisbourg, N.S., and Markham, Ont., with a range of 1,000 nautical miles. Thirty Government steamers are equipped with wireless apparatus having ranges of 100 to 1,000 miles. The telephone is very generally used. On the 31st December, 1923, there were 1,009,203 telephones and 2,574,083 miles of telephone wire in use. The revenue amounted to $42,132,959, and the operating expenses to $32,390,370. On December 31st, 1923, the capital liability of telephone companies in Canada was $142,518,243, of which $73,222,339 are stocks and $69,295,904 are funded debt.

There were, on March 31st, 1924, 1,229 electric light companies in Canada.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 1,594 (of which 117.2 are constructed canals), but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts for the year 1922 were $742,410, and the working expenses, including repairs were $2,552,841. Over $150,000,000 has been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not been reimposed. Total vessel tonnage through the canals during 1923 was 16,339,779, carrying 220,604 passengers, and 11,199,434 tons of freight.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars and cents, $4.863 being equal at par to one pound sterling. For convenience in reckoning, especially in taxation, the mill, one-tenth of a cent., is used, although it is not a unit of currency. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States as well as British gold coins are legal tender.

The Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint was established in pursuance of The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., c. 4), under which an annual sum not exceeding $75,000 is payable to the Imperial Treasury for the purpose of defraying the salaries of officials and other expenses of the Mint, the fees and all sums received being retained by Canada.

The Mint issues gold, silver, nickel and copper coins for circulation in Canada, and sovereigns and half-sovereigns coined are legal tender there and elsewhere under the British flag.

The Dominion Government and Postal Savings Banks, on March 31st, 1924, had $33,515,863 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit on March 31st, 1924, $64,194,326. In addition all the 16 chartered banks have savings departments, in which the deposits are "payable after notice or on a fixed day." The average amount of such deposits for 1923 was $1,197,277,065.

The following banks were established in Canada, Sept. 30th, 1924:

Excluding capital and rent or reserve fund.

In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1920 amounted to $15,501,360, and at March 31st, 1924, to $216,625,004. Under the Dominion Notes Act, 1914 (5 Geo. V. c. 4), the Dominion Government is authorized to issue notes up to and including $50,000,000 against a reserve in gold equal to one quarter of the amount. By Chapter 4, Acts of 1915, "an Act respecting the issue of Dominion Notes," the Dominion Government is authorized to issue notes up to $26,000,000 without any reserve of gold, $16,000,000 of the notes to be against certain specified Canadian railway securities guaranteed by the Dominion Government. Notes may be issued to any additional amount in excess of $76,000,000, but (except as provided by the Finance Act, 1914), an amount of gold equal to the excess must be held. Thus Dominion notes are under normal conditions gold certificates. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government. On July 1st, 1912, the Dominion Government issued five dollar notes for the first time.

**Post Office.**

The number of offices in 1923 was 12,288. The net revenue for the year ended March 31st, 1923, was $29,262,233, and the expenditure $27,794,502. At the end of the fiscal year 1922-23, there were 3,777 rural mail delivery routes, on which were erected 206,406 boxes.

On March 31, 1923, there were 5,337 Money Order offices; Orders issued, 11,098,222, value $143,055,120. During the year ended March 31, 1924, the Dominion Government paid $1,105,087 in Ocean Mail subsidies and steamship subventions.

The mail communication with Great Britain is now two or three times a week via Montreal or Quebec and New York in summer, and via Halifax or St. John and New York in winter. With the West Indies there is a fortnightly mail service via Halifax, and from three to four trips per week via United States ports. There is a through service twice a day across the continent from Halifax on the Atlantic to Vancouver on the Pacific coast by the Canadian Pacific and Intercolonial Railways, a monthly direct steam service with New Zealand and via New Zealand with Australia via Vancouver. With Japan and China there is a direct connection by steamer from Vancouver once every two weeks throughout the year.

The rates of postage are as follows:

**LETTERS.**—To Canada, United States and Mexico, *3 cents for the first oz., 2 cents for each additional oz.*; Great Britain and all other places within the Empire, *4 cents for the first oz., 3 cents for each additional oz.*; other countries, 10 cents for the first oz., 5 cents for each additional oz.

**POSTCARDS.**—Canada, Great Britain and all other places within the Empire, United States and Mexico, *2 cents each*; other countries 6 cents each.

**NEWSPAPERS.**—To Canada, United States and Mexico, and (if published in Canada) to United Kingdom and certain British Colonies, 1 cent per 4 oz.; in all other cases 2 cents per 2 oz.

There is a direct parcel post to Newfoundland, West Indies, New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, and Japan, Fiji, France, St. Pierre and Miquelon, British Guiana, British Honduras, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentine Republic, and the Union of South Africa, and parcel post via England to other countries.

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA)

History.

It is claimed that Sebastian Cabot discovered Cape Breton Island in 1497, but the first discoverer of Canada, properly so called, was Jacques Cartier, who having spent some time in Gaspe Harbour took possession of the country by setting up a cross, on the 24th July, 1534. In 1536 he sailed up the St. Lawrence which he named the River of Hochelaga, the name applied by the Indians to the region about the Lachine Rapids.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed in the main by military authority. In the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommenda-
lion, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1866 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

Constitution.

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each Province (Ontario, 111 members; Quebec, 85 members), elected for four years in Ontario and five years in Quebec by general suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $15 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $1,400. Members in Quebec receive $2,500 for each session of more than 30 days. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $2,500 as sessional indemnity.

Industry.

The industrial wealth of Ontario is derived, primarily, from its farms, its forests, mines and fisheries; secondarily, from its manufactures. In 1923, the value of the farm land, buildings, implements production and live stock of the province was $2,097,487,000. There are over 22,628,901 acres of cleared farm land now occupied and over 10,000,000 acres still available. The farms average 115 acres in extent, of which 81% are owned by the occupants. The average value of farm products per acre is greater than in any other province, and the total production of field crops is placed at $220,748,900 in 1923. Dairying and the breeding and feeding of live stock are combined with general farming. The value of the cheese and butter factory output is at present about $40,000,000 annually.

All the fruits usually grown in the temperate zone may be produced in Ontario, not only successfully, but in a very high degree of excellence. Apples constitute the principal crop, but tender fruits such as peaches, pears, plums and grapes, are very extensively grown in the Niagara peninsula. The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables is a well established industry. Total apple production in 1923 was estimated at 1,304,400 barrels.

The value of the output of the mines and mineral industries of Ontario in 1923 was $79,916,836, as compared with $65,866,029 in 1922. This increase was due in large part to a revival in the nickel-copper industry. The quantity of gold produced in 1923 was $20,293,622 as compared with $20,678,862 in 1922. In 1923, the quantity of silver produced was 10,540,943 ounces, worth $6,838,226. The quantity of nickel in the form of matte produced in Ontario in 1923 was 62,067,835 lbs. and copper in the form of matte was 31,538,710 lbs. The total value of nickel produced in Canadian refineries was $18,332,077, and of copper $4,554,442. Crude petroleum amounting to 159,400 barrels was produced in 1923, with a total value of $478,149, as well as 6,071,232 lbs. of arsenic, valued at $731,583.

Education.

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Cabinet for the elementary (public and separate) the continuation and high schools (including collegiate institutes) and the Vocational schools, all of which number 7,282, with 661,880 scholars (exclusive of evening school pupils) in 1922-3. The schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and five theological colleges are also affiliated. There are also two non-denominational and two denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges (private foundations) for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile offenders of both sexes. Education, elementary and secondary, is free and compulsory up to 16 years of age in urban centres. In rural sections it is compulsory up to 14 years. Public libraries receive Government grants.

Climate.

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal 42°; the extreme range being from 20° below zero to 96°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 26 inches; at Montreal 24 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is about 65 inches on the average at Montreal.

PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Quebec is growing rapidly through its agriculture, its industry and its mines. The municipalities of the Province have a total area of 24,596,866 acres, which is about one-ninth of the total area, excluding the northern part (formerly Ungava), which was annexed in 1912.

Most farmers own their farms, and the chief products are hay, oats and potatoes.

The value of the field crops, for the year 1923, is estimated at $133,000,000, compared with $88,000,000 for the year previous to the war (1913).

The raising of beef cattle is a business of considerable importance in the Eastern Townships, and throughout the Province mixed farming is a general practice.

Dairying is one of the most important industries on the farm. The total yield of the butter and cheese manufactured was over $29,500,000 in 1923. The butter of the Province of Quebec is renowned for its flavour, and has taken first prizes in International competitions, and the cheese commands the highest prices paid on the Montreal market by exporters to Europe.

In industrial development, Quebec has made rapid progress. The census of 1911 showed that the total value of manufactured products was $350,901,566; during the last twelve years the growth has been quite phenomenal. A preliminary statement published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics shows that the industrial production of Quebec for 1922 had a net value of $696,143,225. Montreal's share of that production was $406,846,230.

Amongst the most important industries are the following: lumber, pulp, paper, shipbuilding and repairs, slaughtering and meat packing, boots and shoes, flour and grist mill products, foundries, cotton, printing and publishing, leather, fur garments, cloth, tobacco, cigars, syrup and maple sugar, drugs and chemicals, liquors and malt, paints and varnishes.

To those interested in the mining industry, the Province of Quebec offers an attractive diversity of geological formations, including the Keewatin, Laurentian and Huronian, containing gold, silver, asbestos, lead, nickel, copper, iron, zinc, phosphate, mica and granite.

In the Eastern Townships are located the well-renowned mines of asbestos. Their production, which had a value of only $2,677,829 in 1910, reached in 1923 a production estimated at $7,519,906. The Province produces also several of the so-called "War minerals," such as pyrite, molybdenite, magnesite, chromite, the mining of which received a very strong impetus during the hostilities. Mica ranks next to asbestos in production (excluding production of structural materials and clay products) with a value of $216,684 in 1923; then comes magnesite, of which the output was, for the same year, $134,382.

While land values, both in town and country, show a steady improvement in this Province from year to year, Quebec has never experienced the speculative crisis that have characterized real estate transactions elsewhere, especially during the years previous to the war. During the war, production was greatly intensified in the Province, and every fiscal year ended with a material surplus. Quebec was the only Province where the moratorium was not imposed during the hostilities, and its credit, on the foreign markets, instead of diminishing, during the last years was increasing, and, hence, has largely escaped the financial stringency of the after-war readjustment.

The entire school organization in the Province of Quebec is under the immediate control of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, who is under the provincial Secretary. The Superintendent is assisted by an English Secretary and a French Secretary, who have the rank of deputy-minister. To a Council of Public Instruction is delegated certain large powers, and it is divided into two Committees, a Roman Catholic and a Protestant, and each of these Committees have the right to make the Regulations in regard to the organization and discipline of their respective schools. These powers include the making of the course of study, the authorization of text books, the issuing of diplomas and all such matters as directly affect the internal management of the schools. The local control is vested in local elective boards. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1922, 7,893 schools, with 570,430 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and fourteen normal schools supported by the Government. There are also forestry schools, dairy schools, trade schools, technical schools, schools for agriculture, schools for higher commercial studies and classical colleges, and four universities—two protestant: McGill University (Montreal) and Bishop's College (Lennoxville) and two Catholic: Laval University (Quebec) and Montreal University (Montreal).

In 1898, the schools' revenue was $2,608,121; ten years later, it amounted to $4,465,537; in 1921-22, it was $23,972,197.

The average cost of education per pupil in the Province of Quebec has increased rapidly; in 1900, it was $9.87; in 1910, $15.72; in 1922, $42.02.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between the 43rd and 47th parallels, connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 386 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 3,120 square miles. The Province is 21,428 square miles in area, a small part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the census of 1921 was 523,837.
History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I., in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the census of 1921 was 58,372. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock and ship-building plant is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Dartmouth, Digby, Glace Bay, Kentville, New Glasgow, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney, Sydney Mines, North Sydney, Amherst, Lunenburg and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney and New Glasgow, and these centres are developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production (preliminary figures) of some of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the calendar year 1923, is as follows:

- Coal raised ... ... 6,597,838 short tons.
- Gypsum ... ... 325,574 " "
- Arsenic ... ... 45,000 lbs.
- Gold ... ... 655 ounces.

There are large deposits of other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe. The 1923 crop is estimated at 1,836,481 barrels.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. Their value in 1923 was $8,448,385. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and there are plants for the construction of steel ships at New Glasgow and at Halifax. A large mill for the manufacturing of steel ships' plates is operating at Sydney.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 85°.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 10 Members in the Senate and 16 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of ten members (four of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 43 representatives elected every five years.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by a Board of Commissioners partly appointed by the Town Council and partly by the Government.

In 1923 there were 3,037 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 114,458. 4,504 attended the technical schools. Education is compulsory in towns, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

Under "The Technical Education Act," of 1907, local technical schools have been established in all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" has been established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college is the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,985 square miles, or about 17,910,400 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population in 1921, was 387,876.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 19° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 75 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 8,114 (1921), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 47,168 (1921)). Other towns are Moncton (17,488), Campbellton (5,570), Edmundston (4,035), Chatham (4,506), Woodstock (3,380), and St. Stephen (3,452).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 11 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 48 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $1,000 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were in 1923, the 2,108 schools and 78,753 scholars, exclusive of normal school, which had an enrolment of 459.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Area and Situation.

Manitoba became a Province of the Canadian Federation by legislative enactments taking effect on the 15th July, 1870. It is bounded on the north by the 60th parallel of latitude; on the west by the Eastern boundary of the Province of Saskatchewan; on the south by the United States; on the east by the western boundary of the Province of Ontario to Hudson's Bay, and by Hudson's Bay for a distance of 300 miles.

The area of Manitoba is 251,832 square miles, of which 232,000 square miles are land and about 20,000 square miles are water.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced.

Manitoba No. 1 Northern, because of its superior milling qualities, is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous. Winnipeg is now the leading grain market on the Continent. There is a steady trend toward diversified agriculture in Manitoba and but few farmers now confine their activities solely to grain growing.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle, bacon and dairy products. In 1923, agricultural production included:

Manitoba Field Crops, 1923.

| Fodder Corn   | 32,323   | 7'60                | 236,000     |

The average yield of wheat per acre for five years is 14'75 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $12 to $60 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1871 it contained about 241 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of 7,985; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is about 205,000, including suburbs. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Manitou, Deloraine, Dauphin, Souris, Virden, St. Boniface, Morris, Swan River, Gimli and The Pas. Population of Manitoba, 1921, 610,118.

Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the
manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful. A sand suitable for glass is found in great quantities. Gold, copper and other valuable minerals have been discovered in great quantities in different parts of the province, particularly in the new territory North of the Saskatchewan River, also to the East of Lake Winnipeg. Development, retarded by the war, is proceeding apace, and Manitoba, hitherto regarded as an agricultural province, gives every promise of becoming an important mining province.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg, the net annual output has grown from $8,616,248 in 1901 to $30,668,933 in the calendar year 1922. There were then 768 factories, employing over 13,799 workers, with a capital invested of $84,662,378.

The Winnipeg Power Plant on the Winnipeg River, 77 miles from the City of Winnipeg, now develops about 73,000 h.p. and is capable of developing 110,000 h.p., is owned and operated by the City. The cost of power energy is from 1/2 to 3 cents per K.W. hour, and household lighting is supplied at 2½ to 3 cents per K.W. hour. The plant is being increased at a cost of nearly $2,000,000. The Winnipeg Electric Railway has a development of 35,000 h.p. on the Pinawa Channel of the Winnipeg River; also the Manitoba Power Company has a development of 168,000 h.p. capacity, of which 2 units of 28,000 h.p. each have been installed.

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains. At the close of 1922 there were in the province of Manitoba 4,521 miles of steam railways in operation. These railways afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is 34.6°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°. The climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual precipitation at Winnipeg is 20-29 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 6 members in the Dominion Senate and 15 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 55 members elected by adult suffrage, for 5 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876. The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $1,500 per session.

Education.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, a system of national schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school." Attendance is compulsory to the age of 14.

In 1923 there were 1,982 schools in operation employing 3,936 teachers and with an enrolment of 142,369 pupils. Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with an enrolment in 1923 of 1,936 regular students, and 1,745 in extension courses. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical.

Brandon College, which is affiliated with McMaster University, does university work.

Manitoba also has an Agricultural College with an enrolment in 1923, of 260 in regular courses and 744 in short courses.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is the western province of the Dominion of Canada, situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprising the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian to the 54th parallel, and the Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.

The length of the coast line in a direct line north and south, is 541 miles, but the total length, following the sinuosities of the coast, is 4,334 miles, exclusive of islands. The coastline of Vancouver Island is 1,884 miles, and the length 288 miles. The area (including Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Island) is about 355,856 square miles. The distinguishing physical features of British Columbia are the great mountain ranges which intersect the country in parallel lines, the general direction being north and south; the extensive plateaux of the central interior; the rich valleys which produce in abundance all kinds of agricultural produce; the vast forests of commercial timber; and the deeply indented seaboard. The population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, 1901, 178,657, 1911, 392,480; 1921, 524,582.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, in consequence of the large immigration on the discovery of gold in the Thompson and Fraser Rivers. Vancouver Island was granted to the Hudson's Bay Company under certain conditions in 1849, and the same year it was made a Crown colony. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united under the former name, and on July 20th, 1871, British Columbia entered the Dominion of Canada as a Province. The Province is represented by six members in the Senate, and fourteen members in the House of Commons of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and an Executive Council, or Cabinet, of eight Ministers, members of the legislative assembly of 48 members, on the British system of ministerial responsibility. The House of Assembly is elected for five years, every male and female adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the Province and duly registered, being entitled to a vote. In 1917 by the Provincial Elections Amendment Act, the franchise was extended to women. Members of the Legislature receive a sessional indemnity of $2,000, and a mileage allowance for travelling expenses.

Crown Land and Surveys.

The area of the Province of British Columbia is 227,747,200 acres. Of this area about 9,000,000 acres are crown granted, 2,000,000 granted to Railway Companies, 15,000,000 acres controlled by the Dominion Government, and about 1,600,000 acres in process of alienation, leaving about 200,000,000 acres available for disposition under the various Land Acts. About 7,500,000 acres are held under timber licences or leases, 700,000 acres under grazing or coal leases, and 2,100,000 acres under parks and game reserves. A total of
22,510,903 acres of land have been surveyed, 8,945,119 acres of which are surveys of timber areas, and 466,117 acres of mineral claims. Approximately 2,000,000 acres of surveyed lands are available for free preemption. Geographic and land maps can be obtained on application to the Department of Lands; also maps, handbooks and descriptive matter from the Bureau of Provincial Information.

**Agriculture.**

Agriculture in British Columbia has progressed steadily during the past four years. Mixed farming, stockraising, dairying, fruit-growing, poultry raising, and truck-gardening are the principal sources of agricultural production in the Province.

**Estimated Agricultural Revenue.**

1923 total, $43,376,000—livestock $1,845,000; field crops $18,912,000; poultry and eggs $3,397,000; fruit and vegetables $13,344,000; wool $51,000; dairy products $5,767,000; other $60,000.

Arable land in British Columbia is estimated to be about 22,600,000 acres, or 10 per cent. of the total area, of which the area at present under cultivation is only 2-2 per cent., and 12 per cent. of the total area occupied as farm land. The total number of farms is estimated to be 20,300.

**Mining Industry.**

The total mineral production of British Columbia during the year 1923 (preliminary) amounted in value to $44,143,390, towards which sum gold contributed $3,952,041; coal and coke $13,813,520; copper $8,127,740; and silver $3,869,087.

Collieries produced net production of 2,823,306 tons valued at $13,813,520.

The minerals of the Province chiefly consist of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, and coal. Approximately 230,000 square miles of country still remain to be explored for minerals.

Detailed reports are obtainable from the Bureau of Mines, Victoria.

| Imports         | $67,564,572  |

**Revenue and Expenditure, 1923-4.**

| Receipts       | Expenditure |
|----------------|-------------|
| $19,621,208    | $18,837,184 |

**Forest Wealth.**

The stand of merchantable timber in the Province of British Columbia is estimated to reach the enormous total of four billion (400,000,000,000) feet board measure, which is over half the total of all Canada.

British Columbia occupies an especially advantageous position for supplying the overseas markets. It has vast quantities of timber unsurpassed in size, quality and suitability for the manufacture of all kinds of dimension timber, lumber, piling, railway ties, pulp, paper and other products. The principal export timber trees of British Columbia are Douglas Fir, Western Red Cedar, Western Hemlock, and Sitka Spruce or Silver Spruce. The total production from British Columbia forests during 1923 was 447,433,011 cubic feet, value $30,566,860.

**Water Resources.**

All the water in rivers and streams of the Province is in the right of the Crown and may be appropriated for various purposes under the rules and regulations of the Water Act. Of these purposes the most important is Power and Irrigation. In respect of the first mentioned, there is probably no area on the continent of America so favoured in water power resources. Large power sites are strategically situated so that in time many districts may be served with electrical energy by transmission lines of economic length.

It is of interest to note that contiguous to Vancouver, the largest centre of population, within a radius of one hundred miles, there is available well over 750,000 horse power, of which over 150,000 is developed, while 250,000 horse power is developed on the Kootenay River near Nelson, and is supplying smelters at Trail and Grand Forks. In regard to irrigation, such is largely practiced south of the 51st parallel of latitude. Water has been recorded for upwards of 600,000 acres of lands, of which approximately 100,000 have been brought under cultivation. Our fruit areas depend largely, if not wholly, upon irrigation. The largest and one of the most important of these is the Okanagan Valley, which now has a well-established fruit and vegetable industry. Through co-operation in production and marketing, those areas dependent upon irrigation are becoming very attractive.

**Fisheries.**

The commercial fisheries of British Columbia are of considerable importance. Salmon, halibut, and herring are the principal food fishes, and cod, oolachans, pilchard, clams, oysters, shrimps, etc., are also produced in large quantities. The whale fisheries are also a not unimportant branch of the fishing industry.

Value of total production, 1923, $20,795,914.

**Iron and Steel.**

Large iron deposits, magnetite, limonite and haematite, exist, with large metallic iron content and sufficiently free from impurities to be within the "Bessemer limit." Anticipations are that steel and iron will be developed in the near future.
Railways.

British Columbia has 4,395 miles of steam railway in operation (Dec. 31st, 1923). The Canadian Pacific Railway, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, the Canadian Northern Railway, and the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, are the main railways of the Province, with various branches of the Canadian Pacific Railway extending through the southern and south-western portions of the Province, and additional lines entering the Province from the United States.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in municipal school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether cities of the first, second or third class, or district municipalities) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 67 high schools, 352 teachers, 9,220 scholars in the Province. The number of publicly controlled (including high) schools in operation is 1,044, under 3,118 teachers. The total enrolment is 94,888. The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma or creed is permitted to be taught. Schools are established wherever there are 10 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64½° W. long. Its area is 1,397,990 acres, or 2,184 square miles; it is about 150 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of the inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census (1921) was 88,615.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous grain mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established. The
breeding and raising of silver and black foxes in captivity is an important industry, there being about 448 (1923) fox ranches in the province.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,347) and Summerside (3,228). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

**Constitution.**

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $500 per annum.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

**Education**

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of the Executive Council and the Chief Supt. of Education and the Principal of Prince of Wales College. The local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 7 and 13 years. There were in 1923, 471 schools, with 17,742 pupils. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic University not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens.

**Finance.**

There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a road tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

Total Revenue for the year ended 31st Dec., 1923 ... $816,385.
Total Expenditure, same year $1,013,745.
Dominion Subsidy ,, ,, $372,181.88 (included in above receipts).

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were formed out of the southern portion of the Territories, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South being meridian 110 West of Greenwich.

SASKATCHEWAN.

Saskatchewan, called after the river of the same name, meaning "rapid current," has an area of 251,700 sq. miles, and a population in 1921 of 757,510 persons, an increase of 285,078 over that of 1911. It lies between 102°-110° West and 49°-60° North, with Manitoba on the East and Alberta on the West. The Government consists of a Lieut.-Governor, an Executive Council and a representative Assembly of 63 members. The Province is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 16 members in the House of Commons, and 6 in the Senate. The seat of Government is at Regina (named in honour of Queen Victoria).

The remarks regarding the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply to Saskatchewan. Free grants of lands can still be had, although the bulk of the land within convenient reach of the railways has already been allotted. The agricultural industry of the Province has made phenomenal progress, and marked development is seen in manufacturing spheres.

PROVINCE OF ALBERTA.

Alberta, as noted above, was erected into a Province by an enactment of the Parliament of Canada, taking effect September 1st, 1905, out of the territory acquired from the Hudson's Bay Company. Previously it formed part of the North-West Territories. The total area of the Province is 255,585 square miles, including about 2,500 square miles of water. The Government is vested in a Lieut.-Governor, an Executive Council, and a Legislative Assembly composed of sixty-one (61) members elected by the people, for five years. The Executive Council consists of eight Members. The seat of Government is at Edmonton.

The population of Alberta increased from 73,022, in 1901, to 588,454, in 1921.

Alberta has about 85 per cent. of the coal resources of the Dominion, and 25 per cent. of the coal resources of North and South America. It has some anthracite, but very large supplies of domestic, and also steam and coking coal. Coal beds cover a large part of the area of the province. The production of coal mines for 1923 was almost 7,000,000 tons.

It has valuable fish and timber resources in the centre and north, and is noted for its game of all kinds.

The total area in crops, 1923, was 11,316,342 acres. Of this 9,053,523 was in grain.

| Crop          | Acres   | Yield    |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| Fall Wheat    | 84,260  | 2,359,000|
| Spring Wheat  | 5,874,101| 164,475,000|
| Oats          | 2,299,546| 114,977,000|
| Barley        | 383,858  | 14,774,000|
| Rye           | 396,758  | 7,640,000 |
| Flax          | 15,000   | 156,000  |

Millions of acres of free lands are open for entry, chiefly in the northern part of the province. The dairy productions in 1923 was worth approximately $22,975,000. The province has a large outside market for surplus creamery butter.

There are 1,784 miles of steam railway in operation (Dec. 31, 1923). The Government of Alberta own, control and operate the telephone system of the Province, the Long Distance lines consisting of approximately 35,700 miles.

There is a University of Alberta at Edmonton.

The boundaries of the Yukon Territory were defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897, amended by C. 41 of 1 Ed. VII.

By 61-62 Vict., C. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate territory, and by C. 63, S. 7, the local government of the territories is vested in a Commissioner and an elective council. The Commissioner administers the government of the territory under instructions from time to time given him by the Governor in Council or the Minister of the Interior.

By Order in Council dated the 28th March, 1913, the Office of Commissioner was abolished and the duties transferred to and vested in the Gold Commissioner of the Territory.

From 1896 to 31st March, 1924, the Yukon produced $161,975,290 in gold. The production was at its maximum in the year 1900, but there has been a gradual falling off in the output since that time. For the fiscal year ending 31st March, 1924, the production of gold was valued at $1,136,368.36. The population is 4,500.
