NORTHERN RHODESIA.

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambezi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 291,000 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine magisterial districts for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, the centre of the mining industry, Fort Jameson, Lusaka, Mazabuka, Ndola near which the copper mines of Bwana Mkuwa are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu-Lealui in Baroteland.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambesi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interceptioned on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Baroteland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the great war with forces from German East Africa,
and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbeck doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November, his advanced parties opened fire on the Company's rubber factory on the Chamberzi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the Company's District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities. The number of individual Rhodesians (men and women) known to have undertaken duties in connection with the war was 7,009. Of these, 6,853 served with H.M. Forces during the war, 469 being from Northern Rhodesia. 791 were killed in action or died of wounds or disease.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 20th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. R. A. J. Goode as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika District of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924, the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs and the Principal Medical Officer. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and five unofficial members, to be nominated at first until provision for their election has been made by law. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse District is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied. The Civil jurisdiction of Native Commissioners' Courts is limited to causes or matters concerning natives. They also have criminal jurisdiction over natives with limitations. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Native Commissioners' Courts to Magistrates, and from Magistrates' Courts to the High Court.

Population.

The European population at the 31st March, 1924, was returned as 4,182, comprising 1,919 adult males and 1,016 adult females. The native population is estimated at about 1,000,000.

Education.

With the exception of the Barotse National School at Mongu and the Maramba Location School at Livingstone, which are under Government control, the education of the natives is in the hands of the Missionary Societies. For the education of European children there are six Government Schools, four farm schools and one Government-aided school. The total attendance at all European schools in October, 1924, was 346.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from $70^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ with a maximum of $103^\circ$ and a minimum of $56^\circ$. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from $55^\circ$ to $75^\circ$ with a maximum of $86^\circ$ and a minimum of $40^\circ$. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of $120^\circ$, whilst minima round about $30^\circ$ are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.
The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period July to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations shew is 37.5 inches per annum.

Commerce and Industries.

Farming occupies the bulk of the European inhabitants, the chief crop grown hitherto being maize, but the cultivation of cotton is now being undertaken on a large scale. The cattle industry is of considerable and increasing importance. Tobacco is the staple crop of the Fort Jameson district. Other crops grown are fibre, wheat, oil seeds and citrus fruits. Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Extensive mineral deposits of lead and zinc have been located at Broken Hill and of copper at Bwana Mkuwaba and elsewhere in the north-western districts. Gold and silver have been discovered and coal exists in quantity but is not being worked at present. The total value of the mineral output of Northern Rhodesia from the commencement of operations to the 31st December, 1923, amounted to £3,068,179. In the year 1923, 12,355 tons of lead, 51 tons of vanadium ore, 144 tons of copper, 6,282 ounces of silver and 1,591 ounces of gold were produced.

Means of Communication.

The extension of the railway from Victoria Falls northward was opened for traffic as far as Broken Hill, 374 miles from the Falls, on the 1st September, 1906, and the further extension to the northern border of Northern Rhodesia was completed by the Rhodesia Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company Limited in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet above the level of the river. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa. Road communications are gradually being opened. The Zambezi, Kafue, Luapula and Chambesi rivers are navigable for a considerable portion of their course.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyassaland. There are 37 post offices in the territory, 11 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and the African Transcontinental Telegraph Company's system links up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyassaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the territory is 2,227 miles.

An income tax was first imposed in Northern Rhodesia in 1921. The rate of tax at present in force is 1s. for every 1l. of the taxable amount; provided however that should the taxable amount exceed 500l., the rate of tax in respect of the whole taxable amount shall be increased by 1d. in the 1l. for each 200l. or fraction thereof in excess of 500l. Abatements are at the rate of 1,000l. for married and 500l. for other persons.
