NAURU.

Nauru (0° 26' S., 166° 56' E.), or Pleasant Island, an uplifted atoll, about 12 miles in circumference, was discovered by Captain Fearn in 1798, and was annexed by Germany in 1888. It has an area of nearly 8½ square miles. There is a ring of low and fertile land between the sea and a plateau about 40 to 60 feet above sea level, in the centre of which is a shallow lagoon. The plateau contains extensive deposits of phosphate bearing rock.

* Subject to revision.
Nauru was surrendered to H.M.A.S. "Melbourne" in November, 1914, and, at the request of the Commonwealth Government, was administered under the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific until June 10th, 1921. A mandate conferred by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers on the British Empire to administer Nauru was approved by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920.

By an agreement of 2nd July, 1919, confirmed by the Nauru Island Agreement Act 1920 and by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand, the British Government and the Governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand agreed that the island should be governed by an Administrator, the first to be appointed for a term of 5 years by the Commonwealth Government. The agreement also provided for the working of the phosphate deposits. The exclusive right to work these deposits was granted by the German Government to a German company, which transferred it in 1906 to the Pacific Phosphate Company, a company registered in Great Britain, which commenced to work the deposits in 1906. In 1920 the interests of the Company in Nauru and in the phosphate deposits of Ocean Island were purchased by the British, Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments. By the agreement between the three Governments, the deposits in Nauru were vested in, and the working and sale of the phosphates entrusted to, a Board of three Commissioners, one appointed by each Government. In 1922, 182,170 tons, and in 1923 212,300 tons of phosphates were exported, mainly to Australia and New Zealand. The only other export is a small quantity of copra.

The population in 1923 numbered about 2,000, of these, 1,179 were natives of Nauru, 603 Chinese, and 110 Europeans, the remainder being South Sea Islanders other than Nauruans. Administrator, Brigadier-General T. Griffiths.

**NORTH BORNEO.**

**Situation and Area.**

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitang River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 29,184 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at Jesselton. Other stations are at Labuk, Kotabehud, Tuaran, Tambunan, Kaningau, Tenom, Beaufort, Pensiangan, Lamag, Papar, Putatan, Ranau, Langkow, Semporna Mempakul, Sipitang and Rundum.

**General Description.**

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The country is mountainous. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who according to the Census taken in 1921 number about 257,804, are mainly Bruneis, Ilanuns, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the interior they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt, clearing fresh jungle every year; the Muruts, another interior tribe, are very numerous and peaceable, occasionally varying more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting raids on a petty scale.

There are Chinese settlements on the coast; they cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. There are 415 Europeans and 37,500 Chinese in the territory. Sandakan, the chief town with suburbs, has a population of 12,000. There are several missions, including the Church of England, with stations at Kudat and Jesselton and Beaufort, and the Roman Catholic, with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission also has schools at Kudat, Beaufort and Papar, and at Sandakan and Tenom. A few Government vernacular schools have recently been opened.

**History.**

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1550, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775 and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive concessions in North Borneo in 1868 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in...
Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultan of Brunei and Sulai ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (afterwards Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory, by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 120 inches, according to situation.

Industry.

The principal products of the country are estate rubber, timber, tobacco, coal, copra and cutch. The last decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of the rubber industry. The value of rubber exported in 1918 was 670,767l., in 1919, 782,037l., in 1920, 689,403l., in 1921, 289,634l., in 1922, 310,365l., and in 1923, 560,762l. The vast timber resources of the country form one of its principal assets, but until recently only the fringe of the forests was being worked. A Company was however formed in 1920 for more adequate timber exploitation with modern lumbering apparatus. Timber is being exported in increasing quantities to China, Australia and England; the exports in 1922 being valued at 170,411l. and in 1923, 185,627l. At Sandakan two large sawmills have been working for some years, and a modern band sawmill has been recently installed. Tobacco was formerly the principal article of export. Exports of tobacco were valued at 49,449l. in 1918, 230,122l. in 1919, 200,376l. in 1920, 149,901l. in 1921, 107,530l. in 1922, and 133,885l. in 1923. Exports of coal in 1922, 81,306l.. The number of coconut plantations has rapidly increased, and exports of copra have risen considerably in value; the exports of copra in 1922 were 49,586l. and in 1923, 54,729l. Cutch, a tanning material obtained from the bark of certain trees, is manufactured at Sandakan; exports in 1922, 44,216l. and in 1923, 37,297l. Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper and tea. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay.

The extraction of alcohol from the Nipah palm is in course of exploitation, a small factory having been established in the Labuk District for this purpose.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, etc., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself directly engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, stamps, and royalties, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.

Development.

Sandakan on the East and Jesselton on the West are the principal ports. Both towns have developed rapidly, and are now supplied with electric light and cold storage. Considerable sums have been spent by Government on reclamation, improvement of water supplies, etc., at both ports.

Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports. Sandakan is also rapidly becoming of importance as a coaling station for ocean liners. The exports of coal in 1923 were valued at 51,191l. Gold in alluvial form is found in certain of the rivers on the East Coast.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. Indications of the presence of petroleum occur in many parts of the State and prospecting work is being carried out by concessionary companies.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent. pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent. and 5 cent. pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars. A State Bank of North Borneo has been established with head office at Sandakan, and a branch office at Jesselton. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Bank of Taiwan.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are five Residencies, viz., the Sandakan, West Coast, East Coast, Kudar and Interior Residencies.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British Colonies, and an Imam's court, for the administration of Mohamedan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 750 armed police under European officers.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every week between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government have constructed a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Beaufort, 20 miles, and from Beaufort to Jesselton, 57
miles, and a line of 33 miles from Beaufort to Tenom, which will open up the interior. In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 120 miles. The principal coastal terminus is Jesselton, at which port there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. Over 600 miles of telegraph line are open, and wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau. Several riding roads already exist, and over 400 miles of bridle path have been constructed. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about twenty-six days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 6 cents per oz.; foreign countries, 12 cents for the first oz., 6 cents each succeeding oz.

On the completion of the Singapore—Labuan—Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, Sembilan, Lahad Datu and Lamag. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Lamag and Lahad Datu from Sandakan, and Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan and Kudat.
