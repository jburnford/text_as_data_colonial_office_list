ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is the largest coraline island on the African coast, being 48 miles long by 15 broad, and having an area of 640 square miles. To the north east at a distance of some thirty miles lies the island of Pemba in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 40 miles long by 10 broad, and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The annual rainfall amounts approximately in Zanzibar to 58 inches and in Pemba to 83 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined: the heavy rains occur in April previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The thermometer ranges from 77° to 90° with a minimum of 80°. The climatic conditions though trying in the hot season which lasts from November to March are not necessarily unfavourable to Europeans provided that periods of residence are limited to terms of from twenty to thirty months.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors and are the principal landowners of the islands. The conditions of life in a malarious and tropical country have deprived them of much of the vigorous temperament which distinguished their ancestors and the stoppage of the supply of slaves has left many of them almost without any resources. Nevertheless, though shaken by the ordeal through which they have passed, they still possess most of the land, and carry on the clove growing industry for which the two islands are famous. They understand the natives, and the natives understand them and accept their control more readily than that of any other race, except Europeans.

The bulk of the Zanzibar population consists of representatives of all the tribes of East Africa, intermingled with an Asiatic element. The name given to this mixed population is Swahili, a term formerly used to note the coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "ashil" in Arabic meaning coast.

The descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern portion of the island and especially on the east coast. They are the principal cattle breeders of the island. An Mhadimu is literally a servant, a term bestowed by the northern tribes when they conquered the country.

The natives of Pemba are known as Wapemba; they do not live in such seclusion as the Wahadimu on the larger island, but intermingle more freely with the Arabs and Swahili.

Khojas, Bohoras, Hindoos, Parsees, Goanese possess most of the trade of Zanzibar either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders or skilled mechanics. Goanese keep the European stores and provide both cooks and dhobis. They and the Parsees are also employed largely as clerks.

There is a considerable contingent of natives of Tanganyika Territory and of the Comoro islands who have settled in Zanzibar and with the northeast monsoon arrive numbers of Somalis, Shih Arabs and Baluchis in dhows laden with products of their countries. These people usually return with the southwest monsoon, but a few remain and settle permanently.

History.

The early history of Zanzibar is chiefly a record of petty feuds and complicated quarrels. The so-called "Zenj Empire" was already declining when the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral towards the close of the fifteenth century. It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. In allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1866 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Twaan of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by making the island his permanent residence and by encouraging the cultivation of cloves. Under his direction Zanzibar became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "all Africa as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warmbein in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°-42° S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000L. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000L.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khalifa, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1896 the Imperial Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized its Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1912, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.
legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

**Industries and Trade**

The clove industry is by far the most important in the Protectorate, the Islands of Zanzibar and Pemba yielding the bulk of the world's supply. The clove was first introduced into Zanzibar from Réunion in 1813, and Sir Richard Burton remarks that as early as 1835 it had "almost supplanted the vulgar valuable coconut and the homely rice necessary for local consumption." He advised the Arabs of Zanzibar to follow the example of Mauritius and to give up cloves in favour of sugar. Colonel Rigby wrote in 1860:—"Were the prosperity of the Zanzibar Dominions dependent upon these degenerated Arabs it might well be despised of," and complained of their lack of initiative in refusing to cultivate anything else. In spite of advice, however, and notwithstanding disasters—the hurricane of 1872, which devastated the main island, cutting off every clove and coconut tree, and the smallpox epidemic of 1898, which decimated the population—the Arabs clung to their cloves, and, by thus concentrating on one product, "surpassing all plants in value," to quote Lord Acton, have given Zanzibar a position on the world's market which she would probably never have attained had her energies been dissipated over a large variety. It is estimated that there are in both Islands about 48,000 acres under cloves and about 34 million trees in bearing. The output varies considerably, the trees yielding heavy crops every three to five years; the average output of recent years has been about 14 million lbs. The large plantations are chiefly owned by Arabs, but many natives possess small holdings.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 45,000 acres under cultivation and 34 million trees in both Islands. The export of copra, which is steadily increasing, amounted to 14,191 tons in 1923. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Cochin and Ceylon.

The principal export besides cloves and copra is chillies; re-exports, gum copal, hides and skins, ivory and rubber.

The chief imports are piece-goods, rice, various grains and petroleum.

**Currency and Banking**

The silver rupee of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, is the standard coin of Zanzibar. All other silver coins of British India of the standard weight and fineness enacted in the Indian Coinage Act, 1906, are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. These coins are \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \) and \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a rupee. British India 1 rupee notes are also legal tender to any amount. Seyyidieh copper pice are legal tender at the rate of 64 pice to 1 rupee for the payment of an amount not exceeding 5 rupees. There is a Government note issue of the denominations Rupees 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500.

The National Bank of India, Ltd., and the Standard Bank of South Africa have branches in Zanzibar.

**Shipping and Communications**

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend to indicate that the Island will continue, by reason of its geographical position, to retain control of the local traffic.

The British India Steam Navigation Company and the Union Castle Steamer Company maintain monthly services between London—Zanzibar—Durban and Southampton—Zanzibar—Durban respectively, the Clan-Killerman-Harrison Line between Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), and the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes between Marseilles—Zanzibar—Madagascar. The British India Steam Navigation Company also maintain a service twice a month between Bombay—Zanzibar—Durban, and there are local services between Zanzibar—Mombasa—Aden and the Benadir Coast. The Government possesses two steamers which maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba and Dar-es-Salaam.

The steamers of the Societa Maritima Italiana call about once a month between Genoa and Durban and back to Genoa.

The steamers of the Holland Africa Line call about once in 21 days between Amsterdam and back to Amsterdam via Durban.

The steamers of the German East Africa Line maintain a six-weekly service between Hamburg and East Africa both via the Cape and via the Suez Canal.

There is cable communication with Europe either via Aden or via Durban.

There are 75 miles of roads throughout the Island of Zanzibar suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations in Zanzibar and Pemba and a telephone system in the town of Zanzibar which is connected with the District and Agricultural Stations in the country. A light railway runs north from the town to Bububu, 7 miles distant.

There are 7 post offices in the two Islands.

**Constitution and Government**

The Government is administered by a High Commissioner and a British Resident, who are appointed by commissions under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercise their functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1914.

Legislation consists of certain British and Indian Statutes, and also of Decrees of His Highness the Sultan, which latter are binding on all persons when countersigned by the British Resident under the Order in Council.

There is a Council for the Protectorate which exercises functions of an advisory and consultative nature and consists of His Highness the Sultan as President, the British Resident as Vice-President, and three official and four unofficial members.

Justice is administered in His Britannic Majesty's Court for Zanzibar and in the Court for Zanzibar and Pemba, the former exercising jurisdiction over British and foreign subjects and in all cases in which one of the parties is a British
or foreign subject, and the latter over subjects of His Highness the Sultan. Appeals from His Britannic Majesty's Court for Zanzibar lie to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa.

APPENDIX TO PART II.

This Appendix gives some account of Iraq (Mesopotamia), Nauru, North Borneo, Palestine, Sarawak and certain miscellaneous British Possessions and Protectorates which are not included in the main portion of the Historical and Statistical Account above.

IRAQ (MESOPOTAMIA).

Iraq, in the sense in which the name is used now, is that part of the former Ottoman Empire which stretches from Fao on the Persian Gulf to a point north of Mosul and just south of Jazirah-ibn-Umar, on the Tigris. It comprises the vilayets of Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul.

The area of Iraq is 116,611 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the Turkish frontier, which has not been finally fixed. On the east, it is bounded by Persia. The frontier, the delimitation of which was completed by a Turko-Persian Commission in 1914, runs in the north through, and in the southern portion skirts, the Kurdish mountains which form the western edge of the Persian plateau, and descends 10 miles above Mohammerah to the Shatt-al-Arab, the river formed by the union of the Euphrates and the Tigris. On the south, Iraq is bounded by the Persian Gulf and Kuwait; and on the south-west and west by the deserts of northern Arabia and Syria. On the north-west, the boundary between Iraq and Syria was provisionally settled by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920. It runs from the Tigris at Faishkhhabur to Albu Kamal on the Euphrates, and thence across the desert to Imtar, south of Jabal Druz. Apart from the hill country in the north-east, Iraq mainly consists of great plains traversed by the Euphrates and the Tigris. The country between these rivers is divided into two parts. The southern portion, stretching from Baghdad to Basrah is a great alluvial plain about 35,000 square miles in area with a fertile soil wherever the land can be irrigated without being drowned. A considerable extent of it is, however, covered by marshes formed by the uncontrolled action of the river and canals. The northern portion known as Jazirah or "the Island," is more undulating and is in places broken by ranges of hills. It is fertile under irrigation in the north, but further south the plains become more arid until they pass into a hard desert tract.

The climate of Iraq is of the continuous sub-tropical type, with very high temperatures in summer in the plains. In July and August the mean daily maximum temperature is 104° F. at Basrah, and 110° F. at Baghdad, while in December and January the mean daily minimum temperature is 47° F. at Basrah and 40° F. at Baghdad. The rainy season is from November to March. There is a rainless summer of six months lasting from about April to September. The Basrah area has a rainfall of about 13 inches a year and relies on the rain to grow its crops. The rest of the country, however, has an annual rainfall of only about seven inches, and the crops are grown with very little help from the rain, on irrigated land.

The chief towns are Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, Karbala, and Najaf. The two last, situated on the edge of the Arabian desert, are pilgrim centres which attract Shiites from all parts of the Mohammedan world, but especially from Persia and India.

Population.

According to a census taken in 1920 the population numbers 2,849,282, made up as follows:

|                | Sunni. | Shi'ah. | Jewish. | Christian. | Other Religions. | Total |
|----------------|--------|---------|---------|------------|------------------|-------|
| Basrah Vilayet | 42,558 | 721,414 | 10,088  | 2,551      | 8,989            | 785,600|
| Baghdad Vilayet | 524,414| 750,421 | 62,565  | 20,771     | 2,133            | 1,360,304|
| *Mosul Vilayet*| 579,713| 22,180  | 14,835  | 55,470     | 31,180           | 703,378|
| Total          | 1,146,685| 1,494,015| 87,488  | 78,792     | 42,302           | 2,849,282|

* The figures for Mosul include the population of the Kurdish area of Sulaimaniyah, viz., 155,000, of whom all but 1,100 are Sunnis.

Natural Products.

The chief articles of export from Iraq before the war were dates, wool and barley. Dates and wool have continued to be exported, but the export of barley fell almost to nothing, mainly because of the purchases made by the British military authorities in Iraq, but is now beginning to revive. Round Mosul the prevailing crop is wheat, but all the wheat grown is consumed in the country. Rice, in most cases "red" rice of inferior quality, is grown on the swampy lands on the Middle Euphrates, in the Amarah area on the Tigris, and to a small extent, on the Diyala canals near Baghdad. Rice of better quality but in very small quantities is grown in the Kurdish hills.

In the Kurdish regions round Sulaimaniyah and Rawanduz and to the north of Mosul tobacco is an important crop. The crop is hardly sufficient for local requirements. None is exported.

In all parts of Iraq cotton can be grown. Experiments carried out since the occupation of Baghdad in 1917 tend to show that Iraqi cotton compares favourably with cotton grown in other parts of the world.
Wool is exported in considerable quantities. The principal sheep rearing districts are the Mosul area and the Kurdish hills.

There are traces of petroleum in many places around Mosul and Kirkuk and near the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanaqin.

Minor products are millet, licorice root, gallnuts, gum and dye-roots.

Railways.

The railways open to traffic are—

Metre Gauge.

1. From Basrah to Baghdad with branch to Hindiyah Barrage and Karbala.
2. From Baghdad to Quraiatu on the Persian frontier with a branch line to Kifri.

In all, 634 miles of open line and 911 miles track mileage.

An extension from Kifri northwards to Kirkuk is being constructed.

Standard Gauge (ft. 8½in.).

3. From Baghdad to Sharqat 187 miles of open line and 213 miles track mileage.

With the exception of about 75 miles of the Baghdad-Sharqat line, which was built by the Baghdad Railway Company before the war, the whole of this railway system has been made by the British authorities during and since the war.

There is a gap of 70 miles between the Mesopotamian railroad at Sharqat and Mosul; and the Baghdad Railway comes down to Nisibin, about 110 miles from Mosul. Thus railway communication between Constantinople and Basrah, via Aleppo, Mosul and Baghdad is complete except for a gap of less than 200 miles.

Government. †

The war left Iraq in British occupation; and by the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey renounced all sovereignty over the country. On March 2nd, 1921, the supervision of the affairs of Iraq was transferred to the Colonial Office.

In Turkish times each of the three Vilayets was governed by a Vali, who received orders directly from Constantinople. The official hierarchy, in descending order of importance, was:

- Vali … in charge of Vilayet.
- Mutasarrif … Liwa.
- Qaimmaqam … Qadha.
- Mudir … Nahiyah.

As Iraq came under British control, as a result of the military operations of 1914-1918, British Political Officers took over the administration of liwas and qadhias, working under the orders of the Chief Political Officer (later the Civil Commissioner). This system was modified when Sir Percy Cox was appointed High Commissioner. When he took up his post in the autumn of 1920, he organised a provisional native Government composed of a Council of Arab Ministers which was presided over by the Naqib of Baghdad. On August 23rd, 1921, the Sharif Faisal, third son of the King of the Hejaz was proclaimed King of Iraq, by virtue of a referendum to the people, which resulted in his election by 96%. The government of the country is thus vested in an Iraqi Government, the King being advised by the British High Commissioner, while each Ministry has a British Adviser attached to it.

Every Liwa is administered by a native Mutasarrif, who is assisted by a British Inspector.

† For the position of Iraq vis-à-vis the League of Nations, see page lxii of Introduction.

On October 11th, 1922, the High Commissioner and the Naqib signed a treaty to regulate the relations between His Majesty's Government and the Government of Iraq. The Naqib resigned office in November, and a new cabinet, mainly composed of ministers who had previously served under him was formed under the Presidency of Abdul Muhsin Beg Sa'dun. In November, 1923, this Cabinet fell and was succeeded by one under the Presidency of Ja'far Pasha el 'Askari.

Under this Cabinet general elections were held and the Constituent Assembly met at the end of March, 1924, and sat until August 2, when it had completed the duties for which it was summoned, namely, to ratify the Treaty and pass the Organic and Electoral Laws. Ja'far Pasha then resigned and a new Cabinet was formed under Yasin Pasha al Hashimi. Preparations for the election of deputies to the National Assembly began in November.
