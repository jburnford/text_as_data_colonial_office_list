NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.*

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Mlanje.

It is bounded on the north by Tanganyika Territory, on the west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and according to the most recent survey has a total area of about 39,956 square miles.

It is divided into three Provinces, each under the control of a Provincial Commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into twenty districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 300 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies, notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shiré districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Wahenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shiré and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yoes at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled.

The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Sikhs arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

Constitution.

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Nairobi.

Climate and Products.

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shiré Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shiré Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shiré Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

Industry.

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, tobacco, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat and fibre.

Cotton has rapidly increased and the export reached 3,462,478 lbs. in 1916-17, but fell to 866,510 lbs. in 1917-18 owing to shipping restrictions; it rose again in 1918-19 to 2,670,834 lbs., and in 1919-20 dropped to 930,048 lbs. owing to market fluctuations. The export for the year ended 31st December, 1923, was 2,182,537 lbs. Tobacco shows a considerable increase, the export in 1916-17 being 4,304,124 lbs., but fell to 2,025,332 lbs. in 1917-18 from the same cause. In the year ended 31st December, 1923, 5,158,326 lbs. were exported. 98.8 per cent. of the export trade in 1923 was to the United Kingdom and British Colonies. Further development is greatly dependent on improved transport, which it is hoped will be provided in the form of a bridge across the Zambesi and a railway to Lake Nyasa.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition. 76.37 per cent. of the imports in 1923 came from the United Kingdom and British Colonies.

Population (31st December, 1923).

Europeans, 1,421; Asiatics, 613; Natives, 1,173,838.

Means of Communication.

A railway from Port Herald, on the Lower Shire, to Blantyre, 113 miles, via Chiromo and Luchenza, was built by the Shire Highlands Railway, under an agreement made in 1902 with the Nyasaland Government under which a subsidy was paid to the Railway. Subsequently the Central African Railway Co., Ltd., constructed a section, opened in 1915, from Chindio on the Zambesi to Port Herald, 61 miles, of which the first 45 are on Portuguese territory. Both lines are of 3ft. 6in. gauge. A railway of the same gauge was opened for traffic in April, 1922, by the Trans-Zambesia Railway Co., Ltd., which runs from Murraca on the south bank of the Zambesi to Dondo, the junction with the Mashonaland trunk line, about 20 miles from Beira (165 miles, all in Portuguese territory). The Nyasaland Government has had under consideration a railway from Luchenza to Lake Nyasa. There are eight British steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shiré between Chinde and the railway terminus. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being about 4,000. There are nine steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Mails to and from England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

Education.

There are no Government schools, and native education is in the hands of the missionary societies. A grant of 2,000l. was made by Government in 1923.

Currency and Banking.

By a Proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling.

Banking operations in the Protectorate are governed by "The Banking Ordinance, 1902."

Two Banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited, and The National Bank of South Africa, Limited; the former has a branch at Zomba, and agencies at other centres.

A Post Office Savings Bank has also been established in the Protectorate.
