MAURITIUS.

Situation and Area.

Mauritius is an island in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 18' and 57° 48' E. long., and 19° 50' and 20° 31' S. lat., distant 115 miles from Réunion, 934 miles from Seychelles, 1,300 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar. It comprises an area of about 720 square miles (nearly equal to Surrey), having an extreme length of 39 miles from north to south, and an extreme breadth of 29 miles from east to west.

The island is chiefly of volcanic formation but is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains but none of great height. The principal peaks are the Piton de la Riviere Noire (2,711 ft.), Pieter Both (2,690 ft.), and the Pouce (2,661 ft.). There are numerous rivers and streams; they flow generally through deep ravines and their course is broken by many small waterfalls and rapids. None of them are navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. The land rises gradually from the coasts, and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile and picturesque plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 to 1,500 feet. On this high and healthy tableland the temperature and climate are excellent.

History.

The island was discovered by the Portuguese between 1506 and 1528. Although neither the date of the event nor the name of the discoverer can be ascertained with accuracy, tradition has attributed its discovery to Pedro Mascarenhas. The island at that time went under the name of Santa Appollonia, which was later changed to Cerne. The Portuguese merely used the island as a port of call, without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch. In 1698 a Dutch fleet landed in the South-Eastern harbour of the island, to which its commander, Admiral Wybrandt Van Warwyk, gave the name of Mauritius, in honour of the Stadtholder, Prince Maurice of Nassau. For many years no attempt was made at colonisation, but from 1638 downwards petty settlements were established at various points, the seat of government being at the place known as Old Grand Port. The colony did not prosper, and was finally abandoned by the Dutch in 1710.

In 1716 the Island was formally taken possession of by the French, but was not actually occupied till 1721, when a small party of colonists were sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The island was then named Isle de France. This name was retained until the landing of the English in 1810, when the former name of Mauritius was restored. Of all the Governors of the island, the most celebrated was Mahé de Labourdonnais (1735-1746), "a man of eminent talents" (in the words of Lord Macaulay), who encouraged the cultivation of sugar-cane and introduced many other valuable plants. He was the real founder of the prosperity of the Isle de France.

In 1767, the French East India Company, having gone into liquidation, handed over the island to the Crown, Jean Daniel Dumas being appointed Governor General for the King, and Pierre Poivre, Intendant. Poivre was a man of great ability; he introduced into the colony cloves and nutmegs secretly obtained from the Dutch Sunda Archipelago. Having purchased
the ancient residence of the Company's Governors, at Monplaisir, he converted the grounds into a nursery where many useful plants introduced by him were cultivated. On his departure this property was sold to Government, the garden being entrusted to Poivre's friend, Nicolas Céré, under whose able management it became famous under the name of King's Gardens. It is now the Royal Botanical Gardens, Pamplemousses.

In 1771 an epidemic of smallpox caused many deaths among the slave population.

In 1790, at the outbreak of the French Revolution, a Colonial Assembly was elected, which for 13 years governed the island de facto.

In 1792 another very able Governor was sent out from France, Comte de Malartic, who during this troubled period managed to gain the affection of the whole community. In 1803, the Isle de France was taken charge of by General Decaen, appointed Captain General by Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul, with instructions to suspend the Colonial Assembly and the Isle de France's constitution for a period of ten years.

During the long war between England and France, the Isle de France was a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels, owing to the facility with which sorties were made from its harbour by French men-of-war and privateers; and in 1809 the British Government determined on its capture. The neighbouring islands of Rodrigues and Réunion were taken possession of and several naval engagements were fought to the credit of both navies. The most famous of these was the battle of the Isle de la Passe, fought in the bay of Grand Port on the 23rd and 24th August, 1810, between four English frigates and two French frigates, a corvette and a captured East Indiaman. The English lost the day, two of their ships having gone on shoals early in the engagement, but the great gallantry shown by both sides has rendered the fight memorable in the annals of the two navies.

A strong expeditionary force was then sent out from the three presidencies of India and the Cape. Twelve thousand troops under General Abercrombie were landed, and the island finally surrendered to Great Britain on December 3rd, 1810, the laws, religion, and customs of the inhabitants being guaranteed in the instrument of capitulation.

The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The first English Governor, Mr. (later Sir) R. T. Farquhar (1810-1823) gained a well-deserved popularity. During his tenure of office, on 25th September, 1816, the fourth part of the town of Port Louis was destroyed by a conflagration. On 28th February, 1818, the island was laid waste by a terrific cyclone, causing immense destruction to property.

In the year 1832, the Council of Government which was established on the 19th August, 1826, was abolished, and a Legislative Council, with half the members officially created. The oaths of office were taken by the new members on the 23rd January, 1832.

On the 1st April, 1835, the emancipation of slaves took place without disorder; but as this new class of free men refused employment as labourers the planters were obliged to resort to the introduction of labour from India which was finally authorised in 1842, under the supervision of an agent residing in India, and which continued, with temporary interruptions, until 1910.

In 1849, the Legislative Council voted the law constituting a municipal corporation for the town of Port Louis.

During the years 1854, 1856, 1861-62, epidemics of cholera prevailed, of which that of 1854 was the most severe, causing 7,850 deaths.

The year 1864 saw the opening of the North Railway Line from Port Louis to Pamplemousses, the Midland Line being inaugurated two years after.

In December, 1866, malaria broke out with great severity. During the year 1867, 31,768 persons died from fever, including 18,308 in Port Louis.

In 1868 and 1874, Mauritius was visited by severe cyclones. During the former two spans of the Grand River Railway Viaduct were brought down by the force of the wind. On the 29th April, 1892, one of the most violent cyclones ever recorded ruined a considerable portion of Port Louis, besides causing infinite havoc to buildings and crops. The death roll amounted to 1,232. In order to assist the planters and other owners of immovable property affected by the calamity, a loan of £600,000 was guaranteed by the Imperial Government.

On the 23rd of July, 1893, part of Port Louis was again destroyed by fire. At the end of the same year ocean telegraphic communication was opened.

In 1902, an outbreak of Surra caused great loss of draught animals, and mechanical means of transport had to be resorted to for the sugar plantations. A number of locomotives and traction engines were introduced, and a loan was raised to enable the planters to lay down tramways, and take other steps to provide for transport.

In 1909, a Royal Commission visited the Island to enquire into the administration and finances of the Colony.

During the Great War Mauritius suffered in no way by direct action on the part of the enemy. A number of volunteers proceeded to Europe for military service and a "Labour Battalion" was supplied for Mesopotamia.

The enormous rise in the price of sugar brought great prosperity to the Colony, and the gross value of the crop of 1920-1921 is estimated to have been approximately Rs. 250,000,000.

In 1921 investigations of the sanitary and health conditions were made by Dr Andrew Balfour, C.B., C.M.G., M.D. Of the minor works recommended, many have already been carried out while others are in progress.

In 1923 the Indian Government consented to the resumption of immigration of labourers from India consequent on the repeal of the penal clauses of the Labour Law of 1878 affecting labour.

General Description.

The permanent settled population of European race is greater in Mauritius than in any other tropical colony of its size. Many of the inhabitants are descendants of the ancient French noblesse. The higher and middle classes possess much intellectual culture.

Nine daily newspapers and ten other periodicals are published in the capital. The French language and a creole patois are spoken all over the island, English being used in the supreme court of justice. Debates in the Council of Government may take place in either language.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.
The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of 50,406 souls (census 1921). The harbour is one of the best in the East, and is sufficiently spacious to receive a large number of vessels. It possesses three graving docks.

The reconditioning of the Harbour and improvements thereto are being considered in the light of a report by Mr. Mitchell, of Messrs. Coode, Fitz-Maurice, Wilson & Mitchell. The Harbour is defended by Fort Adelaide (the citadel) and by Fort George. There are large barracks and military stores. The trade of the island passes almost entirely through Port Louis. The city has an elected municipal corporation, and raised in 1923 a revenue of Rs. 673,586, against an expenditure of Rs. 683,004. Its debt amounts to 110,160L.

The principal public edifices of Port Louis are the Government House, the Institute, the Roman Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, the Civil Hospital, the Town Hall, the theatre, and the public offices. There is a racecourse most beautifully situated in the Champ de Mars.

After Port Louis, the largest town is Curepipe, incorporated in 1890 (population 17,709, census of 1921), situated on the uplands in the Plaines Wilhems district.

In the district of Grand Port is the small town of Mahebourg (population 2,641, census of 1921), so called in honour of Mahé de Labourdonnais.

**Population.**

At the Census of 1921 the population of Mauritius (exclusive of the Dependencies, but including Military) was found to consist of:

- Persons of European, African, or mixed descent ........................................... 104,216
- Indo-Mauritians, i.e., persons of Indian descent, born in Mauritius .................. 248,468
- Other Indians ........................................................................................................ 17,506*
- Chinese .................................................................................................................. 6,745

Total ......................................................................................................................... 376,935

The total number of Indians was thus 265,974 or 70·5 per cent. of the total population.

The descendants of the immigrants from India—the Indo-Mauritians—now form the largest section of the population; they are steadily increasing in numbers. They are predominant in the domestic, commercial, and still more in the agricultural callings, and the amount of land held by them as small planters is rapidly growing.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Mauritius was altered in 1884-85. It now consists of a Governor, with an Executive Council of four ex-officio members, and a Legislative Council of twenty-seven members, eight being ex-officio, nine nominated by the Governor, and ten elected—two for the town of Port Louis, and one for each of the eight rural districts. At least one-third of the nominated members must be persons not holding any public office. Members are not paid; they may speak either in French or English. The number of registered electors on 31st December, 1923, was 7,950; the franchise qualification is ownership of immovables of annual value of Rs. 300, or movables worth Rs. 3,000, or payment of rent of Rs. 25 monthly.

* There is reason to believe that a number of old Indian immigrants (i.e., those whose contract has expired) have returned themselves as Indo-Mauritians.

or of license duty of Rs. 200 annually, or receipt of salary of Rs. 50 monthly. The session usually lasts from April to December.

The law is based on the Code Napoléon, and other French laws modified by Colonial Ordinances.

**Climate and Rainfall.**

From December to April is the hottest season in Mauritius, but it is comparatively cool during the remainder of the year. The average mean temperature of Port Louis is 77·1°, the average rainfall 38 inches and the relative humidity 71 per cent. The average mean temperature of Curepipe is 67·5°, the average rainfall 124 inches, and the relative humidity 87 per cent. The climate at Curepipe, from 1,700 to 1,900 feet above the sea, resembles that of the South of France or Italy. The cyclone season extends officially from December to the end of April, but cyclones occur in the Indian Ocean eastward of Mauritius, from the equator down to 30° S. latitude, in every month of the year, except August and September.

No cyclone had been recorded within 100 miles of Mauritius after the 29th April until, on May 26th, 1916, a centre passed about 80 miles eastward, causing considerable damage to crops in the east, south-east and south.

The mean rainfall in 1923 from 50 stations was 73·42 inches compared with an average of 76·43 inches.

During cyclones over 30 inches of rain have occasionally been registered in 24 hours.

**Water Supply.**

The Town of Port Louis is supplied by the Grand River N.W. and a reservoir was built at the end of the Champ de Mars by the Municipality. This source is not altogether satisfactory. It is proposed to provide Port Louis with Mare-aux-Vacoas water as advised by Mr. E. Mansergh, of Messrs. James Mansergh & Sons, who visited the Island in September and October, 1921. The erection of a chlorination plant with filter beds at Grand River, N.W., as recommended by them, to purify the water, is nearing completion.

The Mare aux Vacoas works were started by the Government in 1898, and were extended by the addition of a filtering plant. The whole of the district of Plaines Wilhems and a part of Moka are now supplied with pure water from these works and a small main was also laid to supply the Barracks and Fort in Port Louis and also the Government Establishments and soda water factories. These works have cost about 2,000,000 rupees and the revenue derived therefrom Rs. 89,631 in 1922-23 now exceeds the cost of the upkeep.

The water supply of other districts is under the control of other Local Boards and with the co-operation of the Government, works have been undertaken to distribute water from upland springs to the villages in the country districts; these works are now completed for some districts and in course of execution in others.

**Sewerage Scheme.**

The Port Louis sewerage and the sewage disposal are dealt with in Messrs. James Mansergh and Sons report. A 24" Outfall Sewer is now in course of construction.

**Irrigation.**

Important schemes have been in progress in recent years. A reservoir, with an area of 562 acres and a capacity of 416 million cubic feet has
been constructed at "La Ferme," in the District of Black River, and 3,337 acres of land are now under irrigation. A second scheme, the "La Nicoliere," in the District of Pamplemousses, is making good progress.

**Scenery.**

The famous tale of *Paul and Virginia*, by Bernardin de St. Pierre, an engineer officer in the service of France, who was stationed in the island towards the close of the 18th century, scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. Many of the forests have, however, been felled to make room for the cultivation of the sugar-cane, the staple industry of the colony. In the remaining woods deer abound (being carefully preserved) and afford good sport; there are also partridges, quails, hares, and wild ducks in several parts of the island. The far-famed Botanical Gardens of Pamplemousses contain many rare and valuable plants and flowers.

**Railways.**

There are seven lines of railway, all owned and worked by Government, viz.: (1) The North line, from Port Louis to the sea coast village of Grand River South-east. Its length is 31 miles, and its course is approximately parallel to the northern coast line of the island. (2) The Montagne Longue branch from Terre Rouge station on the North Line to the village of Montagne Longue; its length is 34 miles. (3) The Midland line, beginning at Port Louis and running across the island to the sea coast town of Mahébourg on the other side; its length is 36·3 miles, with a summit level of 1,822 feet at Curepipe; the gradient in many places is 1 in 27. It is proposed to double the 16 miles of this line between Curepipe and Port Louis. Of this, 4 miles have actually been doubled and opened for traffic. (4) The Moka-Flacq line from the Rose Hill station on the Midland line to Rivière Séche station on the North line; length 26·2 miles. (5) Savanne branch from Rose-belle station on the Midland line to the sea coast town of Souillac at the southern extremity of the island; its length is 10·90 miles. (6) Black River branch, from Richelieu on the Midland line to Tamarin, distance 12·75 miles. (7) Rivière du Poste to Mexico and Richebois, length 24 miles. All the above are of standard gauge, 4' 8½" except the 7th which is 75 centimetres (2' 6"). The total number of miles of railway now open is 119·65 of standard gauge and 24 of 2' 6" gauge, the total cost up to date being about 2,245,654L or Rs. 33,684,811 (£1 = Rs. 15). The receipts in 1923 were Rs. 5,103,543 (including traffic done for other Government departments), and expenditure, Rs. 5,489,892, not including the charge on account of Railway Loans.

**Religion.**

The Christian Churches are assisted by State grants. According to the census of 1921, the Roman Catholics numbered 117,491, and the Protestants about 3,400, including Dependencies and Military. The Roman Catholics received in 1923-24 Government aid amounting to Rs. 142,016 and the Protestants Rs. 54,091.

**Education.**

The system of education had been remodelled by Ordinance No. 33 of 1899, which repealed all former enactments. This Ordinance was amended in some important respects by Ordinance No. 35 of 1913.

Under the Education Ordinance of 1899, a Department of Public Instruction was created under a "Director of Public Instruction."

This system remained in force until it was superseded by the Education Consolidation Ordinance of 1919, under which the Department of Public Instruction was replaced by a Royal College Department and a Schools Department, the post of Director of Public Instruction being abolished. The Rector is the Head of the Royal College Department; and the Superintendent of Schools of the Schools' Department.

The Royal College provides for the Secondary Education of Boys. A Committee styled the "Royal College Committee" is annually appointed by the Governor to advise in the framing of Regulations and to act as a consultative body. It consists of the Rector as Chairman, and of six members chosen by the Governor.

The Schools' Department provides for Primary, Secondary, and Technical and Industrial Education:

1. Primary Education is carried on through a system of Government Schools and of Grant-in-aid Denominational Schools, the latter under the immediate control of local managers.
2. Secondary Education is provided by means of a system of Grant-in-aid schools for boys and girls.
3. As regards Technical and Industrial Education, provision is made for the training of students in Engineering (Mechanical and Civil), in Horticulture and Woodwork, and for the training of students as Teachers. A consultative committee styled the "Schools Committee," similar to that of the Royal College, is annually appointed by the Governor. It consist of 10 members: five members are nominated by the Primary and Secondary Grant-in-aid Schools and four are chosen by the Governor, with the Superintendent of Schools as Chairman.
4. A sum of Rs. 500,000 has been set aside from the Colony's Surplus Balances as a "Scholarship Fund." The interest on this amount will be devoted annually to provide further facilities, in the shape of scholarships and educational grants, for young Mauritians in the Government service and on leaving school to pursue their studies and obtain higher technical qualifications.

**Higher Education.**

On the books of the Royal College on the 31st December, 1923, there were 450 pupils.

**Primary Education.**

There were in 1923—

| Number. | Pupils. |
|---------|--------|
| Government schools | 57 | 13,321 |
| Grant schools | 94 | 18,280 |

Total | 151 | 31,601 |

**Total Number of Pupils.**

The relative numbers according to religion are shown by the following percentages:

| Church of England | 2% |
| Roman Catholic | 53,, |
| Other Christian denominations | 1,, |
| Mohammedan | 12,, |
| Hindoos and others | 32,, |
The total expenditure on education in 1922-23 amounted to Rs. 1,209,999. There are about 300 masters, mistresses, assistants, and monitors and monitoresses employed in Government and Grant Schools. Of the pupils in the aided schools 59° per cent. are Roman Catholics, 2° per cent. belong to the Church of England, and 1° per cent. to other Christian denominations. Four Hindoo and two Moslem schools are also assisted.

Agricultural Education.

To facilitate higher agricultural education, a small Agricultural College has been established. Regular delivery of courses of lectures on Agricultural Science is being made to Primary School Teachers by the Department of Agriculture.

Communications.

Mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes, starting from Marseilles, maintain an irregular service via the Suez Canal, and the Union-Castle line provides a service via the Cape of Good Hope.

The British India Steam Navigation Company runs an irregular service between Colombo and Mauritius. There is frequent communication by both sailing and steam vessels with India, Australia, Madagascar, Natal, Réunion, &c.

The Imperial Wireless Station at Rose-belle, which was closed on the 30th June, 1922, has been taken over by the Government from the Admiralty for a term of 21 years, from 1st June, 1923. Telegraphic and telephonic communication is established along and beyond the railway, the total length of line being 67½ miles of telegraph* and 161½ of telephone; and cable communication through a branch office of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company with Europe, via Seychelles, Zanzibar, and Aden, was opened in November, 1893. Through rate: United Kingdom to Mauritius, 3s. per word; and from Mauritius to United Kingdom, Rs. 1·50.

There are in Mauritius the General Post Office in the city of Port Louis, and 61 branch post offices in the rural districts, 61 money order offices, 54 telegraph and 7 telephone offices. In the island of Rodrigues there is one post office at Port Mathurin. There is no post office on any other of the Dependencies. The rates of postage as from 1st January, 1922, are:

| Letters. Newspapers. |

* Including Block Telegraph for the Railway.

Commerce.

The island produces barely one-tenth of the food required for its inhabitants and almost all agricultural enterprise is devoted to the production of exports.

The chief exports are sugar, rum, molasses, spice, vanilla, aloe-fibre, oil, copra, &c. Oxen are imported from Madagascar and Rodrigues, and food-stuffs from India.

The imports consist mainly of grain (rice, wheat, &c.), cotton manufactures, wine, coals, hardware, and manure. Efforts are being made to establish a tobacco industry. About 88 per cent. of the value of the exports consists of shipments of sugar. In 1923 the weight of sugar exported was 223,051,061 kilos., with an estimated value of Rs. 67,227,682. The value of the rum exported was Rs. 20,168; that of vanilla, Rs. 120; that of aloe-fibre, Rs. 164,112; that of cocoanut oil, Rs. 169,931. The number of vessels registered at Port Louis is now 25, of a total tonnage of 7,109.

Currency and Banking.

The Mauritius Commercial Bank has establishments in the Colony, the total amount of deposits on 31st Dec., 1923, being Rs. 26,782,584, with paid up capital of Rs. 2,000,000.

The Bank of Mauritius (Limited) (now Mercantile Bank of India) was established in October, 1894, with paid up capital of 125,550L, and opened in Mauritius in Dec., 1894. Total deposits up to end of 1923, Rs. 13,193,034. The business of that bank was taken over by the Mercantile Bank of India Limited on the 3rd May, 1916. The total paid up capital is now 1,050,000L.

The National Bank of South Africa has opened branches in the Island since 1919. The paid up capital being 2,075,500L, and the total amount of deposits on 31st December, 1923, Rs. 3,243,516.

A Government savings bank was established in 1837. The total deposits during the year ended 30th June, 1923, amounted to Rs. 2,066,647. The sum standing to the credit of depositors at the end of June, 1923, was Rs. 5,590,934.

All accounts are kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is the currency of the island. A Government note issue was re-established in 1876, the notes being legal tender except at the office of issue. The average circulation for the year 1922-23 was Rs. 19,175,688.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Dependencies.

The dependencies of Mauritius comprise a large number of islands scattered over the Indian Ocean.

Rodrigues, the most important, is situated in latitude S. 19° 44' and longitude E. 63° 34', and is 344 nautical miles from Mauritius. The island which has an area of 42 sq. miles, about 26,000 acres, is 18 miles long by 7 miles broad, and is surrounded by coral reefs, extending in some places 5 or 6 miles from the shore. It is under the administration of a magistrate, who takes his instructions from the Governor of Mauritius. Laws for the island are made in the form of regulations framed by the Governor of Mauritius in Executive Council.

The population (census 1921) was 6,684. The birth rate in 1921 was 39·3 and the death rate 19·1 per 1,000. Cable communication, through a branch of the Eastern and South African Telegraph Company, was opened on 16th May, 1902.
The island, which is volcanic, mountainous, and in some parts well wooded, is beautiful and picturesque in the extreme. The highest land is 1,760 feet above the level of the sea, and may be seen in clear weather at a distance of 10 or 12 leagues. The temperature differs little from that of Mauritius, although the breezes are stronger and hurricanes more frequent and severe. The climate is healthy. The principal industries are fishing and the rearing of cattle and goats, for which latter the pasturage is excellent. The soil is good: cotton, coffee, tobacco, maize, beans, and vanilla grow luxuriantly; a trained officer has of late (1921) been appointed Agricultural Superintendent in view of the agricultural development of Rodrigues. The wild guinea fowl and partridges likewise the deer and wild pigs, which used to be plentiful, have almost disappeared.

The value of the imports in 1923 was Rs. 580,380. The exports of the island produce in 1923 were valued at Rs. 436,098. The people are all peasant proprietors and there is abundance of food.

The principal exports at present are beans, maize, salt-fish, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, tobacco-leaf and acacia seeds.

Communication with Rodrigues is maintained by H.M.C.S. "Secunder" and occasional sailing vessels.

Diego Garcia (population, 445, census 1921), the most important of the Oil Islands group, consists of four islands, at four days' steaming from Mauritius, the chief one being about 30 miles in length, extending in an irregular horseshoe shape, and embracing between its extremities three minor islets. It is a coral atoll, fifteen miles by six and a half, nowhere over ten feet high, but forming a spacious bay, roomy enough for large vessels to enter, being fifteen miles in length from end to end, and from two to five miles in breadth.

Diego Garcia is situated at 7° 20' latitude S. and 72° 26' longitude E., on the straight line between the entrance to the Red Sea and Cape Leeuwin. In 1886 it was placed under the jurisdiction of a magistrate, with a small force of police from Mauritius, which was, however, withdrawn in 1888.

The population of the smaller Dependencies, according to the 1921 census, was 1,773.

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 42,000 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom. Population, 259,358.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Hudson's Strait to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound, the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,300 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, amongst the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Hebron, Ramah, and Killinek. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norseman Lief, son of Eric the Red, in A.D. 1,000, and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863 and again in 1909. During the summer months several Justices of the Peace are upon the coast.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise this island, but were not successful. In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert formerly took possession of the Island in the name of Queen Elizabeth, and it was incorporated into the realm of England. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the southeast part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieuc, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they were allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right was an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it did not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1886 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1893, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (see Cd. 1962). The arrangement has been of great benefit to the Colony, since it removed an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Dried cod is the largest export (1,592,046 qts. in 1922); other large exports are herrings, lobsters, salmon, iron, fish oils, seal skins, and timber. Copper is worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The establishment of large and well-equipped paper mills at Grand Falls, in the interior, by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, has opened up a very large industry. The paper and paper pulp is shipped to the United Kingdom and used in the principal London printing offices, while, during 1917, some of the publishing houses in the United States have been supplied. A model town has been laid out which is well lighted, watered, and drained. It is very picturesquely situated, and is on the line of the Reid
Newfoundland Company's railway through the interior, while a private line of rail connects the works with Botwood, the principal port on the Exploits for summer shipments.

The Albert Reed Company, of London, have completed a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about nine miles from Grand Falls, where pulp is being manufactured for English mills. This company have also installed machinery for the manufacture of paper. At Lomond, in Bonne Bay, on the West Coast, the St. Lawrence Lumber and Pulp Co. are erecting large mills for the manufacture of lumber and pulp, and propose to erect mills for the making of paper. At Glovertown, on the Terra Nova River, Bonavista Bay, a company is now installing a plant for the manufacture of sulphite pulp. Both these companies will operate on a large scale.

The Humber development scheme, which has recently been launched by the Newfoundland Power and Paper Co., Ltd., with the full sanction of the Newfoundland Government, will utilize water power capable of developing hydro-electric energy of 250,000 horse power, and will involve the employment of more than 1,500 people, and the making of a new town at Comer Brook of about 7,000 people in the western portion of the Island. The mills will have a producing capacity of 400 tons of finished paper daily. Apart from the power required for the mills, there will be a surplus sufficient for all local or domestic purposes on the whole of the west coast, and also for the large mining areas in that part.

The scheme has received support from both the British and Newfoundland Governments, the British Government guaranteeing £2,000,000 under the Trade Facilities Act.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1920-21 was 1,363,792 quintals, value $13,334,954; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Bank of Commerce have been opened in St. John's, branches of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace and in twenty-two other towns; branches of the Bank of Montreal at Carbonear, Bay of Islands, Grand Falls, and four other places; and seven branches of the Royal Bank of Canada at various points.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1895) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4 36¢ to the pound sterling.

In the Government Savings Bank deposits in 1923 were $1,927,456.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $525,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance from Whitbourne of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, via Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,146,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, Carbonear, and Burnt Bay are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. Other branch lines have been constructed to Bonavista, Hearts' Content, Grate's Cove and Trepassey, in all about 189 miles. By the transinsular railway regular connection is made with the continent thrice weekly, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamer "Kyle" which makes the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 4,591 miles of telegraph lines and 965 miles of telephones. The Government cable, laid in 1906 between Port-aux-Basques and Canso in Nova Scotia, gives quick communication with both America and Europe. This cable was sold to the Commercial Cable Company in 1922. The Anglo-American cables start for Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable landed at St. John's, the Direct (now "Imperial") cable at Harbor Grace, and the Western Union at Bay Roberts, and all connect with both Europe and America. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The Furness-Withy Line of steamers runs between Liverpool and St. John's, and between St. John's and Halifax, making about sixteen trips each way annually, monthly in winter, and at intervals of about three weeks in summer. The south and west coast has a weekly steamer service from Placentia, and also a fortnightly service per steamer from St. John's. Two steamers make trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer at intervals of eight to ten days, and another makes fortnightly trips between St. John's and Cape Norman in the north of the island, calling at all the important intermediate settlements. Smaller steamers ply on the five great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, 1st 1 oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|------------|
| In St. John's     | 2 cents    | under 4 oz. |
| Within Colony     | 3 cents    | 1 cent.     |

| To United Kingdom and Colonies | 1 cent for 2 oz. |
|--------------------------------|------------------|

| Europe and St. Pierre, Miquelon South America, etc. | 6 cents for 1st oz. 3 cents per succeeding oz. |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| To United States | 4 cents | 1 , ditto. |
|------------------|---------|-----------|
Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's is about 42°, the extreme range being from 0° to 81°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1913 was 49 inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Beothuck tribe.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1916 and its Amendment Act of 1920. By the new Act the Central Administration is vested in the Department of Education, presided over by the Minister of Education who is a member of the Executive Council. The education policy of the new Government provides for the establishment of an up-to-date Normal School and the appointment of 11 District School Supervisors. There are three Superintendents of Education belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican and the Methodist Denominations. There were in 1921, 1,107 schools with 56,599 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and a small vote of $4,767 was passed for technical education. In 1910 a special grant of $100,000 was made for the erection, re-modelling and equipment of school buildings in places outside the city of St. John's.

In 1893 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature $14,425.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 37,047 inhabitants. Other towns of importance are Harbour Grace, with a population of 3,825; Bonavista, 4,052; Carbonear, 3,320; Twillingate, 3,217; Grand Falls, 3,769; Burin, 2,763, and Bay Roberts, 2,168. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1924—63,383 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500£. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $150 each (President $250) per session. Members of the Assembly receive $750 each per session. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a Mayor and 6 Councillors elected under the provisions of the Municipal Act, 1921.

NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the South, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Dominion: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°46' S. lat., 176°177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long, and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island and adjacent islets is 44,131 square miles, of the South Island 58,120 square miles, of Stewart Island 662 square miles, of Chatham Islands 372 square miles, and other islands, including the Cook Islands, 577 square miles, a total area of 103,862 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. long., and 33° and 53° S. lat., were annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, was annexed to New Zealand. These are a group of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macauay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Dominion to include the group as well as Savage (Niue) Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of New Zealand are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Rarotonga, Mangaias, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mitiaro, Mauke, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avaramu), Savage (Niue), Pukapuka (Danger), Rakasa, Manahiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suwarrow.

An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

The principal Allied and Associated Powers, assembled at Versailles, decided that the islands of Western Samoa should be assigned under mandate to New Zealand; and a mandate was issued by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920, in favour of New Zealand. The group which lies about 400 miles N.E. from Fiji contains several islands, of which Savaii and Upolu are the largest. The total area is some 1,250 square miles.

It was also decided that the phosphate island of Nauru (Pleasant Island), lying in 0°33' south latitude, and 166°56' east longitude, should be administered by New Zealand conjointly with the United Kingdom and Australia.

By Order-in-Council of 30th July, 1923, the Government of the Ross Dependency, comprising the coasts of the Ross Sea and adjacent islands and territories, was transferred to the Governor-General of New Zealand.
Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the average death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (50°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington in 1923 was 47° from 77° in summer to 30° in winter. The rainfall varied from a mean for the year 1923 of 22 inches on the east coast, to 93 inches on the west coast of the South Island, and from 42 inches on the east coast, to 62 inches on the west coast, and 41 inches in the interior of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 10 years 1914–1923 was 24·14 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·86. The birth rate in 1923 was 21·94 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9·03. New Zealand has the lowest rate of infantile mortality in the world, a fact attributed to such matters as climate, virility of race, comparative absence of large industrial undertakings, and partly to legislative and educative measures. The average rate for the last ten years was 47·80 per 1,000 births, and the rate for the year 1923 was 43·80.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1921, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 52,751, almost all of whom dwelt in the North Island. Contrary to the results found in other civilised countries the Maoris in New Zealand are steadily increasing, the estimated number at the 30th June, 1924, being 54,020.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1860.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and a constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict. cap. 72. By that Act New Zealand was divided into six provinces, afterwards increased to ten, but subsequently reduced to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers were now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Dominion into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1862, consisting of the Governor (now Governor-General), a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor-General is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Dominion for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor-General, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments were made tenable for seven years only. Provision has now been made for an elective Legislative Council to consist of 40 European members and not more than 3 Maori members, the latter to be appointed by the Governor-General. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector, male or female, is qualified to become a member (the Women's Parliamentary Rights Act, passed in 1919, gives women the right to be elected to either house). The House of Representatives now consists of 90, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of £15l. a year, payable monthly. Members of the House of Representatives receive £60l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows.—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Dominion and one month in an electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote and are eligible for election as well as men.
The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the New Zealand Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Dominion is divided into 118 municipalities and 129 counties; the latter being subdivided into 42 road districts and 71 town districts, besides River, Drainage, Water Supply, Tramway, Local Railway, Harbour, Hospital, and Electric Power Districts. For the year ended 31st March, 1923, the total receipts of the above local authorities amounted to £17,921,406l. and their expenditure to £15,695,507l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to £36,069,382l., exclusive of £5,262,400l. outstanding in loans from the New Zealand Government State Advances Office, and also of £2,341,667l. inscribed by the Treasury under the now-repealed Local Bodies' Loans Acts and outstanding at 1st Feb., 1923. The net indebtedness on these various classes of loans was at the same dates £32,144,942l., £4,770,135l. and £1,244,969l. respectively.

Education.

A Government system of primary education was established in 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of nine Education Boards, and of School Committees with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of primary schools (called "public schools"), 2,566; scholars on roll, 214,778. Primary education is free, secular, and compulsory. In addition for native (Maori) education there are 124 village schools maintained by the Government and under the control of the Minister, nine Native mission schools, and eleven denominational boarding schools. Scholars on roll of village schools, 6,186 (including 734 Europeans); on the roll of mission schools, 367; and on roll of boarding schools, 493 of whom 124 hold Government free places. Net cost of native school education in 1923-24 was £72,495l. In the Chatham Islands four schools are maintained, and there are three schools, under the control of the Cook Islands Administration, in the Cook Islands. During the year 1923, 294 private primary schools with a roll number of 26,010 were registered under the Education Act. A School Journal providing suitable reading matter is provided by the Department and issued free to all children in Government schools. A comprehensive system of physical education and schemes of dental and medical inspection are in operation in the primary schools, the latter now being under the control of the Department of Health. Four training colleges make provision for the training of teachers, the roll number for the last quarter of 1923 being 1,202. There is also provision for training classes at smaller centres. The number of adult primary school teachers in 1923 was 5,656, pupil teachers 511, and the number of probationers 850. The total expenditure by the Government under the head of primary education was for 1923-24, £2,265,392l. There is a system of superannuation for teachers giving an annuity of one-sixtieth of the average of the final three years' salary for each year of service.

Secondary education is provided at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools, the numbers of operative schools under each heading in 1923 being 37, 68, and 14 respectively, with a total roll number as follows:—Secondary schools, 11,619; district high schools (secondary departments), 2,818; technical high schools, 5,064. In addition 27 private secondary schools were registered under the Education Act, the roll number being 2,134. In scholarships and free places at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical high schools 18,103 pupils received free secondary education. Provision is made for manual instruction in both primary and secondary schools, cookery, dressmaking, woodwork, elementary agriculture, dairywork, and the various branches of elementary science being included in the subjects taken. Instruction of a technical or vocational character is provided at a large number of technical schools and classes, besides the technical high schools mentioned above, the courses of instruction followed being commercial and general, industrial, domestic, agriculture, and art. The total number of students attending such classes in 1923 was 13,063, of whom 4,858 received free education.

For higher education there are four endowed colleges affiliated to the University of New Zealand, and each specializes in one or more directions. At Dunedin the special subjects are mining, medicine, dental, veterinary, and domestic science; at Christchurch, engineering and technical science; at Wellington, law and science; at Auckland, commerce engineering and mining. There is an agricultural college at Lincoln possessing a large endowment and an experimental farm of a very complete character. The number of students on the books of the University Colleges was, in 1923, 4,202, of which number 1,611 or 39 per cent. were receiving free education. The total expenditure by the Government on university education in 1923-24 was £121,661l.

The care of neglected and delinquent children and of orphans is undertaken by the Education Department, which adopts the boarding-out system, combined with various residential institutions serving for the classification of those who have to be kept under discipline. Of the 3,692 children on the rolls of industrial schools and receiving homes only 260 were in residence in Government or private industrial schools and reformatories, and 1,868 were boarded out with foster parents. The rest were at service, with friends, on probation, etc. 227 children admitted to probation were also under the Department's supervision. On the grounds of moral degeneracy or unfitness in the public interest to be free from overnight detention beyond the age of 21 may be extended by a magistrate from time to time, thus securing life-long control where necessary. Expenditure for 1923-24, £4,770l.

Maintained by the Government are special schools for the deaf and the feeble-minded. Deaf: 129 pupils cost the Government £5,756l.; feeble-minded: 216 pupils cost £7,933l. net. The education of blind, deaf, feeble-minded and epileptic children is compulsory from six to twenty-one years of age, subject to exemption by the Minister. The feeble-minded can be kept permanently under restraint, each case being judicially reviewed at intervals of not more than four years. A School for the Blind at Auckland is subsidized by the Government.

The infant life protection system which provides for the supervision of infants under six years who are maintained apart from their parents for monetary consideration is also
administered by the Education Department. There are 684 infants under supervision in 565 licensed homes. The death rate is under 1 per cent.

For the financial year 1923-24 the total cost to the Education Department of the services mentioned above was £3,247,130l.

**Population.**

The population of New Zealand on 17th April, 1921, was found by the census to be 1,218,913 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 52,751, and Cook and other Pacific Islands (13,269). The estimated population of New Zealand (including Maoris but excluding residents of Cook and other Pacific Islands), on 30th June, 1924, was 1,349,826.

The population of the chief towns on the 29th April, 1906; 2nd April, 1911; 15th October, 1916, and 17th April, 1921, was as follows:

| Year | City and Suburbs Wellington | City and Suburbs Dunedin | City and Suburbs Auckland | City and Suburbs Christchurch |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1906 | 58,563                      | 36,070                   | 37,736                    | 49,928                     |
|      | 63,807                      | 56,020                   | 82,101                    | 67,878                     |
|      | 64,372                      | 41,529                   | 40,536                    | 53,116                     |
|      | 70,729                      | 64,237                   | 102,676                   | 80,193                     |

**Industry.**

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Dominion up to 31st December, 1923, was valued at £90,863,040l. The wool exported in 1923 amounted to 217,566,091 lbs., valued at £10,904,688l. In 1886 it amounted to 2,559,618 lbs., valued at £146,070l. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at £19,339l., had developed an export for 1889 of 656,822 cwt., valued at £783,374l., in 1898 to 903,836 cwt., valued at £1,085,167l., in 1898, 1,551,773 cwt., valued at £1,698,750l., in 1903, 2,378,650 cwt., valued at £3,197,043l., in 1908, 2,120,303 cwt., valued at £3,188,515l., in 1913, 2,578,693 cwt., valued at £4,449,933l., in 1918, 2,036,904 cwt., valued at £4,957,576l., and in 1923, 3,043,910 cwt., valued at £9,012,627l. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1924, was: horses, 330,430 against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 3,563,497 against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 23,775,776 against 11,704,853 in 1874. The total area of occupied holdings over one acre in extent in 1924 was 43,872,564 acres; 173,864 acres were in wheat (for threshing only), having a total yield of 4,174,637 bushels. Of the area under oats for all purposes 63,842 acres were threshed, giving a total yield of 1,964,511 bushels.

*In each case the Urban Areas include a greater area than the former "City and Suburbs." These figures are therefore to that extent incomparable with those for the 1911 and previous censuses.*

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton, Napier, Nelson, Wellington and Timaru are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1923, 555 vessels registered, of 100,682 (net) tons in the aggregate. Many of the larger vessels formerly on the register were transferred to the London register to take advantage of the Imperial War rates.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware and machinery, sugar, tea, tobacco, alcohol, books, stationery, motor vehicles, drugs and chemicals, and oils; and they are obtained almost entirely from the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, Canada, Ceylon, Japan and Pacific islands.

**Banking and Currency.**

The following banks have branches, two are New Zealand Institutions, in the Dominion:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, Bank of Australasia, and Commercial Bank of Australia (Limited). The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand for the year 1923 (average of four quarters), was £49,039,482l., and of their note circulation £6,593,068l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Dominion, having on 31st March, 1924, 846 branches; the amount deposited therein at that date was £46,098,421l. The private savings banks number five, and the total amount to credit of depositors at March 31st, 1924, was £5,216,579l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling, but the issues of the six banks carrying on in the Dominion have been declared legal tender until 10th January, 1926.

**Government Insurance Department.**

**Life Branch.**

This department commenced to transact business in March, 1870. It is under the management of the Government Insurance Commissioner, and is conducted almost exactly on the same principles as those generally adopted by private mutual life offices.

It has canvassing agents, and pays its own expenses including postage and taxes.

The premiums originally adopted by the Department were extremely low, and were not framed to provide bonuses. Even with these small premiums, however, the methods of management, assisted by the low mortality of New Zealand, produced surpluses from the beginning. It was, however, quickly realized that it would be necessary to provide substantial bonuses to policyholders in order to enable the Department to compete successfully with the private offices. The rates of premium were therefore raised, but although higher than formerly, these rates are on the whole considerably lower than those charged by the private offices transacting business in the Dominion. Besides its low premiums the Department makes a feature of its liberal and sympathetic administration.

Profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policyholders themselves and are distributed triennially in the form of compound reversionary bonuses. The basis employed in the actuarial valuation—the most stringent in use by Australasian Offices, namely, the OM. (British Offices) Tables with interest at 3% — indicates the strength of the Department and when taken in conjunction with the fact that the rate of interest earned on the funds is over 5½% constitutes the
best possible augury of future bonus prospects. The figures for the last ten years in respect of new business, premium income, funds, and total business in force are as follows:

| Year | New Business | Premium Income | Funds end of year | Business in Force |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1914 | 1,116,353    | 384,776        | 5,033,884         | 13,797,975        |
| 1915 | 1,041,167    | 371,784        | 5,089,869         | 14,290,945        |
| 1916 | 883,398      | 373,843        | 5,202,898         | 14,269,372        |
| 1917 | 784,600      | 383,727        | 5,199,320         | 14,188,774        |
| 1918 | 1,252,538    | 399,672        | 5,191,746         | 14,770,943        |
| 1919 | 1,617,796    | 411,307        | 5,354,904         | 15,546,744        |
| 1920 | 1,659,660    | 436,816        | 5,842,662         | 16,269,310        |
| 1921 | 1,631,250    | 460,302        | 5,726,356         | 17,279,734        |
| 1922 | 1,286,609    | 473,141        | 5,922,825         | 17,449,101        |
| 1923 | 1,581,722    | 489,171        | 6,222,485         | 17,906,612        |

It will be seen from these figures that the Department would in point of the magnitude of its operations take high rank even among the Insurance Companies of England.

Accident Branch.

The Accident Branch of the Government Insurance Department was opened in 1901, for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance. General accident business is undertaken, but the branch was opened more especially with a view to relieve employers of labour of the liability imposed upon them by "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900." This Act greatly extended the liability of employers, and gave to a workman the right of compensation for all injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, not attributable to his own serious and wilful misconduct.

This liability has been extended by subsequent Acts, the principal amendments being in 1908, 1920 and 1922. Under the Workers' Compensation Act, 1922 (mainly a consolidating enactment) which came into force on the 1st April, 1923, the scale of compensation is as follows:

(a.) Where death results from the injury and the workman leaves dependants wholly dependent upon his earnings, the compensation is one hundred and fifty-six times his average weekly earnings, but not to be less than 200£., nor to exceed 750£.

(b.) If the dependants are only partially dependent upon the workman's earnings, the compensation is to be such sum as is reasonable and proportionate to the injury to such dependants, but not exceeding the amount payable under paragraph (a).

(c) In either of the above cases the employer is also liable for medical and burial expenses not exceeding 50£., and an amount not exceeding this sum can be claimed where there are no dependants.

(d) Where a workman is totally incapacitated for work, he is entitled to a weekly payment of 58½% of his average weekly earnings, but the weekly compensation is not to be less than 1£. in cases where the worker's earnings at the time of the accident are not less than 30s. per week. Persons employed otherwise than by way of manual labour, whose earnings exceed 400£. a year, are excluded from the benefits of the Act and the maximum weekly payment is limited to 3£. 15s.

(e) Where the workman is partially incapacitated only, the compensation is 58½% of the loss of wages.

(f) In addition to the compensation for incapacity medical or surgical expenses are allowed, not exceeding 1£.

Weekly payments are not to extend over a longer period than six years, and the aggregate amount is not to exceed 750£.

The Department's policies cover the full liability of an employer to his workmen under the Workers' Compensation Act, and also suitably protect him against liability under the Deaths by Accident Compensation Act, and the Common Law.

Policies protecting mortgagees from loss through the charge of an injured workman taking precedence of a mortgage are issued at premiums varying from 1s. per cent. of the mortgage for small mortgages to 6d. per cent. for large mortgages.

Personal accident policies are also issued securing amounts for accidental death and permanent total or partial disablement, and weekly allowances during temporary disablement, whether caused by accident or sickness.

The premium income and claims of the Accident Branch during the last ten years have been as follows:

| Year ending 31st December | Premium Income |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| 1914                      | 22,090          |

| 1923                      | 35,268          |

State Fire Insurance.

In the year 1903 was passed an Act "to establish a State Fire Insurance Office and to make other provisions for the insurance and protection of insurable property in New Zealand against loss or damage by fire."

The statute provided for the establishment of an office to be administered by a General Manager appointed by the Governor-General, and for the necessary staff.

Provision is made for the constitution of a Board, to consist of the General Manager, the Minister of Finance, the Government Insurance Commissioner, and two other persons (not being in the Civil Service) appointed by the Governor-General. The latter hold office for two years, with eligibility for re-appointment.

The Department opened for business with branches and agencies throughout the Dominion in January, 1905. The opening of the office resulted in a reduction in the rates then current of 33½ per cent. on dwellings and the less hazardous risks, and of 10 per cent. on all others. A rebate of 15% in all cases was given for the year 1923-24. This rebate has been reduced to 10% for 1924-25. The total accumulated profit made to the end of December, 1923, was 381,847£., and the net income and net losses for each of the ten years to that date have been as follows:
Net Income, less Re-insurances.

Public Works.

All the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under road boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1924, there were 3,053 miles of Government and 119 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 312 miles of Government railway under construction. The construction of new lines and the extension of existing ones has proceeded steadily in recent years but has necessarily been held up during the last few years on account of the war.

The expenditure on the 3,053 miles of opened Government railways has been 41,399,427l., or an average of 13,560l. a mile. This includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1923-1924 was 6,984,211l., and the working expenses 5,403,766l. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraph and inter-urban telephone circuits there are 12,954 miles of line and 52,910 miles of wire. There are 334 Morse telegraph offices, 1,961 telephone offices, and 327 telephone exchanges, the latter having 106,764 connections with 7,605 miles of line and 269,421 miles of wire. 371 coin-in-the-slot telephones are in use.

The conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working is being effected at a number of exchanges where the existing manual systems cannot be economically extended. There are now 16 automatic exchanges in operation and 14 in course of installation. Extensions to telegraph, toll and telephone exchange systems are being proceeded with in all parts of the Dominion to meet the increasing demands for telegraph and telephone facilities. There are seven submarine cables, connecting the two islands of New Zealand; two Wellington-Sydney, one Auckland-Sydney, and one Auckland-Brisbane, via Norfolk Island, connecting the Dominion with Australia, and one connecting Auckland with Suva.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December, 1902. The laying of the Auckland-Suva cable was completed on the 25th August, 1923.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was 3s. a word, Government messages 1s. 6½d., and Press 1s. a word. These rates have since been reduced by 4d. per word for ordinary messages, and 2½d. per word for Government messages. The charge for press messages has also been reduced to 7½d. per word and a deferred rate for press instituted at 4½d. per word.

An ordinary deferred telegram system has been instituted with a maximum delay of 24 hours at half the charge for ordinary cable messages. Two other classes of cheap cable messages known respectively as Daily Letter Telegrams (which are subject to 48 hours delay during transmission) and Week-End Letter Telegrams are exchanged with the United Kingdom and Canada. The rates are as follows:

**Daily Letter Telegrams**

| Per Word | Min. Charge |
|----------|------------|
| United Kingdom | 8½d. | 13s. 4½d. |
| Canada | 6½d. | 10s. 0½d. |

**Week-End Telegrams**

| Per Word | Min. Charge |
|----------|------------|
| United Kingdom | 7½d. | 11s. 8½d. |
| Canada | 5¼d. | 8s. 0½d. |

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is about 1,700 a day by both routes.

In the year ending 31st March, 1924, excluding the value of Government messages, the telegraph revenue was 1,542,365l. (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 14,476,866 (of which number 14,407,269 were private or press messages). The minimum rate on ordinary telegrams is 9½f. for 12 words: additional words 1½f. each.

There are eleven radio coast stations in and around New Zealand, which are under the control of the New Zealand Government, namely: Awanui, Auckland, Wellington, Awarua, on the mainland and in addition Chatham Islands, and Kawan Island on the Islands of that name off the coast of New Zealand, Aitutaki, Mangaiia and Rarotonga, in the Cook Group; Apia, in Western Samoa; and Nine Island. Of these, all but Awanui, Awarua and Apia are low power stations; and all but Nine Island which is a radio-telephone station, are radio-telegraph stations. The small stations at Aitutaki, Kawan Island, Mangaiia and Nine Island engage exclusively in point-to-point communication. By means of the Awanui and Apia stations communication is maintained between New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.

In addition there are 22 wireless ship-stations registered in New Zealand.

Tramways have been established in most of the principal towns in New Zealand.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, New Plymouth, Invercargill, Napier and Wanganui have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle, while a system in Gisborne is worked with storage battery cars. In Wellington
and Dunedin there are cable tramways connecting with the higher levels. In Wanganui the higher levels of Campbelltown are reached by means of an elevator. In Christchurch, in addition to electricity, some casual traffic is operated by means of steam tramway locomotives.

The total expenditure by the General Government on the construction of roads and bridges from the inauguration of the Public Works policy in 1870, till the end of March, 1924, amounted to £14,513,771.

The Government has also expended on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels, and in aiding works on mineral lands, etc., £82,975.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations.

All the principal towns in the Dominion have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In many of the towns of New Zealand, both large and small, electric generating stations have been established, operated by steam, water, and internal combustion engines for the supply of electrical energy for street lighting, domestic lighting, heating, cooking, etc., and for power purposes. These installations are generally under the control of the corporations.

The Government has designed and carried out an important scheme for the development of electrical energy from water power at Lake Coleridge in Canterbury. The powerhouse is designed to generate 12,000 K.W., the present plant capacity being 12,000 K.W., and the present maximum load about 11,000 K.W., which is rapidly increasing. Extensions are now in course of construction to increase the plant capacity to 27,000 K.W. The total number of units generated for year ended 31st March, 1924, was 48,777,886. The current is transmitted at a pressure of 66,000 volts over three separate transmission lines to Christchurch, 63 miles distant, where it is utilised to operate the tramways, and for public and private lighting, manufacturing and general industrial and farming purposes throughout an area of some 300 square miles. The cost of generation at Lake Coleridge amounted to 8·20¢ per K.W. year, or 0·426¢ per unit transmitted and sold in bulk in Christchurch, including operating and capital charges. Extension of the system of transmission and distribution to South Canterbury and other districts is under construction. Future developments will probably include the operation of suitable sections of the Government railways and the manufacture of fertilisers. The scheme is under the direct control of the Government, and has been in successful operation since February, 1915. There are many other natural sources of power available in different parts of the Dominion, totalling over 4,000,000 h.p. The development of one of the most promising in the North Island (Mangahao, 26,000 h.p.) is almost completed and a commencement has been made at Arapuni on the Waikato River on a scheme to develop 60,000 h.p. The Lake Coleridge scheme has cost up to year ending 31st March, 1924, £892,801. In the North Island the only plant at present operated by the Government in connection with the national electric supply system is situated at Hora Hora on the Waikato River. The installed capacity is 6,300 K.W., which will shortly be increased to 10,300 K.W. The output for year ending 31st March, 1924, was 45,077,150 units but with the demand for power in the Waikato District the annual output will rapidly increase. The capital cost up to 31st March, 1924, was £474,817. A comprehensive scheme for the development, transmission and distribution of power throughout the North Island has been submitted to Parliament and a similar scheme has been developed for the South Island.

In the meanwhile the following authorizations have been passed by Parliament:

**Aid to Water Power Act, 1910.**

Lake Coleridge and other Works £500,000

Electric Power Works Loan, 1919.

Arapuni Electric Power Works 4,500,000

Mangahao Electric Power Works 1,600,000

Lake Coleridge Extensions 257,500

Horahora Electric Power Works purchase 212,500

Horahora Electric Power Works Extensions 200,000

Waikaremoana Scheme Surveys 30,000

Otago Scheme Surveys 30,000

**Finance Act, 1920.**

Lake Coleridge Extensions 720,000

Kaituna River Electric Power Works 150,000

Waikaremoana Electric Power Works 2,600,000

Other Surveys 30,000

Dunedin is lighted by electricity generated by water power from the Waipori River, under the control of the City Corporation, which also supplies electrical energy from the same sources for industrial and manufacturing purposes. The installed capacity of the plant is 6,000 K.W. The output for year ending 31st March, 1924, was 30,154,599 units.

Other towns with electrical installations for street and private lighting are Auckland, Whangarei, Rotorua, Napier, Hastings, New Plymouth, Stratford, Inglewood, Hawera, Patea, Reefton, Ross, Christchurch, Timaru, Gore, Mataura, Hamilton, Te Aroha, Waitara, Eketahuna, Feilding, Tauranga, Gisborne, Winton, Ashburton, Bluff, Ohakune, Taihape, Mangaweka, Oamaru, Te Kuiti, Bulls, Huntly, Kaponga, Martinborough, Ngarurawhia, Opotiki, Pahiatua, Pukekohe, Raetihi, Thames, Pacors, Devonport, Kaikoura, Fairlie, Motueka, Murdochson, Tamakiwest, Havelock North, Milton, Cambridge, Morrinsville, Te Puke, Richmond, Wakefield, Wairoa, Waiuku, Waverley, Akaroa, Brightwater, Lyttelton, Rangiora, Kaiapoi, Havelock, Invercargill, Hokitika, Pirot, Kaitangata, Roxburgh, Outram, Moegiel, Te Awamutu, and Wanganui.

The total installed power in the Dominion, from all sources amounts to 65,954 kilowatt, and involves a total capital outlay of £7,822,034. The number of units sold in the year ended 31st March, 1924, amounted to 173,895,292.

The coasts of the Dominion are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Thames Gisborne, Wairoa, Napier, Wanganui, Patea, New Plymouth, Opunake, Waitara, Nelson, Westport, Greymouth, Hokitika, Wairau, Lyttelton, Timaru, Oamaru, and Dunedin. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.
Road and railway formation works are carried out under contracts and by the co-operative system, under which the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of labourers and artisans at rates fixed by Government officers on the ground. These rates are calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 16s. to 18s. per day for artisans, and from 13s. to 14s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day. Buildings and large bridges are built by contract, let after inviting tenders through the press.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England and Europe and with Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States and Canada.

Postage Rates.

The postage on letters inland is 1d. for the first ounce or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each additional ounce or fraction thereof, and to such places as accept matter at the reduced rate, 1d. for the first ounce or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each additional ounce or fraction thereof. The reduced rate applies in any case to British possessions, and to a number of foreign countries. The letter postage to other places beyond New Zealand is 2½d. for the first ounce, and 1½d. for each succeeding ounce, or fraction thereof. The inland rate for newspapers is ¼d. each. The minimum rate for newspapers printed and published in New Zealand, for the United Kingdom, is 1d. for each newspaper, irrespective of weight, but subject to certain conditions as to despatch. The ordinary rate for Australia and New Guinea (except Dutch New Guinea) and certain other British possessions is 1½d. for each newspaper. The rate for newspapers for other places, and for newspapers not printed and published in New Zealand addressed to the United Kingdom, is for each newspaper—1½d. for the first 4 ounces, and ¼d. for each additional 2 ounces or fraction thereof. The inland parcel post rates are:—½d. for the first lb. and 2½d. for each additional lb. up to 10 lbs., and 1½d. for each additional lb. up to 28 lbs. The postage rates applicable to an 11 lb. parcel are charged on all parcels (except parcels containing fishing rods, golf clubs or similar articles) that weigh less than 11 lb. if such parcels exceed 4 ft. length and girth combined. A fragile fee is charged on all inland parcels which the senders desire forwarded to destination in hampers, the fee being 9½d. in cases where length and girth combined exceed 4 ft., and when parcels, not exceeding 1 in. in thickness, exceed 4 ft. in length and width combined. In all other cases the fee is 6½d.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Dominion. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Arikiis, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

The Islands became part of the Dominion of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The administration and laws were continued in force subject to the provisions of the Cook Islands Government Act, passed in that year.

In 1915 an Act was passed by the New Zealand Parliament consolidating the laws relating to the Cook Islands and Niue Island, and providing for the appointment of a member of the Executive Council of New Zealand as the Minister for the Cook Islands, who is charged with the administration of the government of the Islands.

The Act also makes provision for the constitution of Island Councils; for the establishment of public schools, Courts of Justice, Native Land Court, etc.

The population of the Cook Islands on 31st March, 1924, was estimated at 9,750.

Minister for the Cook Islands, Hon. Sir Maui Pomare, K.B.E., C.M.G.

Secretary, Cook Islands Department, Wellington, J. D. Gray.

Resident Commissioner at Rarotonga, H. F. Ayson.

Rarotonga.

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 26 square miles; population, 3,503, census, 1921.

Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with remarkably rich and productive soil.

The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner is situated here.

New Zealand postal notes apply in the Cook Islands and a government money-order office is in operation. A wireless station is established at Rarotonga.

The total value of exports from the Cook islands for 1923 was £118,710, and imports amounted to £131,590. The principal items of export were fresh fruit, coconuts, copra and shell.

DEPENDENCIES OF NEW ZEALAND.*

Cook Islands.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

* A full account of these Dependencies will be found in the "New Zealand Official Year Book," 1913, to which the Editors desire to express their acknowledgments.
Revenue and expenditure of the Cook and Northern Islands for the year 1923-24; Revenue, 21,940l.; expenditure, 18,430l.

MANGAIA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 110 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,230.

A government wireless station has been established here.

Physical Features.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga.

Coconuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully.

Resident Agent, J. C. Cameron.

ATIU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 22 square miles; population, 837.

Resident Agent, W. H. Scott.

The Island.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge coconuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumera, one of the most valuable of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The coconut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation.

MAUKE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 151 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 578.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and produce of considerable value and quantity is exported.

Resident Agent, J. Dyer.

MITIARO.

Distant from Rarotonga, 142 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 6 square miles; population, 207.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Resident Agent, Tou Ariki.

TAKUTEA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area, ½ square mile.

This island was presented to the Crown by the Ariki of Atiu to whom it belonged. It is a coral island, moderately fertile.

AITUTAKI.

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 450 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 1,373.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Ara-ura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 450 feet high.

Copra is the chief production, and some of the best oranges and pineapples on the market are grown here.

A wireless station has been erected for the purpose of communicating with the other islands of the group.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious when away from their own homes. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group, and their services are much in demand for working the cargo on vessels at Tahiti. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

Resident Agent, A. A. Luckham.

MANUAE AND TE AU-O-TU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 128 miles; area of Manuae, 2½ square miles.

These two small islands are better known as the Hervey Group. They are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

The islands have been leased to Messrs. Bates and Gruning.

NIUE.

Distant from Auckland, 1,343 miles, and from Rarotonga, 590 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 3,750; census, 1921. Steamer connection from Auckland—about six trips each year are made. In order to establish communication with New Zealand, and also with the remaining islands of the Cook group, a wireless station has been erected.

Niue, or Savage Island, was placed under a separate administration by an Amending Act of 1903. Is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coastline is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the coconut, the banana, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores. Recent experiments in cotton growing have been most successful and the product highly reported upon by the British Cotton Growing Association.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are much averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1923 amounted to 13,277l., and the imports to 18,388l. The revenue for 1923-24 was 5,616l., and the expenditure 4,403l. The principal exports were copra, 10,979l.; hats, 1,181l.; fungus, 92l.; basketware, 162l.

Resident Commissioner, G. N. Morris.

PALMERSTON ATOLL.

Distant from Rarotonga, 277 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 85; census, 1921.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about
half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with coconut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Marsters.

Penrhyn.

Distant 740 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 376.

This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Tongareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling pearlshell diving have been made.

The coconut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce, and large concrete tanks have been built by the Administration in the various villages for storage of rain water.

Resident Agent, W. Wilson.

Suwarrow.

Distant from Rarotonga, 525 miles; area, ½ square mile.

Suwarrow is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell. Part of the anchorage has been gazetted as a naval reserve. The remainder of the Island is leased to Capt. Harries, of Rarotonga.

Manihiki and Rakahanga.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 432; Rakahanga, 310.

Manihiki, or Humphrey, is nearly circular. Béche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought and similar tanks to those at Penrhyn have been erected.

Rakahanga, or Rierson, is also an atoll.

The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by overfishing. The Manihiki lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling diving made as in the case at Penrhyn.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

Pukapuka, or Danger Island.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is 720 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 530 persons.

Nassau.

This small island has an area of about 360 acres, of which 300 acres are under cultivation with coconuts. It lies a few miles distant from Pukapuka. The plantation belongs to the Samoa Shipping and Trading Coy., Ltd., of Sydney. There is no indigenous population. The present residents consist of labourers, introduced by the Company to work the plantation.

Education.

The control of education in the Cook Islands has, by the Cook Islands Act, 1915, been placed under the Minister for the Cook Islands. Four schools have been established in Rarotonga. Schools have also been established at Aitutaki, Mauke, Palmerston, Mangaia, and Atiu. The instruction given is similar to that of the New Zealand State Schools. Technical instruction is being made a special feature.

At Niue Island there are two schools conducted on the same lines.

Trade of Cook Islands.

Oranges, bananas, tomatoes, and copra are the chief exports and trade is developing satisfactorily. Tomatoes are sent to New Zealand in Winter and Spring.

The Wellington-San Francisco mail steamer makes 4 weekly calls (North and South bound) at Rarotonga, and during the fruit season (April to September) regular monthly visits are paid by cargo steamer from Auckland to Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mangala and Mauke.

There is a radio station at Rarotonga and arrangements are being made for the erection of a radio station at Aitutaki.

THE ROSS DEPENDENCY.

The Ross Dependency, the government of which was placed under the Governor-General of New Zealand by Imperial Order-in-Council of 30th July, 1923, is defined as "all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of east longitude and the 150th degree of west longitude, which are situated south of the 60th degree of south latitude. The dependency includes Edward VII Land, and portion of South Victoria Land. There are no permanent inhabitants of the territory, but whaling is carried on by a Norwegian firm under licence.

Captain G. S. Hooper is the New Zealand Government representative and administrative officer.

WESTERN SAMOA.

The Territory of Western Samoa, formerly in the possession of Germany, was seized and occupied by New Zealand Troops on behalf of the Imperial Government on the 29th August, 1914. It remained in military occupation during the war, and was surrendered by Germany under the Treaty of Peace to the Allied and Associated Powers, by whom the mandate to govern the ex-German territory was assigned to the Dominion of New Zealand. The mandate was issued by the Council of the League of Nations in December, 1920.

On the 1st May, 1920, by Orders passed by the Governor-General of New Zealand in Council, provision was made for the Civil Administration of the Territory; and by the Samoa Act, 1921, of New Zealand, the constitution and legal system of the territory were settled.

Western Samoa is administered by an Administrator appointed by the Governor-General of New Zealand and responsible to the Minister of External Affairs (a member of the N.Z. Executive Council who is charged with the Government of the territory). There is a Legislative Council consisting of not less than four official members appointed by the Governor-General and of three elected members, chosen by the votes of European population. The Administrator, acting with the advice and consent of this Council, is empowered to make Ordinances for the peace, order and good government of the Territory, subject to disallowance by the Governor-General. A High Court is established, and the Supreme Court of New Zealand is given jurisdiction over Western Samoa.

The Samoan natives are to a large extent granted domestic self-government.

The Faipule (Native Parliament, leading chiefs representing every district) who are appointed by the Administrator, meet twice yearly and draft native orders for submission to the Government.

Minister for External Affairs at Wellington, Hon. Sir Francis Bell, G.C.M.G., K.C.

Secretary for External Affairs at Wellington, J. D. Gray.

Administrator of Samoa, Major-General G. S. Richardson, C.B., C.M.C., C.B.E.

Secretary Samoan Administration, Colonel J. W. Hutchen, C.M.G.

The Territory consists of the Islands of Upolu, Savaii, Apolima and Manono, together with several small islets lying between the 13th and 15th degree S. Lat., and 171st and 173rd degrees West Long., situated some 130 miles North of Tonga and 450 miles N.E. of Fiji. The sailing distance from Auckland (N.Z.) is 1,560 miles, from Sydney 2,570 miles, and from San Francisco 4,400 miles.

The total area of Western Samoa is 725,000 acres, 138,500 acres are alienated, of which (apart from native cultivation) 18,400 acres are under cultivation. The main products for 1923 were copra, 13,484 tons (of which three quarters was produced by the Natives), and cocoa, 221 tons, all European produced.

There is a four-weekly steamer between Auckland and Apia, which connects en route with the Sydney service at Suva (Fiji), and also a four-weekly connection at Pago Pago (American Samoa), with the San Francisco-Sydney mail steamer.

A radio station situated at Apia works directly with New Zealand and Honolulu, and is also the transmitting station for the stations at Fiji, Tonga, Rarotonga, Tahiti and Pago Pago.

Postal and Banking.—New Zealand postage rates apply in the Territory. A Government Money Order and Savings Bank Office and a Branch of the Bank of New Zealand are in operation at Apia. British currency is in circulation.

Medical Services.—A Government Hospital is maintained at Apia, with a staff of European doctors and nurses; district hospitals have been established at Tusivi (Savaii) and Aleipota (Upolu). Dangerous fevers and reptiles are unknown.

Roads and Locomotion.—Roads radiate from Apia chiefly following the coast line. Motor traffic is rapidly developing both on land and on water. The coral lagoons form natural highways around many parts of the Islands.

Climate.—The climate is tropical and very equable. The wet season extends from December to March, the remainder of the year being pleasant with trade winds blowing.
