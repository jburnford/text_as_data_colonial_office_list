THE KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," until recently known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the coast line from Umba River to the Juba River, and vast territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. It includes the Witu Protectorate, a small tract of country at the mouth of the Tana. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew on July 31st, 1893. Witu is now regarded for administrative purposes as part of Tanaland.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini, the island of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the fort of Kismayu, these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of £7,000. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and henceforward the Sultan's dominions are styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 248,800 square miles.

A new scheme of administration providing for the separate control of the native and the settled areas, was brought into operation on the 1st of January, 1921.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into the following areas:

1. The Nyanza Province, comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Nandi, Kericho.
2. The Kerio Province, comprising the districts of Ravine, Baringo, Elgeyo, Marakwet, West Suk.
3. The Kikuyu Province, comprising the districts of Kiambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, Embu, Meru.
4. The Ukamba Province, comprising the districts of Machakos, Kitui, Teita.
5. The Coast Province, comprising the districts of Digo, Malindi, Tana River, Lamu.
6. The Jubaland Province, comprising the districts of Kismayu, Gosha, Afmadiu, Serenli.
7. The Masai Province.
8. The Northern Frontier Province.

The Military authorities are administering the Turkana tribes on the north-western confines of the Colony.

The Northern Frontier District is also under Military Control, and is administered by the O.C. 5th King's African Rifles, with headquarters at Meru.

The capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the colony. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Europeans | Asiatics | Natives |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1923 | 3,071     | 8,358    | 12,666  |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 39,000, of whom about 814 are Europeans. It is situated on the eastern side of an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, on the south-western side of the island. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the Port. Kilindini is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply and a scheme for improved harbour facilities is being carried out.

The two principal rivers in the North are the Tana and Juba, which flow into the Indian Ocean. They are both navigable for about 400 miles by shallow draught steamers.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 2,619,661, including 23,470 Asiatics and 10,295 Europeans. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Masai, the Somalis and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Muhammadanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Following the annexation of part of the East Africa Protectorate in 1920, under the Royal Instructions dated the 11th September of that year, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner and Principal Medical Officer (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of
expressed in terms of two rupees; the sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The silver currency in most districts and graphite are found in Ukai.
ringo, Elgeyo, Marakwet, West members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of
the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, ten ex officio members, not more than seven nominated official members, eleven European elected members, and four Indian elected members; the ex officio members to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Uganda Railway, Land Officer, Director of Agriculture, Director of Public Works, and Chief of Customs; the nominated official members to be such persons holding office in the Colony or Protectorate of Kenya as the Governor may appoint; the European elected members to be such fit persons as may be elected under the Electoral Ordinance of 1919 or any subsequent law; the Indian elected members to be such fit persons as may be elected under any law enacted for the purpose. If one of the nominated official members is not specially appointed to represent the interests of the Arab community, there shall be a nominated unofficial member to represent such interests, who shall be such Arab or other person representing such interests and not holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Naivasha, Kisumu and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the East Africa Protectorate.

In 1921 provision was made for the substitution, as a temporary measure, of four Indian nominated members for the two Indian elected members. The constitution was further revised in 1923 by the increase of the nominated official members to a maximum of ten, the substitution of five Indian elected members for the four Indian nominated members, and the addition of one Arab elected member and a nominated unofficial member (chosen from among the Christian Missionaries in Kenya) to represent the interests of the African community.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate form one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

Climate.

The Lowlands, or districts near the coast, are fairly healthy for the tropics. The hot season is from January to April. The Highlands, or central plateaux, have a temperate climate, the mean average temperature at noon is 78° F. July, August and September are usually cold months.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at 1s. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent. piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921, from circulation. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents, of a rupee) remain in circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (cents, of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26 Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of British East Africa, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The National Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office:—Pretoria) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi and Eldoret.

Land and Products.

The agricultural products of the lowlands are coconuts, cotton, maize, sisal, sugar cane and the miscellaneous native grains, and oil seed.

Effort towards a large extension of the area under cotton is now being made. In the highlands, coffee, maize, sisal are the premier crops and an increasing export trade in these products is noteworthy. Cereals (wheat and barley) are successfully grown, while sugar cane, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and a large variety of miscellaneous crops are cultivated on an increasing scale.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands, and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock.

Sheep thrive in restricted areas, and the export of wool is steadily increasing.

The forest products of the coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber and gum-copal. The scrub forests further inland contain ebony and scrub mahogany. The highland forests contain crotton, pencil cedar in large quantities and several good timbers. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kibwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous. Sisal and rubber are being extensively planted.

The mineral resources of the Protectorate are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica diatomite and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is
worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold prospecting activities exist south of Kisii. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

By the 31st December, 1923, 7,589,760 acres had been set aside for agricultural, stock-raising and similar industries, inclusive of 1,100,000 allotted in 1919 and 1920 for ex-soldier settlement and 11,148 in the hands of non-Europeans other than Arabs and Natives. The following table shows the total area actually alienated and occupied on 31st December, 1921, 1922 and 1923; the area under cultivation, the principal crops, and the area under each:

Trade and Customs.

Since the 1st April, 1917, Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

The Customs Tariff has been subjected to considerable revision in recent years. Up to 1921 an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. was in force for practically all imports other than spirits, and certain articles for industrial, agricultural, stock breeding, railway and other services, were admitted free of duty.

The principal export duties were derived from:

(a) a specific tax ranging between 2 and 2½ shillings on birds and animals.
(b) an ad valorem tax ranging between 4 per cent. and 30 per cent. on borites (rafters), chilelis, ebony, gum copal, hides, horns, ivory, rubber, sea shells and hippopotamus teeth.

Legislation enacted in 1921-3, terminating with the Kenya Customs Tariff Ordinance of the 31st December, 1923, has introduced many important changes, the most notable being:

(a) a uniform Tariff for Kenya and Uganda which operates also in Tanganyika Territory.
(b) free trade between Kenya and Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory, in goods the growth, produce or manufacture of each of the Territories.
(c) specific duties on certain classes of imports generally ranging between 10 per cent. and 50 per cent. of their value.
(d) ad valorem duties ranging between 10 per cent. and 30 per cent. on imports not included in the specific list or otherwise provided for. These duties are assessed on the basis of the value of the goods at the port of shipment, plus the cost of packing, loading, freight, insurance, landing and all other charges up to the time of deposit in the Customs premises at the port of importation.
(e) thorough revision of the free list which, while generally maintaining existing exemptions, has added passengers' personal and used household effects, disinfectants, surgical instruments, mining materials, and school stationery and similar requisites, etc.
(f) entire abolition of export duties.

The import tariff as it now stands has been designed, as far as possible, to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country at the expense of those of less utility; and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya and Uganda are, or can be made, self-supporting.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value, in £ sterling, of trade imports (excluding imports on Government account, railway material, and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign), and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources (rupee 16d. till 1921) and the tonnage entered at Kenya ports were as follows:

| Years | Imports | Total Customs Tonnage |
|-------|---------|------------------------|
| 1913-14 | 2,147,937 | 1,680,189 |
| 1918-19 | 3,397,810 | 3,224,854 |
| 1919-20 | 3,119,536 | 4,321,454 |

| (9 months) | 2,871,240 | 5,504,579 |
| 1922 | 4,257,843 | 5,377,122 |
| 1923 | 779,731 | 1,153,826 |

Up to 31st March, 1921, the fiscal year was from 1st April to 31st March. The nine months in 1921 as from 1st April to 31st December. From then onwards the year is:—1st January to 31st December.

Communications.

The Union Castle Line and the British India Steam Navigation Co. maintain a monthly service of passenger steamers from Marseilles to Madagascar fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The Messageries Maritime from Marseilles to Madagascar call fortnightly at Mombasa, homewards and outwards.

The "Italina" Navigation Company have two lines calling monthly; one steamer running as far as Zanzibar, and back to Genoa, and the other as far as Durban, and also back to Genoa, calling at the principal ports en route, including those of Italian Somaliland.

The Clan Ellerman Harrison Line maintains a three-weekly service of fast cargo steamers from Liverpool as far as Beira.

The Holland Africa Line maintains a fortnightly service from London and continental ports to South and East Africa calling at this Port.

The Deutsche Ost Afrika line maintains a six-weekly passenger and cargo service between Mombasa, Continental ports and Southampton.

The fortnightly Mail Service to Bombay and Durban is maintained by the British India Steam Navigation Company passenger and cargo steamers.

Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co. and Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw Bros.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway was worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by a Central Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Colony (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes. The length of the line including branches, in Kenya Colony is 651 miles, with a gauge of one metre. Ten steamers on Lake Victoria are also worked in connection with the railway. The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda. The construction cost, including steamers, etc., to December 31st, 1923, was £8,166,562. During the year ending 31st December, 1923, 369,062 tons of goods (exclusive of railway material) and 646,314 passengers were carried.

Year ending 31/12/23.

Revenue .................................................................. £1,237,736
Expenditure .......................................................... £822,385

A branch railway is being constructed, under agreement with Griffiths & Co., Ltd., from Nakuru (at mile 448 on the Uganda Railway) to Turbo (145 miles) on the Uasin Gishu plateau, and on 31/12/23, 33 miles were open for traffic.

Pauling & Co., Ltd., are now constructing a deep-water wharf wall at Ras Killindini, with sheds.

The Post Office of the Colony (inclusive of the Uganda Post Office, which is worked by the Kenya Post Office) received and despatched during 1923 7,808,600 letters, packets, etc., and 309,971 telegrams.

The telegraph system has 4,114 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda). The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu (200 miles), Mombasa with Gazi (31 miles), Mombasa with Kisumu (587 miles), Kisumu with Entebbe (281 miles) (75 miles double line in Kenya, rest in Uganda), Londiani with Eldama Ravine (22 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho (174 miles), Nairobi with Nyeri, West Kenya, Meru and Archers Post (204 miles), Kibigori with Nandi, Eldoret, Sergott, Hoey's Bridge and Kitale (107 miles), Magadi Junction with Machakos (16½ miles), Magadi Railway (91 miles), Kismayu with Gobwen, (10 miles), Elmenteita with Narok (58 miles), Nakuru with Rumuruti (59 miles), Muhoroni with Songhor (10 miles), Nairobi with Kyambu (10 miles), Voi to Tanganyika Border (81 miles).
