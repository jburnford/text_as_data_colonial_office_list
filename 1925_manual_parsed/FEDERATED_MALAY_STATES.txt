MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

Johore had entered into a Treaty with Great Britain as early as 1865, and in 1885, the Sultan, by an agreement dated the 11th of December, placed his foreign relations under the control of the British Government. He also undertook to receive a British Agent at his Court when required to do so, but no such appointment was made until January, 1910, when, in consequence of a request received from the Sultan, Mr. D. G. Campbell, Resident of Negri Sembilan, was transferred to Johore to act as His Highness's Adviser.

In May, 1914, the Sultan suggested that, with a view to the development of the State, the Agreement of 1885 should be revised to permit the appointment of a General Adviser with powers similar to those exercised by British Residents in the Federated Malay States. His Majesty's Government accepted the proposal and a subsidiary agreement was accordingly signed by His Highness and the Governor of the Straits Settlements on the 12th of May.

The other States came under British protection in 1909 as a consequence of a Treaty, signed at Bangkok on March 10th of that year, by which Siam transferred to Great Britain all her rights over them. The transfer was formally effected in July, 1909, and British officers were then appointed to reside at the Courts of the native rulers, and to assist them in the administration of their territories.

The officer administering the Government of the Straits Settlements is His Majesty's High Commissioner for all Protected States in the Peninsula.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,500 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The area alienated for cultivation extends to some 820,000 acres of which upwards of 441,000 acres are under rubber, and a further 134,000 acres are under coconuts. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and the Johore, which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bahru, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Penggaram in Batu Pahat. The
population of Johore Bahru is 15,312. The population of the whole State as determined at the census of 1921 is 282,234, about 56 per cent. of whom are Malays.

The principal exports from Johore were (in 1923) rubber (35,966 tons), gambier (1,991 tons), copra (27,123 tons), tapioca (6,942 tons) and areca nuts (14,657 tons).

The mineral resources of the States were formerly much neglected, but the discovery of a rich tin field in the East Coast resulted in considerable activity. During 1923, the export of tin ore amounted to 1,329 tons valued at $1,838,451. Iron ore is found in abundance, 154,000 tons were exported. China clay deposits occur over a large area and are worked on a small scale.

The public revenue in 1923 was $11,094,955 while the expenditure amounted to $7,064,166. The public debt of the State on the 31st December, 1923, was $800,000.

Returns show the value of imports to be $27,859,594 (3,251,452L.), and of exports to be $56,779,727 (6,624,301L.).

The Johore State Railway, to which reference has been made above (see Federated Malay States), runs from Kuala Gemas on the Negri Sembilan border to Johore Bahru, a distance of 129 miles. The line, which was opened for traffic in July, 1909, was constructed by the Railway Department of the Federated Malay States, the necessary funds being lent by the Federation. It is now leased to the Federated Malay States for a period of years at an annual rental.

KEDAH.

H.H. Abdul Hamid Halimshah ilmi Ahmad Tajudin, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Kedah is a State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula situated between the parallels of 5° 5' and 6° 35' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 35' and 101° 10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (north and east) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1890, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the south. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the north of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern watershed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 105 miles length and about 65 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi group, about 3,800 square miles. The four highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Bintang (6,103 feet), Gunong Kangar (4,760 feet), Gunong Jerai (3,91 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,823 feet). Gunung Raja, on Langkawi Island, is 2,950 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammedanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like other States in the Peninsula, it was, at various times, under the domination of Burmah, Aceh, Malacca and Siam. Like the other States, too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul Perlis, and part of Singgora on the north, and Krian on the south, and under a weak man, or upon the rising of a stronger power beyond the borders, its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1611), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Oppenhoefda (Commandants) in Kedah from 1654 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese, and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammad Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1841 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammedans. Only a few families of the aborigines (Sakais) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River. They numbered 105 all told at the 1911 census.
South Kedah, the area lying south of the mountain known as Kedah Peak (Gunong Jerai), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils, planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying lands along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang and to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 245,986 at the 1911 census. At the 1921 census the population was 338,546, of whom 300 were Europeans, 75 Eurasians, 237,043 Malays, 59,403 Chinese, 33,019 Indians and 8,704 "other races."

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered, with the exception of a deposit of marble which may prove to be of value.

Climate.

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the daytime rising to over 90 deg. F. and falling to nearly 70 deg. F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply, which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

Communications.

Steamers ply between Penang and Semiling, and Yen (in South Kedah), and Sala, and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 48 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road is being pushed forward towards the Patani frontier, through Langgar. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak, and other metalled roads have been completed or are under construction. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns; 183 miles of canals are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Mertajam, in Province Wellesley and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier. Trains have been running regularly since October, 1915. A connection through Perlis, with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There is an English school and a Malay girls' school in Alor Star. There are 61 Malay schools.

Constitution.

Until the beginning of this century the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

On the 23rd July, 1905, the Sultan, by an edict, appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country.

The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud. The Adviser and the Chief Judge are ex-officio members, and two members may be nominated.

In 1913, the Sultan's health became such that it was necessary to appoint his eldest son, Tunku Ibrahim, as Regent, pending the restoration of the Sultan's health.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,600,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent. The Federated Malay States Government paid the interest, $120,953, due at the time of the transfer, and added it on to the capital, thus making the loan amount to $2,720,953.

The public revenue and expenditure during the last five years were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1338 (A.D. 1920) | $6,650,319 | $4,306,681 |
| A.H. 1339 (A.D. 1921) | $5,235,450 | $5,348,756 |
| A.H. 1340 (A.D. 1922) | $5,373,870 | $6,290,063 |
| A.H. 1341 (A.D. 1923) | $5,081,138 | $5,311,742 |
| A.H. 1342 (A.D. 1924) | $5,284,554 | $5,667,979 |

The Public Debt on the 31st of December, 1923, was $1,500,000.

Trade.

The following were the principal exports from Kedah during the year 1341 (1923):—Padi and rice, rubber, tapioca and sago, forest produce, tin ore, fish, bricks, cattle, hides and horns, pigs and poultry.

The value of the Kedah and Perlis trade with Penang during 1341 (1923) was as follows:—Exports, $21,005,690; imports, $6,293,534. The figures for 1920 A.D. were: exports, $6,848,092; imports, $6,024,474.

The value of Kedah and Perlis trade with the F.M.S. during 1341, was: Exports, $920,243; imports, $64,350. The figures for 1920 A.D. were: exports, $733,891; imports, $122,380.

Perlis.

H.H. Syed Atwi, C.B.E., Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula North of Kedah. Its area is 316 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano. Perlis has a bi-weekly steamer communication with Penang, and has a good system of telegraphs and telephones. There are fifteen miles of metalled roads, and thirty miles of earth roads.

The population is about 41,000. The public revenue and expenditure for the last five years were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1338 A.D. 1920 | $443,443 | $277,994 |
| A.H. 1339 A.D. 1921 | $341,420 | $337,331 |
| A.H. 1340 A.D. 1922 | $284,730 | $304,251 |
| A.H. 1341 A.D. 1923 | $397,187 | $342,698 |
| A.H. 1342 A.D. 1924 | $453,452 | $341,155 |

The State, by loans made in 1906 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. The total debt of the State is now $300,000. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

KELANTAN.

H.H. the Sultan Ismail bin Almerhum,
Sultan Mohamed IV., K.C.M.G.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 5° 46' and 6° 15' north, and between longitudes 101° 23' and 102° 40' east. It is bounded on the north by the China Sea; on the east by Trengganu; on the south by Pahang; and on the west by Perak and the Siamese Monthon of Petani. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,870 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the state according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in July, 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the south. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabel, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1921 Census was 309,293, including 127 Europeans, 286,334 Malays, 12,779 Chinese, 3,623 Indians, and 6,396 others.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 10,800 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has three schools attended by some 543 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Kuala Krai has been completed. It is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Puteh, Kuala Krai, Chehil and Bangnara. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 2,406), Besok (population 766), on the coast, Pasir Puteh (population 858), and Kuala Krai, the head quarters of the southern district of the State. The trunk road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai is open for traffic.

Pasir Puteh is connected with Kota Bharu by a road which is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, which will eventually connect Kelantan with Singapore, has been completed as regards the section between Tumpat and K. Krai, while communication with Penang is now established with a daily train service each way, Sundays excepted.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the annual harvest of which amounts to 70,000 tons. Kelantan is one of the few Malay States which export padi and rice. Coconuts and betel nuts are also extensively grown. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years. In addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. Most of the estates have reached the tapping stage. There is now a steady output of rubber, the quality of which is of a high standard. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, though it has been necessary temporarily to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of silk sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Since the extension of British protection to Kelantan, there have been several applications for land for tin mining.

The tin mining industry is likely to increase when the railway is able to carry supplies to the back country. Recent prospecting points to a possibility of gold being found in payable quantities.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, cattle, padi and rice, betel nuts, fish, and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot, and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land
breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 103 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, but a coin made from an alloy of tin and lead and called pittis is also current in the bazaar; 480 pittis equal one dollar.

Regular steam communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

TRENGGANU.

H. H. Sleman bin Almerhum Zenalabidin, K.C.M.G., Sultan.
British Adviser, J. L. Humphreys, 1,680/.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 30' and 5° 45' North, and longitude 102° 15' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 5,000 square miles.

The total population of the State, as recorded by the census taken in April, 1921, is 153,092. This total is made up as follows:

- European and kindred races ... 34
- Malay races ... ... ... 144,859
- Chinese ... ... ... 7,240
- Indians ... ... ... 215
- Other nationalities ... ... ... 744

There are some 20 miles of completed road at Kuala Trengganu and 20 miles more under construction. There are no railways. Communication with the interior is entirely by means of the rivers and good native paths. Telegraphic communication was established between the State, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements in March, 1922. There is a telephone exchange at Kuala Trengganu.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 12,453.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretai, Dungun, Paka, Marang, Ibar, Stiu, and Besut.

The public revenue and expenditure in 1923 were $642,679 and $788,902 respectively.

Total value of exports from Trengganu in 1923, was $2,747,605, and of imports $2,058,589. The principal imports were:

- Rice ... ... ... ... $846,134
- Sugar ... ... ... ... 87,119
- Condensed Milk ... ... ... 20,862
- Tobacco, cigars and cigarettes ... ... 192,869
- Cotton stuffs ... ... ... 297,617
- Petroleum ... ... ... 117,957
- Food stuffs ... ... ... 449,959
- Intoxicating liquors ... ... ... 20,684
- Building materials ... ... ... 43,136

Exports.

- Copra ... ... ... ... $273,641
- Dried fish and balchan ... ... ... 996,717
- Tin ore ... ... ... ... 482,172
- Wolfram ore ... ... ... ... 86,110
- Para rubber ... ... ... ... 625,690
- Mattings (including mats) ... ... ... 20,778
- Areca-nuts ... ... ... ... 35,147
- Gambier cube ... ... ... ... 86,143

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the north-east monsoon, from November to February. The rainfall recorded at Kretai was: in 1920, 91°50'; in 1921, 152°29'; in 1922, 145°37' inches. In 1923 the rainfall recorded at Kuala Kretai was 115°29' inches, and at Kuala Trengganu 80°72 inches. The temperature ranges between 63° and 92° F., the greatest range in 24 hours being 25°.

Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper.

During part of the north-east monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable. British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909. The suzerainty of Siam, transferred on that date to Great Britain, was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the Bunga Mas to Bangkok. This tribute will not be rendered in future either to Siam or to Great Britain.

An Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainal Abidin was signed in Singapore on the 22nd April, 1910.

This agreement of four articles provides that mutual help shall be rendered by the two Governments, and for the rendition of fugitive
criminals. It also provides for the appointment of a British Officer to reside in Trengganu to be an Agent with functions similar to those of a Consular Officer. His Majesty's Government undertake to protect the Government and the State of Trengganu and all its Dependencies from attack by foreign enemies, and the Trengganu Government surrenders the management of all political matters with Foreign Governments to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The limitation of mining and agricultural concessions to any person other than natives and subjects of Trengganu is also provided for.

This agreement was amended on May 24th, 1919. Under the amended agreement the Sultan agrees to accept a British Officer, called the British Adviser, whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues. Mr. J. L. Humphreys, who had held the post of British Agent for three years, was appointed the first British Adviser.

The ruling line of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainal Abidin, through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The State is included within the Postal Union, under the regulations approved by the Convention of Rome, on the 26th May, 1906.

A loan of $1,000,000 granted by the S.S. Government in 1923 has enabled Trengganu to resume large Ruling House Land Concessions and to commence a programme of surveys, road construction, and other development works.

The mining and agricultural resources of the State are at present practically untouched.
