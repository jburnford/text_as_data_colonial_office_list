*JAMAICA.*

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 42' 20" and 18° 32' 30", and W. long. 76° 11' 55" and 78° 23' 35". It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,450 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,388 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the south-west, and the Rio Grande in the north-east. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 62,707 in 1921, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 75° 38' and 81° 30' W. long, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, are dependencies of Jamaica,† as are also Pedro and Morant Cays (two guano islands in 17° N. lat.).

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,848,160 acres, from which may be deducted 80,000 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,768,160 acres available for cultivation. Of this 1,090,117 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1923-24.

**History.**

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, the Governor of Hispaniola. It was raided by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596-7, and by Colonel Jackson in 1643, but it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force, sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trilling resistance, on the 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II., who appointed General Edward Doyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. Part of this town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston which then consisted of a few sheds, soon rose into a place of importance. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves. These consisted primarily of the slaves the Spaniards left, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains, but before long runaway slaves from English masters took refuge in the mountains of the centre of the island and were only subjugated in 1738, when both classes of maroons were settled in five reserves under their own leaders, and henceforth gave little trouble except for a partial rising in 1795, which was soon suppressed, the prisoners taken being sent to Sierra Leone. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,521 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A rebellion among the coloured population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1907, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of 150,000l. was voted by Parliament, and a loan of 800,000l., chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer.

**Climate and Inhabitants.**

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78° F., rising to 87° F. in the daytime, and falling to 71° F. at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons occur generally over the whole island in May and June and again in September, October and November; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers; and in the N.E. portion of the island there is usually a rainy season at the end of the year, and light rains generally during the month of August. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches to as much as 187 inches at Fellowship and 222 inches at Moore Town, both on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain Range.

Under two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, somewhat over three-fourths being pure negroes. There are about 18,000 coolies, and about 3,700 Chinese (in 1921). English is universally spoken.

**Constitution.**

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a nominated Council, and an elected Assembly which on its first meeting in 1664, consisted of 30 members but which fluctuated in numbers from time to time. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored. A separate Privy Council was set up and an Executive Committee was established. The latter was to act as a sort of Cabinet, especially as regards financial matters.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature responded by abrogating all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

Accordingly a Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex-officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial
Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons as may be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty, but the number of members is not to exceed eight. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

A special feature of this constitution is that nine elected members can carry any financial measure, while the unanimous vote of the whole fourteen elected members on other matters cannot be overridden by the other votes unless the governor declares that such a decision is of paramount importance in the public interest.

Administration.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty, the excise on rum and stamps and licences. A tax of £1 (in Kingston &c.) on every £10 of the gross value of property is levied.

There is a Supreme Court of Judicature together with Resident Magistrate Courts and Petty Sessions of Justices of the Peace throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of Petty Sessions.

An "Island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the Parochial Boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 14 other parishes, under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, waterworks, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population, in 1921, 62,707), Port Royal (population 1,004), Spanish Town (population 8,694), Port Antonio (population 6,272), Montego Bay (population 6,580), Falmouth (population 2,136), Port Maria (population 2,481), and Savanna la Mar (population 3,442).

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1923-24 was 241,084l.; their expenditure 207,123l. Their debt at the end of the year was 58,596l.

Currency and Banking.

British currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000l. The Colonial Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada and the Canadian Bank of Commerce are the only private banking establishments in the Colony. The Colonial Bank has one branch and 10 sub-branches; it had an average weekly note circulation in 1923 of 72,530l. The Bank of Nova Scotia has 1 branch and 11 sub-branches, and had an average note circulation in 1923 of 39,801l. The Royal Bank of Canada has one branch and 3 sub-branches had an average note circulation in 1923 of 35,443l. The Canadian Bank of Commerce has a branch in Kingston, and an average note circulation in 1923 of 5,372l. There are also 20,000l. of British currency notes in circulation. British silver coins above 6d. are legal tender to any extent; coins of 6d. and less amount to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Under Law 27 of 1904, local Currency Notes, which are made legal tender under section 5, have been issued to the extent of 212,500l. in denominations of 2s. 6d., 5s. and 10s.; 2s. 6d. notes, 31,250l.; 5s. notes, 106,250l.; 10s. notes, 75,000l. Estimated amount of local currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1924, was 85,644l. 2s. 6d.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent., and in 1897 to 2½ per cent. In 1917 the rate of interest was again increased to 3 per cent. There are 15 branches and 52 postal agencies. Savings Certificates: The balance at credit under this head to 31st December, 1923, is 1,365l. The total deposits on 31st December, 1923, was 559,887l.

Co-Operative Loan Banks.

There are 63 Loan Banks on the Register of Industrial and Provident Societies. Of these, 37 have obtained loans from the Agricultural Loan Societies Board appointed under Law 6 of 1912, "A Law for the encouragement of Agricultural Loan Societies."

The following is a summary of these transactions to 30th September, 1923:

| Loans made under Law 6 of 1912 | 34,016l. 9s. 0d. |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| Hurricane or Special Loan Laws | 80,489l. 12s. 4d. |

Total 114,506l. 1s. 4d.

Of this amount, 93,828l. 14s. 4d. has been repaid, leaving 20,677l. 7s. 0d. outstanding.

The Co-operative Banks also collected to 31st October, 1923, the sum of over 35,529l. share capital, and have accumulated Reserves amounting to 17,543l. These figures may be taken as an indication that the work of the Loan Banks has been successfully carried on during the year, and that they are likely to prove a permanent benefit to Small Holders and Peasant Proprietors. Some of these Bunks have extended their sphere of usefulness by taking advantage of the Land Settlement Scheme, whereby Government moneys are lent for the purchase of properties for the purpose of re-sale in lots to small settlers. 55,951l. 8s. 1d. has been loaned to nine Banks, under this head, and 17,657l. 5s. repaid. The scheme has been well received, and its extension in the future seems certain.
Education.

Elementary education is provided for from public funds and, during recent years, 115 Government (undenominational) elementary schools have been established. The number of schools is 683, with 69,368 scholars in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1923 was 109,854£; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges for women teachers. By a law passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. Parish and District School Boards have taken up duties delegated to them; the District School Boards manage the Government schools, some of which are held in Government buildings, others in rented buildings.

Provision was made in 1892 for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are sixteen secondary schools receiving aid from public funds under regulations for grants in aid. Secondary education is provided for in general by endowed schools, under local governing bodies controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. A beginning has been made in providing from public funds for technical education. There are three scholarships (one for girls) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica. The following examinations are held:—London University, Cambridge Locals, Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society.

In the Institute of Jamaica (in Kingston) is a Public Library with 22,000 books, of which 6,000 form a West India Reference Library; a Natural History Museum, with a small collection of live animals; and a Jamaica History Gallery.

Industry.

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1923 being 100,770 boxes, with a value of 41,702£, and that of bananas being 12,454,216 stems, with a value of 2,263,116£.

The area under sugar cane in 1923-24 was 48,184 acres, and under coffee 18,849. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations. Area under banana cultivation, 74,548 acres.

The large coffee plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain Range. Comparatively few of the large plantations remain however, and the great bulk of the coffee exported is grown by small landowners on the limestone formation, which is the principal geological area. The great fruit growing districts are in St. Mary, with Port Maria, Annotto Bay, and St. Catherine, with Kingston for its outlet. Sugar is largely grown in Westmoreland and in the district of Vere Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawney, where the best rum in the world is produced. The cattle-raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses and cattle.

The cultivation of cotton has recently been undertaken. There are 198 acres now under cultivation.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, potable spirits and beer, building materials, oils, motor vehicles, cotton piece goods and cigarettes. Of the total trade of the island by far the greater portion is with the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada being next in importance.

The following are the figures for 1923:

10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. The two cables from Cuba touch at Jamaica, from which they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

Telegraph lines connect all the principal towns, and there are 134 telegraph and telephone stations. The total mileage open is 1,348—978 miles along roads, 173 miles P.O. lines on railway, and 197 along railway lines. The receipts in 1923 were £17,115l.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of Saint James, a distance of 112½ miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17½ miles; and to Port Antonio by a branch line from Bogwalk, on the Ewarton branch, of 64½ miles, and by a branch line from May Pen to Chapelton, 13½ miles; also from Linstead to New Works, 2½ miles. The total length of line open is 200 miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge for 1923-24, providing for interest and repayment, is £169,017l. The receipts in 1923-24 were more than the expenditure by £30,763l., leaving a deficiency of £138,354l. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 112½ miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17½ miles; from Bogwalk to Port Antonio, 54½ miles; from May Pen to Chapelton, 13 miles; and from Linstead to New Works 2½ miles.

The island is intersected by an extensive system of metalled and gravelled roads, suitable for motoring, the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum grades are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,239 miles of main roads, and about 4,366 miles of parochial roads.

The United Fruit Co. at present run a fortnightly coasting service by steamship, calling at the principal out-ports.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1923, no ships were built.

CAYMAN ISLANDS.

The Cayman Islands (a dependency of Jamaica) with an area of 104 square miles and a population (in 1921) of 5,253, consist of three islands, Grand Cayman (85 square miles), Little Cayman (9 square miles), and Cayman Brac (10 square miles), lying between 79° 33' and 81° 30' W. longitude, and 19° 16', and 19° 45' N. latitude. They were discovered by Columbus, on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession of them soon after the conquest of Jamaica, and they were mainly colonised from that island.

Grand Cayman is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, and varies from 4 to 7 miles in breadth. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized harbours. One on the north side of the island, called the Great Sound, measures over six miles across.

The principal industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle. These turtle are brought to the island and placed in "kraals," to recover and fatten before being sent to their next stage, Key West, United States. Over 2,000 turtles a year are thus disposed of at an average price of £2 each.

The Island of Grand Cayman is in some parts fruitful, and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honey-combed limestone, and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found in quantities. Phosphate deposits of some value exist, and were worked, but have lately been neglected.

There are two towns, Georgetown and Bodden-town, and several villages. The population of Grand Cayman numbered 3,945 at the census of 1921.

The smaller Cayman Islands, viz., Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are about 70 miles distant from Grand Cayman; they are almost entirely given up to the growth of cocoanuts. Their inhabitants numbered at the last reckoning 95 and 1,213 persons respectively.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is much larger than in most parts of the West Indies.

Fine schooners of native woods are constructed at these islands for sale and for local use, the people being first-rate shipwrights.

The Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands consists of the Justices of the Peace and elected Vestrymen, and the laws passed by this body are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming operative.

The government of the Dependency is administered by a Commissioner.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is about 166 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 64 miles long and 13 miles broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,568 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

Grand Turk claims to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons. 1,626,674 bushels were exported in 1923 valued at 30,271l. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1923 was valued at 1,436l. 1,672,775 dried concha (shell fish) value 1,663l., were shipped to Haiti in 1923. The cultivation of cotton has been introduced, and is making satisfactory progress.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English.

Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1923, 59 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,124 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall during 1923 amounted to 26-98 inches, the rainy season being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups. There was a severe hurricane in 1908, causing great destruction of property.

Means of Communication.

The Bull Line from New York make occasional calls at Cockburn Harbour in the Caicos Group on their sailings to and from St. Domingo.

The Clyde Line from New York to St. Domingo call at Grand Turk every two weeks, the length of passage being five days.

There is a telephone exchange at Grand Turk with about 25 miles of wires.

The rate of letter postage is 2d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3d. per ounce.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1898, the station being at Grand Turk. The rates are per word: To England 2s. 4½d., to Jamaica 1s., to Halifax 1s. 6½d.

A new cable was laid in 1924 connecting Grand Turk with Barbados.

Communication between Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the Turks Islands and Cockburn Harbour has been established by wireless telephone. The station at Grand Turk is also a telegraphic one with a sending range of about 500 miles.

Education.

In 1921 a secondary school was opened at Grand Turk and controlled by a Board of Management appointed by the Commissioner. This school receives an annual government grant of 150l., and other revenue is derived from school fees.

There are ten elementary schools supported by Government, with 787 pupils enrolled in 1923 and an average attendance of 555. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of five shillings, ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1923, 943 depositors, with 16,932l. deposits.
Constitution.

The Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.
