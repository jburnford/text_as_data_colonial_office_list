BRITISH GUIANA.

Situation and Area.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 270 miles, and from north to south about 540 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequeibo, and Berbice, and is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyne, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and north-east by the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is about 89,464 square miles, extending from 9° to 1° north latitude, and from 57° to 61° west longitude. About 275 square miles only are under cultivation.

The western boundary was till 1899 in dispute with Venezuela. The Dutch, while British Guiana was in their possession, claimed the whole watershed of the Essequibo river, while the Venezuelans asserted that the Spanish province of Guayana extended up to the Essequibo itself. Various attempts were made to settle the question by negotiation, but without result; and in 1896 Her Majesty's Government, without prejudice to their claim to the whole territory held by their Dutch predecessors in title, declared definitely that they would not allow any advance on the part of Venezuela beyond the boundary recommended by Sir R. Schomburgk, who surveyed it in 1842-43, as a good natural boundary, well within the limits which Great Britain might have rightfully claimed. Shortly after this, in 1897, Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Great Britain, which were only resumed in 1897 after arbitration on the territory in dispute had been agreed upon between the British and Venezuelan Governments by a treaty dated 2nd February, 1897. The tribunal constituted by the treaty—composed of two judges of the High Court of England, two judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, with Professor de Martens as President—met at Paris on 15th June, 1899, and after hearing arguments by counsel on both sides gave their decision in favour of a line not greatly differing from the Schomburgk line, though they awarded to Venezuela Point Barima and the immediately adjacent land and the district between the Wenamu and the upper reaches of the Cuyuni.

A further claim to the southern portion of the western boundary was made by Brazil; and the Paris tribunal, while pronouncing in favour of the British claim at this part of the line, expressly reserved the rights of Brazil. This matter had been the subject of negotiation since 1843, and after renewed and partly successful attempts to settle the question completely by negotiation, the more important difference was referred to the arbitration of the King of Italy by a treaty of November, 1901. The proceedings in this case were entirely written, and were completed in February, 1904. The judgment of the King of Italy was given on 14th June, 1904, and resulted in the establishment of the British title to about half the area which His Majesty's Government claimed against Brazil. Great Britain retained everything to the east of the Mahu or Ireng and the Upper Takutu, including the Savannah country of the Macousi and Wapisianas. Brazil was awarded the country between the Mahu and Cotinga.

History and Constitution.

The coast line of the country between the Rivers Amazon and Orinoco was first traced by Spanish sailors in 1498 and 1500; and, during the 16th and early 17th centuries, the search for the fabulous city of Eldorado stimulated exploration of this region. The territory was first partially settled in 1616 by Dutch merchants, who erected a fort and depot at Fort Kykoveral in the present county of Essequibo. This colony subsequently came under the control of the Dutch West India Company, which was formed in 1621. In 1624 a settlement was founded on the Berbice by Van Peere, a Flushing merchant, and held by him under a license from the Company. The first English attempt at settlement was made by Captain Charles Leigh on the Oapock river (now French Guiana) in 1604. The effort, though followed up by Robert Harcourt in 1613 and 1627, failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, also turned his attention to Guiana, and founded a settlement in Surinam in 1650, which was captured by the Dutch in 1667, and ceded to them at the peace of Breda in exchange for New York. The Dutch retained their hold on the three colonies with more or less firmness, now yielding to England, now to France or Portugal, till 1796, when during the war of the French Revolution they were captured by a British Fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, and finally ceded to that Power in 1814.

In 1745 colonists from Essequibo settled on the Demerara River, and in 1773 Demerara was constituted a separate colony, but in 1784 it was reunited under one government with Essequibo, Berbice being under a separate government, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732. Under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Essequibo appears to have been established very early in the history of the Colony. Until 1773, Demerara was represented on it. In 1773 a separate Court of Policy was set up for the latter, but provision was made for representatives of the two Courts of Policy to form a Combined Council, and the two bodies were merged in 1789, when the two Colonies of Essequibo and Demerara were united. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government and the West India Company as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1787, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution) was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government and established a new one for the conjoined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and 1803, the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before.

The Council or Court of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander
of Essequibo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequibo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequibo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each County,* each consisting of seven Members elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin d'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned or ceased to be an inhabitant.

In 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds. In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon annulled this arrangement, and to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation enacted that in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when the three provinces were united, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.†

The colonial members never acquiesced in this interpretation of the constitution, and there were frequent collisions between the Executive and Elective sections of the Court.‡ The position the Elective section assumed was based upon the construction of a passage in a decree of the States-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves"; and a passage in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793. "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists—for example, the 'Kiezers of both rivers.'" The nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806 has also been held to support this contention.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty; and from that date till 1891 the only constitutional legislation was the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory Act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution, as it existed up to 1891, may be summed up very briefly. It consisted of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The unofficial members of the Combined Court and Court of Policy were chosen by a College of Electors. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly were performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which were dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passed all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which was passed by the Combined Court.

During 1891 an Act was passed, which came into force in 1892, effecting a considerable change in the constitution. By this Act the administrative functions of the Court of Policy were transferred to an executive council, and the duties of the former became purely legislative.

The College of Electors was abolished, and the unofficial members have since been elected by the direct vote of the whole body of electors.

The Combined Court had the power of (1) imposing the Colonial taxes and auditing the public accounts; and (2) discussing freely and without reserve the items on the annual estimates prepared by the Governor in Executive Council; it could reduce or reject, but not increase, any item. The first of these powers was bestowed in 1796, when Governor Beaujon called the financial representatives into being, "with a right of voting only for the raising of colonial taxes and not further"; while the second was conferred periodically by His Majesty's Order in Council after each renewal of the Civil List and was co-existent with the Civil List.

The Court of Policy consisted of the Governor, seven official members, and eight elected members. It could be prorogued or dissolved at any time by the Governor and in any case was dissolved at the end of five years, and a general election had to be held within two months of the date of dissolution. The number of financial representatives, who with the Court of Policy formed the Combined Court, was 6.

In 1928, by an Act of Parliament, it was enacted that it should be lawful for His Majesty in Council to create and constitute, in substitution for the existing Legislature, a Legislature for the Colony of British Guiana in such form and with such powers as His Majesty in Council might determine, and from time to time to alter and amend the constitution of the Legislature and any powers thereof; and that any such Order in Council might provide that, notwithstanding the powers conferred on the Legislature thereby, there should be reserved to or conferred on His Majesty full power by Order in Council from

‡ During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.
time to time to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony of British Guiana.

Pursuant to this Act, an Order of the King in Council providing for the Government of the Colony and for the constitution of a Legislative Council, was brought into operation on 18th July, 1928. The Court of Policy and Combined Court were thereby abolished and their powers were given to the new Legislative Council. The new Council consists of the Governor as President, often Official Members and of nineteen Unofficial Members. The Colonial Secretary and Attorney-General are ex-officio members, and of the nineteen unofficial members, fourteen are elected and the remainder nominated by the Governor. The persons who were elected members of the Combined Court became under the Order in Council the first Elected Members of the Legislative Council. It was also provided that any matter requiring a vote of enactment of the Council might be decided by the Governor in Executive Council notwithstanding that such decision might be contrary to the vote of a majority of the Legislative Council; but in such a case effect cannot be given to the decision until the facts have been reported to the Secretary of State and his approval obtained.

Local Government.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated. The principle has now been materially extended in its application.

The existing municipal authorities are: mayor and town council, Georgetown; and mayor and town council, New Amsterdam. Their revenue in 1928 was respectively 173,902l. and 20,513l., and their expenditure 169,480l. and 20,140l. There are also 100 village and country districts, whose revenue and expenditure in 1928 were respectively 32,660l. and 31,983l.; in 1927 the figures were 27,310l. and 29,003l.

The Roman-Dutch law was in force in the Colony until 1st January, 1917, at which date the Civil Law of British Guiana Ordinance came into force. This enactment, along with two others, was the outcome of a Common Law Commission and Statute Law Committee. The Criminal Law is based upon that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that indictments are preferred by the Attorney General and there is no Grand Jury.

Internal Communications.

The three rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable for 90, 35, and 150 miles respectively. Beyond these distances, owing to the nature of the country, they abound in cataracts and waterfalls. There is a good network of roads, and there are small canals in connection with the Demerara River. There is a railway from Georgetown to Rosignol on the Berbice River, 60½ miles in length, and one from Vreed-en-Hoop on the Demerara River to Parika on the Essequibo River, 18¼ miles in length, both lines having been constructed by the Demerara Railway Company at a total cost of 694,621l. St. ld. The Railways were acquired by the Colony from the Company in 1921 as from the 1st January, 1919, and are now operated by Government in conjunction with certain steamer services under the control of the Colonial Transport Department. The Colonial Government steamers operate ferries across the Demerara, Berbice and Essequibo Rivers and services from Georgetown to Adventure on the Essequibo Coast to Bartica at the junction of the Mazaruni and Essequibo Rivers, to Mount Everard in the North-West District and to Pickersgill on the Pomeroon River and also from New Amsterdam to Paradise on the Berbice River. Launch services are also run by the Department on the Canje, and Pomeroon-Moruka Rivers.

A railway, 18¼ miles in length, owned by a local company, connects Wismar on the Demerara River with Rockstone on the Essequibo River. A steamer service is also operated from Georgetown to Wismar on the Demerara River.

The postal telegraph system comprises about 574 miles of line, with 12 submarine cables, having a total length of 28¼ miles. The Colony is in telegraph communication with Barbados, and through Barbados with the United Kingdom, Canada, North America and other parts of the world over cables maintained by the Pacific Cable Board (All Red Route). Communication with the British West Indies generally is maintained by the Pacific Cable Board's cable to Barbados and thence by wireless.

The principal tariffs are:

- To the United Kingdom... 2s. 4d. per word.
- To Eastern Canada... 1s. 6d. "
- To Western Canada... 1s. 8½d. "

There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

The wireless station in Georgetown is in communication with six stations in the interior, and also with ships and points outside the Colony.

There is a Direction Finding Station at Georgetown.

There is an up-to-date Postal Telephone Service in the Colony, with Exchanges in Georgetown, Queenstown, New Amsterdam and nine of the larger villages, including three semi-automatic exchanges.

Two separate police exchanges are maintained in Georgetown and one in New Amsterdam.

A full automatic exchange was opened at Queenstown on 29th June, 1928.

Length of telegraph and telephone trunk lines 1,038 miles. Telephone lines in Exchange area's 3,914 miles. Aerial cables 14 miles. Submarine cables 28¼ miles.

Roads have been also opened by the Government between the Barima and Barama rivers, between the Potaro and Konawuruk rivers, from Bartica towards the Kaburi creek between the Essequibo and Mazaruni; and a road has been constructed by private enterprise between Cartabo point on the Mazaruni River to the Puruni River. A cattle trail 182 miles long extends from Takama on the Berbice River, picking up a branch from Arakwa Creek on the Demerara River, to Annai on the Rupurruri River, whence the open savannah extends for a further 129 miles to Dadanawa. A well-organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 24 hours from Georgetown, and the North-Western District in 36 hours. Georgetown and New Amsterdam are lighted by electricity; and in the former there is an efficient electric tram service on the overhead trolley system.

Education.

A State-aided system of elementary education was established by Law No. 3 of 1876.

The elementary schools are denominational. The central administration is vested in a Director and Education Committee, and the local control in managers, who are usually ministers of religion.
The number of schools receiving aid in 1928 was 261, with 44,927 scholars, and the aid granted amounted to 77,530L.

Provision is made for the higher education of boys by a Government college in Georgetown, in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England. Three secondary schools for girls, one for boys and one for boys and girls receive grants-in-aid from the Government and there is awarded annually one public scholarship of the value of 900L, open to boys and girls and tenable at a University or College in the British Empire. Twelve Scholarships, entitling the holders to free education at the Government College or at other approved schools, are granted to scholars of the elementary schools. In 1924-25 the whole system of education in the Colony was investigated by a Commission. Important changes were recommended, and are being made as opportunity arises.

A Teachers' Training Centre was established in September, 1928.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. British sterling and United States gold coin is current and legal tender.

On the 16th August, 1915, the Combined Court approved of the issue of Government Currency Notes of the face value of $1$4s. 2d., and $2$8s. 4d. The first notes were issued in January, 1917; and on the 31st December, 1928, there were Notes in circulation to the face value of 104,166L.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and Royal Bank of Canada have establishments at Georgetown, with branches at New Amsterdam, Berbice. The former, on the 31st December, 1928, had a note circulation in British Guiana of 127,366L, and the Royal Bank of Canada 96,533L. The total note circulation in the Colony on the 31st December, 1928, was 328,055L.

The first Government savings banks were established at Georgetown and New Amsterdam in the year 1836. There are 52 Post Office Savings Banks. At the end of 1928 these banks had 36,354 depositors, with 374,744L to their credit.

The Combined Court in November, 1910, passed a resolution approving of the amalgamation of the two Banks, and authorising the transfer of the Government Savings Bank to the Post Office on the 1st July, 1911.

The British Guiana Bank, now the Royal Bank of Canada, opened a Savings Bank Department when this amalgamation took place, and a considerable amount of business went into their hands. The Colonial Bank has also since opened a Savings Bank department.

Industry and Productions.

The staple products of British Guiana are sugar, rum, molasses, molassuit, concentrated lime juice, rice, coconuts, coconut-oil, copra, coffee, balata and rubber. Sugar and rice are the chief industries of the Colony. Sugar and its by-products furnish 61 per cent. in value of the total exports. Timber—including the famous Demerara Greenheart, which is unrivalled for underwater structures, piling, etc., and Mora, which is becoming increasingly known and valued for railway sleepers—charcoal and hides are also exported. There are 32 sugar estates in active operation, with a total area of 154,868 acres, of which 57,625 are under sugar, 44,359 under rice, and 52,863 under other cultivation, and the remainder used as pasture lands or uncultivated.

The forests, with which the interior of the colony is covered, abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, and for railway sleepers, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of household furniture.

During 1928, 116,484 tons of sugar, 1,746,293 pt. gallons of rum, and 2,062 tons of molassuit or cattle foods were produced. The bulk of the production is high-class vacuum pan sugar for refining purposes, while certain quantities of the far-famed "Demerara Crystals" are still exported.

Coconuts, coffee and cacao are grown on the alluvial soils on the banks of the rivers.* Rice is now grown to a considerable extent, chiefly by free coolies, on the low lands within the empoldered areas. Rice exported, 1928, milled, 18,063 tons, valued at 232,114L, and unmilled, Nil tons, valued at Nil. The development of the minor industries is receiving considerable attention.

Gold and diamond working is carried on by about 4,400 diggers. The diamonds exported during 1928 amounted to 132,482 carats, valued at 523,006L.

The values of the principal exports besides sugar (114,687 tons valued at 1,692,639L) and rice are:—Bauxite, 174,920L; gold, 15,864L; timber, 21,752L; balata, 53,635L; charcoal, 9,876L; firewood, 6,407L; coconuts, 1,237L; lumber, 4,309L.

The chief imports are beef, pork, cheese, butter, cornmeal, flour, machinery, dried fish, manure, tobacco, oils, earthenware, glass and hardware, cutlery, textiles, spirits, wines and malt liquors.

Forty-one per cent. of the trade is with the United Kingdom, 30 per cent. with Canada, and 9 per cent. with the United States; the other important countries being British West Indies, Holland and Dutch Guiana.

Climate.

The climate is a pleasant one for a tropical country, its characteristics being more sub-tropical than tropical. The mean temperature throughout the year is 80-4° Fahr., the mean maximum being about 84-8° Fahr., and the mean minimum 75° Fahr. The heat, which is greatly tempered by cooling breezes from the sea prevailing during the greater portion of the year, is felt more from July to October than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes. There are annually two wet seasons, from June to the end of August and during December, January and February. The annual rainfall for the past 80 years averages about 87 inches in Georgetown. The rainfall in 1925 was 63-25 inches, the lowest recorded since 1899, as compared with 96-48 inches in the year 1928.

Towns.

The capital is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 30" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing an estimated population of 57,302 in 1928. New Amsterdam has a population of 8,838. Both these are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1928, 34 vessels, of a total tonnage of 4,291.

Means of Communication.

The mail communication between the Colony and the United Kingdom is very irregular, but nevertheless there are many opportunities.

* The cocoa estates are chiefly on the banks of the Demerara River, and on Canal No. 1, West Bank. Coffee was grown principally in the county of Berbice, and Liberian coffee has been planted with great success on estates on Canal No. 1 and in the Pomeroon and North-West Districts.
The steamers of the Harrison and Bookers Lines are used, also via Trinidad:

- English—Elder and Fyffe Ltd. Line.
- French—Plymouth and St. Nazaire Line.
- Dutch—Colon Line via Havre-Dutch-Surinam Line.

Mails for North America are received and despatched fairly regularly by the following steamers:
- Canadian National Steamships, Trinidad Shipping Company and via Trinidad by Lamport and Holt Line.
