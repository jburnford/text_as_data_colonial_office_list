NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprised the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitang River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of about 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern frontier was delimited in 1912-1913 by an Anglo-Dutch boundary commission, whose report was confirmed by a treaty at London on the 28th September, 1915.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,800 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at present at Sandakan. Other stations are at Semporna, Lamag, Beluran, Kudat, Langkon, Kotabrud, Tuaran, Jesselton, Penampang, Papar, Beaufort, Mempakul, Sipitang, Tenom, Keningau, Tambunan, Ranau, and Pensiangan.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The country is mountainous. The highest point is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who at the Census taken in 1921 numbered about 257,804, are mainly Bruneis, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade. Further back, the Dusuns, the most numerous native race in North Borneo, cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the uplands they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt. The Muruts, another interior tribe, are numerous; formerly they varied more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting but are now peaceable. The Chinese population is steadily increasing and is now estimated to be not far short of 60,000; they form the trading, gardening and artisan section of the community. There is a State-aided scheme of Chinese immigration. Europeans number about 500. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of 12,000. There are several missions, including the Church of England, with stations at Sandakan, Kudat, and Jesselton, and the Roman Catholic with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast and eighteen schools in various parts of the country. The Church of England, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission has twelve schools, the principal ones being at Jesselton, Sandakan, Kudat, and Papar. Government maintains a training school at Jesselton for the sons of Native Chiefs and eight vernacular schools at other places.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain;
cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper, and tea. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar),

Means of Communication

The Straits Steamship Company runs every week between Singapore and Sandakan. There is additional communication by...
Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain;
and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1855 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a Company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (afterwards Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 150 inches, according to situation.

Annual Mean Temperature... 81 degrees

Industry.

The principal products of the country are estate rubber, timber, tobacco, coal, copra, and cutch. The last decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of the rubber industry; exports of rubber increased from 3,939 tons in 1919 to 6,688 tons in 1928. The vast timber resources of the country form one of its principal assets, but until recently only the fringe of the forests was being worked. A Company was however formed in 1920 for more adequate timber exploitation with modern lumbering apparatus. Timber is being exported in increasing quantities to China, Australia, and England; the exports in 1928 were valued at 247,268L At Sandakan two large steam driven sawmills have been working for some years and a modern band sawmill has been installed. An electrically driven sawmill was recently installed in Sandakan. Tobacco was formerly the principal article of export. Exports of tobacco were valued at 116,663L in 1928. Coal exports 1928, 60,547L. The number of coconut plantations has rapidly increased, and exports of copra have risen considerably in value; exports of copra in 1928 were valued at 100,679L. Cutch, a tanning material obtained from the bark of certain mangrove trees, is manufactured at Sandakan; exports in 1928, 31,504L Agriculture is now beyond the primitive state and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper, and tea. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, etc., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself directly engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, excise, quit rents, licences, royalties, poll tax, and other usual sources of revenue.

Development.

Sandakan on the East and Jesselton on the West are the principal ports. Both towns have developed rapidly, and are now supplied with electric light and cold storage. Considerable sums have been spent by Government on reclamation, improvement of water supplies, etc., at both ports.

Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports. Sandakan is also rapidly becoming of importance as a coaling station for ocean liners. Gold in alluvial form is found in certain of the rivers on the East Coast.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. Indications of the presence of petroleum occur in many parts of the State, but so far it has not been found to exist in commercial quantity; prospecting work is still proceeding.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent, and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars. A State Bank of North Borneo has been established with head office at Sandakan, and a branch office at Jesselton. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Bank of Taiwan.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are four Residencies, viz., the Sandakan and Kudat, West Coast, Tawau, and Interior Residencies.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based upon Indian law and the principal Indian Codes have been adopted in the State. Many enactments of the Straits Settlements also have been incorporated in local Ordinances. Courts of law are correlative to the Indian Courts under the Indian Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, while there are Imams' Courts for the administration of Moslem matrimonial law, and Native Courts to deal with matters of native custom.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every week between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with
Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, and a local company maintains a service along the coast and to the Philippine Islands. There is also regular steamship communication between the port of Tawau and ports in the Dutch East Indies. The State Railway on the West Coast, which is a metre gauge line, connects Jesselton with Beaufort, 57 miles distant. At Beaufort the line divides, one section proceeding to the port of Weston (20 miles), the other to Uelalap in the interior (40 miles). In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 124 miles. At Jesselton there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. There is a first class metalled road 20 miles long from Jesselton to Tuaran; another proceeds from Sandakan in a north-westerly direction, 11 miles of metalling have been completed and the road is being advanced by 2-3 miles annually. Road construction is being pushed forward in other localities of the State. There is a system of bridle-paths covering a total distance of 640 miles. Wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, Sebatik, Lahad Datu, and Lamag. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about thirty days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 6 cents per oz.; foreign countries, 12 cents for the first oz., 6 cents each succeeding oz.

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, Sebatik, Lahad Datu, and Lamag. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan, and Kudat.

SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 600,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 500 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjung Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1884 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1904. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33'10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses hospitals and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 450 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Mission have stations at various other places all over the Country.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Mukia, a large town on the Mukia River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

**TRANS-JORDAN.**

A strip of country fringing the Syrian desert and extending from Syria in the north to the Gulf of Akaba in the south forms the territory known as Trans-Jordan. It is divided from Palestine by the River Jordan and the Dead Sea.

The frontier between Nejd and Trans-Jordan starts in the north-east from the point of intersection of meridian 39°E. and parallel 32°N., which marks the termination of the frontier between Nejd and Iraq, and proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 37°E. and parallel 31°30'N., and thence along meridian 37°E. to the point of its intersection with parallel 31°25'N. From this point, it proceeds in a straight line to the point of intersection of meridian 38°E. and parallel 30°N., leaving all projecting edges of the Wadi Sirhan in Nejd Territory, and thence proceeds along meridian 38°E. to the point of its intersection with parallel 29°35'N.

The southern boundary of Trans-Jordan is yet to be defined.

The northern portion of Trans-Jordan consists of elevated country, rising to 3,000 to 4,000 feet above sea level, which on the western margin falls abruptly to the narrow fertile plain of the Jordan valley, and on the eastern falls more gradually to grass lands through which runs the Hejaz Railway line and which gradually merged into the desert.

The grass land strip forms the summer pastures of Bedouin tribes who in the winter move further east for pasturage. West of the railway are the wheat and barley lands of the Kerak, Balqa and Ajlun tribes as well as of the Circassian colonies in the Balqa and the numerous Arab villages in the north. Perennial water is found in the deep lateral valleys which is used for the irrigation of cultivable land in the valleys themselves, and subsequently waters relatively large areas of the fertile land of the Jordan depression which are cultivated by semi-nomad tribes. The remainder of this depression is used by these tribes as winter grazing grounds. In the north there are a number of large villages, but the only towns of any size are Amman, Salt and Kerak.

No census has been taken but the population is believed to be between 200,000 and 300,000.

His Britannic Majesty is the Mandatory for Trans-Jordan, to which the terms of the Mandate for Palestine, with the exception of the provisions dealing with the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people, are applicable. The declaration of His Majesty's Government with regard to its Mandatory obligations in Trans-Jordan made to the Council of the League of Nations in September, 1922 (Cmd. 1785) was in the following terms:

"In the application of the Mandate to Trans-Jordan, the action which in Palestine is taken by the Administration of the latter country, will be taken by the Administration of Trans-Jordan under the general supervision of the Mandatory.

His Majesty's Government accept full responsibility as Mandatory for Trans-Jordan and undertake that such provision as may be made for the administration of that country in accordance with Article 25 of the Mandate shall be in no way inconsistent with those provisions of the Mandate which are not by this resolution declared inapplicable."

On the 20th February, 1928, an Agreement between His Britannic Majesty and his Highness the Amir for the purposes of setting up an independent and constitutional Government and placing His Britannic Majesty in a position to fulfil his international obligations in respect of Trans-Jordan, was signed by the representatives of the High Contracting Parties and an Organic Law thereupon came into force provisionally, pending the ratification of the Agreement after its acceptance by the Legislative Council provided for in the Law.

The Legislative Council, consisting of six official and sixteen elected members, met for the first time on the 2nd April, 1929, and accepted the Agreement during its first session.

The Mandatory is represented in Trans-Jordan by the British Resident, assisted by a few British officers and a small clerical staff. The British Resident acts under the instructions of the High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, who is also the High Commissioner for Palestine.

A local Arab Administration has been formed under His Highness the Emir Abdullah ibn Hussein, G.B.E., K.C.M.G. (son of ex-King Husain of the Hejaz and brother of King Faisal of Iraq).

Amman is the capital, while Salt, Kerak, Irbid and Ma'an are headquarters of District Governors.

The Ottoman Code is in operation with but few changes. The official language is Arabic.

The system of taxation is unchanged from the Turkish, although additional contributions have been levied for special educational or religious purposes. In its incidence, however, taxation has been most uneven, for it is only in the Balqa that the tithe is collected, while Kerak and Irbid pay a specific sum in commutation.

Palestine pays Trans-Jordan an annual sum of £P.25,500 on account of the Customs Duties collected on goods of foreign origin which are re-exported to Trans-Jordan. The Trans-Jordan Government refunds, however, the duties collected at Amman on goods imported through Palestine in transit, under a special convention. The Syrian Government also refunds the duty collected on articles of foreign origin when re-exported to Trans-Jordan; and Trans-Jordan in addition collects a further small percentage of the value of the goods as assessed at Damascus. Until May, 1924, the import duty into Syria was 11 per cent., but was then raised to 15 per cent. on goods exported from States members of the League of Nations, and to 30 per cent. on others. Trans-Jordan collects a specific additional excise duty on imported alcohol and tobacco.
Until 1926, public security in Trans-Jordan was maintained by a locally-recruited force known as the Arab Legion and a number of civil police in the larger towns. In 1926 these forces were reorganised. A military force called the Trans-Jordan Frontier Force was raised in Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the defence of the two territories, and police duties in Trans-Jordan were entrusted to a civil police force, to which the old name of the Arab Legion was given.
