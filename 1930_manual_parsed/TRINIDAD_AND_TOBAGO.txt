TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 56' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 50 miles, and its average breadth 37½ miles, and its area is 1,862 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict. c. 44. on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago at the census of 1921 was 365,913. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 128,970. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of six members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted by Letters Patent and an Order in Council which came into operation on 21st August, 1924. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and not more than nine other official members, and of not more than six nominated unofficial members and seven elected members. Trinidad is divided into six electoral districts, each returning one member. Tobago forms the seventh electoral district.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The climate of Trinidad is tropical and may be divided into two seasons, a dry season from January to the middle of May, with an average rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December, with an average of 8 inches per month. The coolest months of the year are December to April. The average temperature during the day is 84 and during the night 74. The average rainfall in 1928, from records taken at 98 stations, was 63·24 ins. The climate is healthy and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided reasonable precautions are taken. Hurricanes are unknown.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the
Petroleum.—At the close of 1928 there were fifteen companies actively engaged in the exploitation of oil in the Colony. These companies, having a total share capital of more than two hundred million dollars, have sunk approximately two hundred wells throughout the whole extent of the Colony in various depths up to thirty-five feet.

Among these companies we may mention, Without arriving at any conclusion, the following:

Columbia Oil Company.

Congelé Corporation.

Southern Texas Oil Company.

American Oil Exploration Corporation.

Republic Oil Exploration Corporation.

Ashley Associated Oil Corporation.

Jaguar Oil Company.

cast and west, the most northerly fringing the


north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao, and coconuts, which are its staples.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1921, 61,580), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1928, 38 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 6,366 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

Production and Industry.

The quantity and value of the principal products exported during the year 1928 were:

| Quantity | Value |

| Refined Kerosene | 539,193 | 17,773 |

Sugar.—The sugar crop yielded 81,551 tons in 1928.

Canes are grown not only by the Estates but also by Cane Farmers, who sell usually on a sliding scale, to the Factories.

Coconuts.—The coconut industry continues to expand. The value of the exports of coconuts, copra and coconut oil in 1928 being 274,239£ compared with 190,296£ in 1927.

Asphalt.—The asphalt lake, 114 acres in extent, situated in the Ward of La Brea, was first leased as a whole in 1888 for 21 years. The lease was renewed for a further period of 21 years from the 1st February, 1909. In February, 1925, a fresh lease of the lake comprising 109 acres was made to the Trinidad Lake Asphalt, Limited, for 21 years, from the 1st February, 1930, on payment of the following Royalties and Export Duties:

For each ton of Crude Pitch or Asphaltum a Royalty of 2s. 6d. and an Export Duty of 6s.

For each ton of Dried Pitch or Asphalatum a Royalty of 3s. 6d. and an Export Duty of 6s. 11d.

The quantity of Asphalt produced during 1928 was 195,980 tons as against 241,131 tons in 1927.

The quantity of Asphalt exported during 1928 was 152,287½ tons of the value of 402,564£, and yielding a revenue of 75,631£, as compared with 186,363½ tons exported in 1927 of a value of 464,475£ and yielding a revenue of 90,667£.

Petroleum.—At the close of 1928 there were fifteen Companies actively engaged in the exploitation of oil in the Colony. These Companies, having a total share capital of more than 14,000,000£, held over 150,000 acres of Crown Lands under licenses and leases, of which approximately 115,000 acres were held under mining lease. In addition, appreciable areas of private lands are held. Up to 17th January, 1902, oil rights were not reserved by the Government when disposing of Crown Land, but after that year all Crown grants reserve the oil rights to the Crown. There are, consequently, three categories of oil lands, viz., lands disposed of prior to 1902 in which the oil rights rest in the surface owner. Land sold since that date in which the oil rights are reserved to the Crown, and lands where both the surface and the underlying oil remain the property of the Crown.

The principal oil producing companies are the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Fyzabad, Barrackpore, etc.; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Point Fortin, Parry Lands, etc.; the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Petroleum Development Company, Limited, from Crown Lands in the Ward of Oropuche; the Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and Private Lands at Fyzabad; the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaquite; the Kern (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Guapo, the Trinidad Oilfields Operating Co., Ltd., from private lands at Palo Seco, Fyzabad and San Francique, the Trinidad Petroleum Development Co., Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Naparima, Palo Seco and Cedros, the Venezuelan Consolidated Oilfields, Ltd, from private lands at Fyzabad, and the Fyzabad Dome Oilfields from private lands at Fyzabad. There are four refineries at work in the Colony situated at Pointe-a-Pierre, Point Fortin, Brighton and Tabaquite, and all grades of petroleum products from petrol to road oil are produced. The total quantity of oil produced during 1928 was 268,955,750 gallons, an increase of 80,639,510 gallons over the production for 1927. Of this total, 144,963,560 gallons were from Crown Lands or lands in which the oil rights belonged to the Crown. The Royalty paid by operating companies on oil, won from Crown rights during the year 1928, amounted to 64,573£, as against 39,965£ in 1927, and wyealves to 12,611£, as against 14,560£ in 1927. The quantity of crude oil and products exported amounted to 222,658,646 gallons valued at 2,493,290£, as against 155,986,964 gallons valued at 2,326,361£ in 1927.

Fruit.—Increased attention is being given to the possibility of establishing an export trade in fruit. A Fruit Growers' Association has been formed for the purpose of developing the fruit industry. Exports during the year 1928 were valued at 1,357£.

The cultivation of Para rubber has been successfully carried out on one estate.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,267,236 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1928, was estimated to be approximately 693,477 acres. About 314,086 acres are under cultivation; 572,928 acres remain ungranted.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. About one-third, and one-fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom, and the United States of America respectively.
The following table gives the direction of the import trade for the last five years.

Municipalities.

In 1914 Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.

The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1921 was 10,610.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1921 census, 4,210). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1928, was £164,677., the expenditure, £160,867., and the debt, boroughs of San Fernando and Arima excepted, was £272,270l. on the 31st December, 1928. This includes the loan of £4,000l. for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly Coastal Steamship Service between Trinidad and Tobago by the Steamer "Belize," going every alternative week by the northern and southern routes, and calling at all the principal ports, this Service was previously run by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Limited, but in March, 1923, the Government purchased the s.s. "Belize," and until July, 1927, ran the Service through local Agents. Since 1st July, 1927, the Government have run the service themselves.

The railway was commenced by a line between Port of Spain and Arima, 16 miles, opened in 1876, and by subsequent extensions the railway system now consists of the following:—

The Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grandeline (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast.

The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1890, San Fernando in 1892, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.

The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabaquite in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction (14½ miles from Port of Spain) and running in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.

The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Marabella Junction (33 miles from Port of Spain) and running in an easterly direction to Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles, and

The Cipero tramway, to the south of San Fernando, also proceeding by another route to Princes Town, which, with branches (13 miles), was merged into the railway system in 1912.

The line between Port of Spain and St. Joseph (7½ miles) has been doubled.

The total length of this system is now 123 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 6 trains daily each way.

In connection with the railway, a steamer makes one trip a week between Port-of-Spain, San Fernando and La Brea (near the celebrated Pitch Lake), the Oilfields, Cedros, and to the south-western point of the Island at Isacos, stopping at eight intermediate places along the coast, and carrying passengers and goods. This steamer also makes three trips a week each way between Port-of-Spain and the Bocas entrance to the Gulf, including the Islands to the West of Port-of-Spain.

The railway stations are in telegraphic communication one with the other on all parts of the system, giving a total length of about 118 miles of telegraph and about 14 miles of telephone lines. There is also a service telephone along the Caparo Section between San Fernando and Princes Town.

The total receipts from the railways, railway steamers, telegraphs and telephones for the year 1928 amounted to £156,351l., and the working expenses to £167,235l., exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to £1,222l. There has been a considerable
falling off in the Railway receipts during the last few years, which is due to competition from motor omnibuses and lorries.

The total number of passengers carried during 1923 was 1,127,585. The total tonnage of goods (including canes, 166,732 tons) was 361,624 tons.

The Island is intersected by numerous roads either metalled or gravelled, and capable of carrying fairly heavy motor traffic. Many of the most important roads have been reconstructed in recent years, and their surfaces treated with Trinidad Road Oil or Trinidad Road Binder. This method of construction is being steadily pursued. The total mileage of roadway is 2,332.44, of which 1,764.70 miles of main and local roads are under the control of the Public Works Department, and 577.74 miles of local roads are under the control of Road Boards.

There are numerous motor bus services plying along the Eastern Main Road between Port of Spain and Arima, and along the Southern Main Road between Port of Spain and San Fernando. These services are not continuous, individual owners plying for hire along different sections of the routes.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and 114 out-offices throughout the Colony.

Communication by cable with the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and other parts of the world is maintained by the Pacific Cable Board (All Red Route) and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company.

The Pacific Cable Board established their service in the West Indies during the year 1924, and opened their offices for business on the 1st December of the same year.

Their cables run from Barbados to Turks Island, with spurs from the former place to Trinidad and Demerara. At Turks Island connection is made with the Direct Company's cable to Halifax. Traffic is handed back to the Pacific Cable Board's Office at Halifax and thence via Imperial Cables, an all British line of communication thus being established to England.

The system was established and is owned jointly by the Imperial Government, the Government of Canada and the Governments of the various West Indian Colonies. Apart from the main cables, wireless stations are maintained at all the smaller Colonies, communicating with a central station at Barbados, where traffic is transferred to the cables.

A wireless system of communication is also maintained between the following Islands—Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenada, Carriacou, St. Lucia, Dominica, Antigua, Montserrat and St. Kitts.

The principal tariffs are:

To the United Kingdom from Port-of-Spain ... 2/4 per word
To Eastern Canada ... 1/6
To Western Canada ... 1/8

There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

The West India and Panama Telegraph Company, has a duplicate cable system. Both cables on leaving Trinidad touch at Grenada where they separate until they meet again at St. Lucia, Porto Rico, Jamaica and terminate at Santiago, Cuba, where the Company hand over their traffic to the Cuba Submarine Company who in turn at Havana hand over to the West Union Telegraph Company which has a duplicate cable system to New York.

The Company's cables connect with the French Cable Company's line at Guadeloupe and Porto Rico, which proceeds to New York via Hayti. In addition their lines connect with the Direct West Indian Cable Company's (called the All British route) Line at Jamaica, which proceeds from there to Bermuda, Halifax and the United Kingdom.

The Pacific Cable Board system has no wireless station in Trinidad, but three wireless stations are maintained by the Trinidad Government, namely Port-of-Spain, North Post and Tobago. The North Post Station deals exclusively with ship and Tobago traffic, while communication with British Guiana, St. Martin, Venezuela and Paramaribo is carried out by Port-of-Spain.

Steamers calling at Trinidad comprised the following lines:—Elders and Fyffes, Leyland Line, Harrison Line, Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, Navigazione Generale Italiana, Trinidad Line (Furness Withy and Coy., Ltd.) Lamport and Holt, Munson, Prince Line, Ocean Dominion Steamship Corporation, Transatlantica Italiana, Royal Netherlands West India Mail, Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Aluminium Line, Orinoco Line, Nourse Line, Hamburg-Amerika Line, American Brazil Line and the Horne Line. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by these steamers.

In addition an increasing number of steamers call to load oil cargoes, or to take in coal or fuel oil for bunker purposes. During the winter months a number of tourist ships call.

The Government acquired in May, 1910, the floating graving dock and workshops formerly worked by the Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company under agreement with the Government, and the concern was, up to the 30th June, 1921, carried on by the Government as a business administration. On 1st July, 1921, the administration was dissolved, and the Dock and Workshops placed under the control of the Public Works Department. The dock, which is established in the harbour off Chaguaramas, has an over-all length of 385 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet (which can be increased to 68 feet). All kinds of ship repairs (hull and machinery) are also undertaken by the administration. Its lifting power is 4,000 tons.

The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

Within Colony ... ... ... 1d.
To U.K., India and British Colonies, also U.S.A., for 1st oz. ... ... 1d.
and for each additional oz. or fraction of oz. ... ... ... 1d.
To other places, for 1st oz. ... ... 3d.
and for each additional oz. ... ... 1½d.

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government and in dollars by the public, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance providing for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been
issued, the total value in circulation at 31st December, 1928, amounting to 122,300L.

Government Savings Banks are established in 34 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1928, was 33,625, with deposits amounting to 469,640L. The savings banks are largely used made up by the East Indians, of whom at the 31st December, there were 12,072 depositors. The amount deposited by this section of the community during the year is estimated at 96,056L.

The Commercial Banks are (1) Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., with an authorized note circulation in the Colony estimated at 1,500,000L; (2) the Royal Bank of Canada, with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of 1,500,000L; (3) The Canadian Bank of Commerce, with an authorized note circulation of £750,000; (4) Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have Savings bank branches and pay the same rate of interest as is paid by the Government Savings Bank, viz., 3 per cent. The Bank of Messrs. Gordon Grant and Co., Limited, is not a bank of issue. In addition to the above Banks there is the Trinidad Co-operative Bank, an institution established in 1924, for the encouragement of thrift.

Education.

At the close of 1928 there were 290 elementary and intermediate schools in the Colony, 46 being Government and 244 assisted schools. There were 254 schools in Trinidad and 36 in Tobago.

The number of pupils on the roll in December, 1928, was 62,927, of whom 34,338 were boys and 27,361 were girls. The average daily attendance was 38,970, or 61.9 per cent. of the number on roll. As compared with the previous year there was an increase of 1,228 on the roll, or 1.9 per cent., and of 606 in average attendance or 1.5 per cent. The number of teachers and pupil teachers employed was 1,728 (1,641 in 1927).

The total expenditure on education during the year 1928, deducting the amount received in school and examination fees, was 138,633L. 2s. 3d. as compared with 130,739L. 10s. 9½d. in 1927.

Secondary Education.

The following Colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys:-The Queen's Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary's College in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima College in San Fernando, the Bishop's High School in Tobago. The St. Joseph's Convent and the Bishop's High School in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima Girls' High School at San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen's Royal College, provide similar education for girls.

The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen's Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampesi procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Situation and Area.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,213 acres, of which about 56,090 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

Conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1921 was 23,378 according to census.

General Description.

Tobago is a Ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the Colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the Colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, live stock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1928 was £168,405.

The great progress made by Tobago in the last thirty-one years is shown by comparing the value of the chief products for 1897 and 1928:

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1897 | £1,671 |
| 1928 | £114,347 |

Miscellaneous items bring the total values to £14,503 in 1897 and £168,405 in 1928.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1921, of 773. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of a coastal steamer, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a large mileage of good roads and these are rapidly being extended and improved.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represents Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.
