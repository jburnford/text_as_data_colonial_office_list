CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 50' N. lat. and 79° 42' and 81° 53' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 270 miles; its greatest width 140 miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangamankanda on the east. Its area is 25,332 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldives Archipelago, 400 miles south-west of Ceylon, made up of 18 groups—known as atolls—or islets, but for centuries past arranged for administrative purposes in 13 groups, which are sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for nearly eight centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coconut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coconut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population enumerated at the census 1921 was 70,413, including 137 Indian Borahs, 22 Malabars, and 58 Ceylon Moors who were at Malé Island for purposes of trade; the principal occupations are fishing (14,760 males), coir and lace making (10,796 females and 13 males), toddy drawing (1,273 males), carpentry (1,133 males), and cultivation (853 males and 672 females). Malé, the residence of the Sultan and the capital of the Islands, is a little over 3 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate of Ceylon for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustan.

Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° F., and a noteworthy feature is the smallness of the variation both between day and night in the same twenty-four hours, and between the different parts of the year. At Kandy, 1,664 feet above sea level, the mean temperature is 76° F., and the rule of 1° F. drop in temperature for each 300 feet rise in altitude holds fairly well throughout the island.

At Colombo and Galle the mean monthly temperature in the coldest months (December and January) is less than four degrees below those in the warmest months (April and May), while the mean daily ranges for the year are 12·8° and 7·4° respectively.

At Trincomalee, on the other side of the island, conditions are only slightly more varied. The mean monthly temperature in May (86° F.) is seven degrees above that in December (79° F.), while the mean daily range for the year is 13·7° F.

It must be remembered, however, that the change in the capacity of the air for moisture for each degree of change of temperature in the Ceylon low country is far greater than the corresponding change per degree at the mean temperature of London.

The highest temperatures are experienced in the district to the north of the hills, and to the north-east, but it is only in a very few days in the year that a temperature of 100° Fahr. or over is experienced. Trincomalee holds the record with 103·7° Fahr. In the hills there is of course a great variety of climate, and at Nuwara Eliya, over 6,000 feet above mean sea level, frost is occasionally recorded in the early part of the year.

The annual average rainfall varies from below 40 inches in the dry zones to the north-west and south-east of the Island to above 150 inches at certain places on the south-west slopes of the hills. The chief rainy seasons extend from April to June and from October to January, but as there is a sharp antithesis between the windward and lee side during both monsoons (particularly the S.W.), it is hard to summarize the island as a whole in one sentence. It may fairly be said that there is not a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.
be divided into ten groups. Three of these groups will be left in charge of the Colonial Secretary (now Chief Secretary), the Attorney General, and the Treasurer. The remaining seven groups will be in charge of Members of the State Council who are elected as Chairmen of the various Executive Com-

Ceylon is the Island of the East. Its area is 25,332 square miles, about equal to Holland and Great Britain combined. It is an archipelago, 400 miles south-west of India, consisting of 18 groups—known as atolls—or islands, each group containing several islands. The island has been arranged for administration into five provinces.

It is hard to summarise the island as a whole in one sentence. It may fairly be said that there is not a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.
History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the sixth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the north of India established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

In the sixteenth century the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1796 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1802, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the Sinhalese Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island came under the rule of the British.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The present constitution of these Councils was settled by the Ceylon (Legislative Council) Orders in Council 1923 and 1924, and by Letters Patent and Instructions issued in 1920. The Executive Council consists of four ex-officio members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Controller of Revenue, and the Colonial Treasurer, and five other members, of whom four are unofficial. The Legislative Council consists of 49 members, including five ex-officio members, viz., the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Controller of Revenue, and the Treasurer, seven nominated official and three nominated unofficial members, and 34 elected unofficial members.

Of the elected members, eleven represent special interests and communities, viz., the European Electorate (Urban), 1; the European Electorate (Rural), 1; the Commercial Electorate, 1; the Burgher Electorate, 2; the Indian Electorate, 2; the Muslim Electorate, 3; the Western Province (Ceylon Tamil) Electorate, 1; and 23 represent territorial constituencies.

The nine Provinces are presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

As a result of the recommendations of a Special Commission appointed in 1927, a new Constitution has been approved by the Secretary of State and the Legislative Council, and will probably be put into operation during 1930. The Legislative Council will be replaced by a State Council consisting of 50 members elected for territorial constituencies, 3 ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, Attorney General, and Treasurer) to be called Officers of State, and 8 members nominated by the Governor. The State Council will concern itself with administration as well as with legislation.

The Departments of Government, instead of being under the supervision of the Colonial Secretary, will be divided into ten groups. Three of these groups will be left in charge of the Colonial Secretary (now Chief Secretary), the Attorney General, and the Treasurer. The remaining seven groups will be in charge of Members of the State Council who are elected as Chairmen of the various Executive Committees, and who will be styled Ministers. The Ministers with the Officers of State will form the Board of Ministers.

All Ceylonese, both male and female, of a minimum age of 21, are included in the franchise. British subjects not domiciled in Ceylon will be allowed to qualify for the franchise in accordance with the hitherto existing Constitution, or on their furnishing satisfactory evidence of five years' residence and a declaration of permanent settlement in the Island.

Population, Area, and Statistics.

According to the decennial census taken in 1921 the population was 4,604,549 an increase of 9-6 per cent. on the population enumerated in 1911. The details of the population were as follows (including the military, shipping, estates, and miscellaneous):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 1,251,639  |
| Central ditto              | 717,739    |
| Southern ditto             | 671,358    |
| Northern ditto             | 375,462    |
| Eastern ditto              | 192,947    |
| North-Western Province     | 492,287    |
| North-Central ditto        | 96,525     |
| Province of Uva            | 234,027    |
| Provinces of Sabaragamuwa  | 471,814    |
| Miscellaneous              | 751        |
| **Total**                 | **4,604,549** |

Among these were 8,937 Europeans, 29,632 Burghers and Eurasians, 3,016,659 Sinhalese, 1,121,018 Tamils, 286,876 Moors, 13,461 Malays, and 29,066 persons of other nationalities. The Buddhists (2,770,391) numbered more than half the population, there were 982,733 Hindus, 446,015 Christians (mostly Roman Catholic), 303,863 Muslims, and 2,547 other religionists. The population of the principal towns was as follows:—Colombo, 248,826; Negombo, 21,349; Moratuwa, 28,608; Kalutara, 13,596; Kandy, 32,662; Jaffna, 42,511; Galle, 39,157; Matare, 16,779; Batticaloa, 10,846; Trincomalee, 9,442; Kurunegala, 10,187; Badulla, 8,126.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea estates, etc., was about 600,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, was estimated at 569,000.

The entire area of the Colony is 25,332 square miles. About one quarter of this area, after deducting backwaters, etc., is under cultivation. Some 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,262 feet above sea level. The approximate acreages under the most important products are:

| Product       | Acres   |
|---------------|---------|
| Coconuts      | 879,000 |
| Rice          | 838,000 |
| Tea           | 457,000 |
| Grain (other than Rice) | 106,000 |
| Rubber        | 534,000 |
| Cinnamon      | 26,000  |
| Cacao         | 34,000  |
| Tobacco       | 14,000  |

At the end of 1928, the number of plumbago mines reported to be working was 51. The amount of plumbago exported during the year was 286,931 cwts., valued at rs. 2,704,359.

*By "Miscellaneous" are meant persons enumerated in trains and in the Great and Little Bases.*
The minimum upset price of Crown land is Rs. 16 to 20 per acre. 16,312 acres were sold in 1928 at an average price of Rs. 69 per acre.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack and Toddy Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt for the financial year 1927-28 was Rs. 1,239,461. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed on an import duty of Rs. 3 per cwt.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy and Galle, by the Provincial and District Road Committees, by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement and Urban District Councils which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Panadure, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton-Dickoya, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradapura, Badulla, Bandarawela, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Moratuwa, and Jaffna, and by Gansabhwas amounted in 1928 to Rs. 14,108,762-29. The revenue collected by the Sanitary Boards amounted to Rs. 989,800-74, a sum which includes a Government Grant of Rs. 5,250.

The municipal debt outstanding on 31st Dec., 1928, was Rs. 13,714,790-71. Of this amount Rs. 10,158,400-87 is the balance of the loan borrowed from the Government for the Colombo Drainage Works, and Rs. 2,752,215-75 for Water Works. Rs. 318,931-74 is the balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle for the construction of waterworks, sanitary improvements and electric lighting, and Rs. 485,233-35 is the balance due from the municipality of Kandy for water-works, drainage, housing and electric lighting.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1900, 149,264,602 lbs.; 1928, 237,000,000 lbs.

There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. On the failure of coffee, planters preferred to substitute cinchona and tea. Cinchona however did not survive low prices and was replaced by tea. Within recent years great attention has been given to rubber. In 1898, 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber, in 1906, 100,000 acres, and in 1928 about 634,000 acres under this cultivation.

The value of the products of the coconut palm exported in 1928 was Rs. 78,875,126. During the past few years greater attention has been given to the cultivation of coconuts, and large areas of land formerly occupied with cinnamon are now planted in this crop. The value of cacao exported in 1928 was Rs. 2,818,361 and of cinnamon Rs. 4,984,552.

The chief imports are rice from India (including Burma), valued at Rs. 91,529,181, and from other countries valued at Rs. 11,621,651 in 1928, and coal and textiles chiefly from the United Kingdom.

**Law and Justice.**

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. Kandyan law and Muslim law also prevail among Kandyans and Muslims respectively. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively has been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; by the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of minor criminal and civil suits; and by the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases. In addition to these there are the Gansabhwas, Village Councils, and Village Tribunals, instituted under the Ordinance No. 24 of 1889, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked well and are thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people. Besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, they have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

**Education.**

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1928 was 204,207, in schools aided by Government 296,790, and in unaided schools 26,694.

The total expenditure on account of the Education Department in 1927-28 was Rs. 10,478,128-48. In 1868, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure Rs. 161,660. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Education and the adoption of a system under which the educational wants of the Island are met partly by Government, partly by schools receiving grants in aid from Government. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; fees are charged for English teaching.

The only Secondary School entirely supported by Government is the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-aid Secondary Schools. Seven Government scholarships, each of 300L per annum, five for two years and two for three years, with outfit allowances of 50L each, and free passages, are awarded annually, on the results of the B.A. and B.Sc. Examinations of the University of London, to enable the best seven students of the year to complete their education at English universities.

Industrial education is provided in 129 Government and Grant-in-aid Schools and in a number of Orphanages. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893; its title has since been changed to "Government Technical Schools."

A University College opened in Colombo in 1921, offers instruction in the following subjects:—English Language and Literature, Classics and Philosophy, Modern History and Economics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Sanskrit and Pali, Tamil, Sinhalese, Modern Languages, Botany, Zoology, Geography. Students are presented for the External Examinations, Pass and Honours, of the University of London.

A Government Training College for Masters and Mistresses in English Schools and Government Vernacular Schools was opened in 1903.

**Medical Institutions.**

**Medical College.**—The Ceylon Medical College was founded in 1870 to provide a course of Medical training for the Ceylonese. The curriculum is a full five
years' course, and since 1897 the Licence of the College has been recognised by the General Medical Council as a registrable Colonial qualification. The courses of instruction and examinations are also recognised by many of the British Examining Boards. The licence has been conferred upon 473 candidates since the College was opened; of recent years about 18 qualify annually.

There is a Junior or Apothecary Department in which students go through a two years' course, and after passing the prescribed examinations are qualified to serve as Apothecaries and Estate Dispensers.

The College has a staff of over 30 lecturers and is managed by a Council incorporated by law.

There are at present over 175 students.

Owing to changes introduced by the Medical Council of Great Britain, the preliminary subjects, Physics, Chemistry and Biology, are now pre-medical subjects, and arrangements have been made for these to be studied at the University College. Students must pass an examination in these subjects before they can be admitted to the Medical College for their purely medical studies.

The Medical College fees amounted to rs. 43,621-50 in 1928-29.

There are 88 Government general hospitals, providing about 6,697 beds, with varying accommodation from 8 beds in smaller outstations to 858 beds in the General Hospital, Colombo.

There are in addition a number of special hospitals, viz., a lying-in-home with 100 beds, an eye hospital with 58 beds, a women's hospital with 45 beds, a children's hospital with 81 beds, a woman's venereal hospital with 29 beds, a police hospital with 31 beds, a tuberculosis hospital for chronic cases with 349 beds, a tuberculosis sanatorium with 72 beds, an infectious diseases hospital with 122 beds, a lunatic asylum and House of Observation with 1,728 beds, a prison hospital, Colombo, with 192 beds, and 8 other prison hospitals providing 155 beds, two leper asylums, one with 448 beds at Hendasala (near Colombo), and the other with 152 beds at Mantivu, Eastern Province.

Eighty-one estate hospitals and 684 estate dispensaries are maintained by proprietors of estates.

There were 575 Government dispensaries in different parts of the Island in 1928, and 3,482,691 patients who paid 5,169,488 visits were treated at these dispensaries.

There is a Bacteriological and also a Pasteur, and a Dental Institute.

The Department of Medical and Sanitary Services includes 311 grade medical officers, 122 of whom have only obtained licences in medicine and surgery granted by the Ceylon Medical College, 28 medical officers of health, 370 trained apothecaries, and 248 sanitary inspectors. There are three institutions where nurses are trained, and the nursing staff consists of 43 European qualified matrons and sisters, 124 European Roman Catholic mothers and sisters, 402 matrons and nurses trained locally, and pupils in training.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1927-28 to rs. 10,211,104-32. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 1,314,092-69 for 1927-28. The receipts, which included cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, etc., amounted to rs. 560,429-79 for 1927-28. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estates Branch of the Department yielded rs. 1,236,626-37 for 1927-28.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, sovereigns having ceased to be legal tender in the Colony in 1920. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pice. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 31st December, 1927, was rs. 62,470,602. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Imperial Bank of India; National Bank of India, Limited; Eastern Bank, Limited; P. & O. Banking Corporation, Ltd. None of these issues notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885. On 31st December, 1928, the deposits were: Ceylon Savings Bank, rs. 7,331,346; Post Office Savings Bank, rs. 12,895,498.

The Colombo Harbour.

A body designated the Colombo Port Commission was established in 1913, to administer the affairs of the Port of Colombo. The Commission is responsible for the efficient working of the Port, and has powers of executive action and initiative. It is composed of seven official members, seven unofficial members, and a secretary. The official members are the Principal Collector of Customs (Chairman), the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the General Manager of the Railway, the Chairman, Municipal Council, and Mayor of Colombo, the Deputy Collector of Customs, Colombo, the Master Attendant, Colombo and Galle, and the Harbour Engineer. Six of the unofficial members are nominated by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and the seventh (representative of the Ceylonese and Indian interests of the Port) by the Governor.

The Harbour Works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, commenced in 1873, and completed in 1885, at a cost of 705,207l., is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction North by East. It is built of concrete blocks weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.

The North-East and North-West breakwaters were begun in 1894, and completed in 1906, at a total cost of 531,657l. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging.

The North-West breakwater is an island work, 2,670 feet in length, running between the two shore breakwaters, leaving a western entrance of 750 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 643 acres, or one square mile.

An extension of the S.W. breakwater, starting from a point 3,150 feet from the shore end, was commenced in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1912. The arm is 1,800 feet long, and runs in a direction almost due north, protecting the present main entrance from the S.W. Monsoon seas. The cost of this additional arm was 338,931l.

The Graving Dock. A Graving Dock was commenced in 1899, and was completed in 1906. It is 723 feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost was 433,523l. There is also a guide pier, 800 feet long, to assist vessels entering the dock. The dock has its own electric light installation. Six new oil-fired boilers have recently been installed at the
Graving Dock, and all the boilers have been adapted for coal firing. The installation appears to be most satisfactory, and is now able to meet any likely demands for steam both for Dock and Oil Facilities services for some time to come. The docking of ships can be carried out by day or night.

The Patesi Slip was commenced in 1899, and opened in 1903, the cost being £426l. It is 800 feet long, the cradle being 220 feet, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

Oil Facilities. The Oil Installations Depot, which is about 92 acres in extent, lies 3½ miles inland from the harbour front. The Oil Companies' storage tanks are situated within this area, with pipe line connection from the harbour for fuel oil, kerosine, and benzine imported in bulk. There is also a Measuring Tanks Depot (about 19 acres in extent) at Bloemondahl, about three-quarters of a mile from the Harbour. Three reinforced concrete jetties, two for bunkering purposes and one for the discharge of oil tankers, have been provided. The Outer Bunkering Jetty can accommodate vessels of 550 feet in length with a draught of 27 feet after bunkering; the Inner Bunkering Jetty is only available for barges. The area in the vicinity of the Outer Bunkering Jetty is being dredged to accommodate vessels of 30 feet draught after bunkering. The Discharge Jetty can accommodate vessels 500 feet in length with a draught of 27 feet. The number of ships calling at Colombo for oil fuel bunkers has increased rapidly. The duplication of the 10-inch fuel oil pipe line from the Harbour to the Kolonnawa Oil Depot has been completed, and is working very satisfactorily. The two new steam-driven pumps, obtained to replace the fuel oil and the kerosine and petrol pumps at the Boosting Station at the Graving Dock, have been installed. The expenditure on the oil scheme up to 30th September, 1928, was rs. 5,162,306.

The Coal Depot consists of 24 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 17 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, steaming, and shipping of coal. The total cost of this depot was 64,764l.

The total cost of the Reclamation and Jetties amounts to 174,888l.

The Fishery Harbour has been constructed to the northward of Colombo harbour for the use of the fishermen as a beaching ground, the whole of the foreshore inside Colombo harbour being fully utilised. The fishery harbour consists of a rubble breakwater running out from the shore in a curve for 800 feet, the sheltered part forming a natural beaching ground for fishing canoes. The cost was 11,507l.

The total expenditure on the Colombo harbour from 1873, when work in connection with the first breakwater was commenced, to 1913, when the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the harbour, was rs. 44,790,267, or 2,986,018l., taking the value of the rupee at 1s. 4d.

In the period 1st July, 1913, to 30th September, 1928, a sum of rs. 32,233,471 or 2,148,892l., has been spent on various development and maintenance works by the Colombo Port Commission, and a sum of rs. 2,449,891 or 163,328l. by the Public Works Department, making a total of rs. 34,683,362 or 2,312,224l. In addition to the above expenditure a sum of rs. 660,052 or 44,004l. was charged to Loan Funds during the period 1st October, 1922, to 30th September, 1928, in connection with the dredging of the Colombo Harbour (including rock excavation). Prior to 1st October, 1922, this expenditure was met from Revenue, and is included in the sum of rs. 34,683,362 or 2,312,224l. mentioned above.

Since the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the Port, many improvements have been carried out, and shore facilities much increased. The warehouse accommodation in 1913 was 291,600 sq. ft., and this has been increased to 592,476 sq. ft., similarly quayage for lighters has been increased from 4,645 lineal ft. to 10,602 lineal ft.

Dredging for deepening the harbour has been steadily carried out, and, of the 643 acres low water area of the harbour, 186 acres are now dredged to 36 feet and over, 102 acres to between 36 and 33 feet, 147 acres to between 33 and 30 feet, and 208 acres to 30 feet and under; berthing accommodation exclusive of the Graving Dock Guide Pier and Oil Jetties being available for 36 vessels in the northeast monsoon and 23 or 40 using packed berths in the south-west monsoon, six of which berths are available in either monsoon for vessels of draughts up to 33 feet.

A scheme for the development of the Colombo Lake and its connection to the Harbour was completed in 1925 at a total cost of rs. 9,206,490, and the connection to the Harbour has already been taken over by the Colombo Port Commission and the areas on both sides developed for the landing of import cargoes; and the taking over of the remainder of the Lake Scheme will probably lead to further development of its resources.

Colombo Water Supply.

The Colombo Water supply is obtained from Labugama Reservoir which is situated in the Western Province, at a distance of 23½ miles from the City.

The Reservoir was formed by impounding the water of the Wak-Oya, a tributary of the Kelani Ganga.

The Catchment area, which is 2,500 acres in extent, is free from any habitation or cultivation, all the land to the summit of the water shed having been reserved together with a strip two chains in depth along the adjacent water sheds.

The area of the reservoir at present top water level is 205 acres. This lake, the scenery of which is very charming, is 370 feet above sea level and has a maximum depth of 70 feet.

The storage capacity of the reservoir is 1,900 million gallons.

Filtration works of the "Jewell Gravity" type are situated immediately below the Reservoir Dam.

The water has a very low alkalinity and is remarkably pure. It is conveyed to the two service Reservoirs in Colombo through three separate pipe lines; two of these are of cast iron each 20 inches in diameter, and the other of steel 30 inches in diameter.

There are some 250 miles of supply and distribution mains, varying in size from 30 to 3 inches in diameter. Water service is available to all premises within the City and also to shipping in Colombo Harbour.

The average daily consumption is estimated at 11 million gallons, and equals about 40 gallons per head of population.

Railways.

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:— Broad Gauge (5ft. 6in.), Colombo to Badulla (181½ miles), Polgahawela to Kankesanturai (212½ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21½ miles), Ragama Junction to Mahara Quarry (1¾ miles), Colombo to Matara (98¼ miles), Ragama to Puttalam (74½ miles), Maho to Batticaloa (182 miles), Galoya Junction to Trincomalee (43½ miles), Madawachi to Talaimannar Pier (66 miles), Kolonnawa Oil Line and Harbour Branch (3½ miles).
Narrow Gauge (2ft. 6in.), Colombo Fort to Yatiyantota (49½ miles), Avisawella to Opanaike (48½ miles), Nanu Oya to Ragalla (19¼ miles). Total Mileage 951 miles. The total cost of construction up to 30th September, 1928, charged in account was Rs. 211,052,467. The receipts for the 12 months ended 30th September, 1928, were Rs. 31,285,599, and expenditure Rs. 23,560,496.

By the completion of the Talaimannar extension the railway systems of India and Ceylon were brought within 20 miles of one another, the intervening distance being covered by steamers of the South Indian Railway Co., which ply between Dhansakodi (the Indian Port) and Talaimannar (the Ceylon Port). The other extensions are for the better transport of planting produce (tea, rubber, coconuts, etc.).

Roads.

Of metalled roads there are 3,713 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 372 and 128 miles respectively; of canals 164 miles. The maintenance of 4,213 miles of road cost, in 1928, Rs. 6,886,751 or an average rate of Rs. 1,635 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works.

Telephones.

The Government telephone system comprises two exchanges at Colombo, viz., Central Exchange (2,976 subscribers) and Havelock Town Exchange (313 subscribers), in trunk communication with exchanges at Kandy (216 subscribers), Nuwara Eliya (161 subscribers), Galle (123 subscribers), and smaller exchanges at Alawwa, Ambalangoda, Anuradhapura, Avissawella, Badulla, Balangoda, Balapitiya Bandaragama, Bandarawela, Bentota, Beruwela, Chilaw, Dandaganamuwa, Dehiowita, Demodara, Diyalatalawa, Dodanduwa, Etheliyagoda, Ella, Elpitiya, Galagedara, Gammaduwa, Gampola, Ginntota, Giriuila, Haliels, Haputale, Hatton, Horana, Ingiyira, Kadawata, Kadugannawa, Kahawatte, Kalutara, Katana, Katugastota, Katumayaka, Kegalla, Kelaniya Keebewa, Kirillia, Kochchikade, Kosgoda, Kotte, Kurunegala, Kuruwita, Madampe, Mahawela, Marawila, Matale, Matara, Mawanella, Mawatagama, Moratuwa, Mt.

There are, in addition, 80 licensed private systems of various sizes, several of which are connected by means of junction lines and subsidiary trunks with one another and the main trunk lines. The mileage of telephone wire in the Government system at the end of August, 1929, was estimated at 6,511 (aerial) and 28,630 (underground).

Telegraphs.

Nearly all parts of the island are served by the Government telegraph system, which has 285 offices working, inclusive of Railway offices open for postal telegrams. The system comprises 3,226 miles of line and 10,865 miles of wire. Ceylon is in direct telegraphic communication with India by a cable which starts from Talaimannar and crosses the Pamban Channel. It is also connected with Europe by direct cables from Colombo to Aden and with the Far East and Australia by direct cables to Penang.

There is a Government Radio Station in Colombo equipped for Continuous Wave and Interrupted Continuous Wave telegraphic services, and also for telephony.

The Continuous Wave service is conducted on a wave length of 2,300 metres with a normal daylight range of 1,000 miles.

The Interrupted Continuous Wave Service is conducted on the 600 metre wave length, and has a normal daylight range of 500 miles.

The telephonic equipment is for providing a broadcasting service on a wavelength of 800 metres. The rating of the set for telephony is 2 kilowatts. The number of licence holders at the end of August, 1929, was 1,359.
