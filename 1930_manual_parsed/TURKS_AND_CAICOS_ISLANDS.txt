TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is about 166 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 6½ miles long and 1½ miles broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,568 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population which in 1921 was 5,612. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

Grand Turk claims to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Two hurricanes passed over these Islands in 1926, on July 24th and September 16th respectively, and did great damage. The second one was the most disastrous, as regards damage to property, in the history of the Dependency.

Another hurricane passed over these Islands on September 14th, 1928, which did considerable damage and caused the loss of 17 lives.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons. 1,401,218 bushels were exported in 1928 valued at 25,283l. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1928, 21,556 lbs., was valued at 2,193l. 1,523,275 dried conchs (shell fish), valued at 1,523l. Cotton and Cotton Seed valued at 1,183l., were shipped in 1928.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1928, 45 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 953 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.
Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1928 amounted to 28.35 inches, the average rainfall during the five years 1924-1928 was 26.66 inches.

Means of Communication.

There is a mail, passenger, and freight service between New York and Grand Turk every three weeks by steamers of the Porto Rico Line.

Steamers of the Royal Netherlands West India Mail, trading between New York and South America, call at Grand Turk about twice a month for stevedores and call again on the return voyage to land them. These ships bring mails and passengers from New York but no cargo.

The Elders and Fyffes Line make occasional calls on their way to Jamaica when passengers offer and on such occasions take mails to Jamaica.

There is a telephone exchange at Grand Turk with 60 connections.

The rate of letter postage is 2d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3d. per ounce.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1898, the station being at Grand Turk. The rates are per word: To England 2s. 4½d., to Jamaica 1s., to Halifax 1s. 6½d.

A new cable was laid in 1924 connecting Grand Turk with Barbados.

Communication between Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the Turks Islands and Cockburn Harbour has been established by wireless telephone. The station at Grand Turk is also a telegraphic one with a sending range of about 500 miles.

Education.

In 1921 a secondary school was opened at Grand Turk and controlled by a Board of Management appointed by the Commissioner. This school receives an annual government grant of £500, and other revenue is derived from school fees.

There are ten elementary schools supported by Government, with 854 pupils enrolled in 1927 and an average attendance of 622. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

During 1924 a Centre for the Cambridge Local Examinations was established at Grand Turk.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahamas Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of five shillings, ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1928, 922 depositors, with 19,047l. deposits.

Constitution.

By Jamaica Law No. 6 of 1926 which came into operation on the 1st day of August, 1926, the Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner, who by virtue of his office is President, and seven other persons, three of whom are holders of offices under the Crown, appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.
