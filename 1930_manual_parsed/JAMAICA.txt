*JAMAICA.*

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 42' 20" and 18° 32' 30", and W. long. 76° 11' 56" and 78° 23' 35". It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,450 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,388 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the south-west, and the Rio Grande in the north-east. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 62,707 in 1921, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 16' and 19° 46' N. lat., and 75° 83' and 81° 30' W. long, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, are dependencies of Jamaica,† as are also Pedro and Morant Cays (two guano islands in 17° N. lat.).

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,848,160 acres, from which may be deducted 80,000 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,768,160 acres available for cultivation. Of this 1,157,586 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1927-28.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica ("Xaymaca—well watered"). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, the Governor of Hispaniola. It was raided by Sir Anthony Shirley.

in 1596-7, and by Colonel Jackson in 1643, but it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II., who appointed General Edward Doyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. Part of this town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston which then consisted of a few sheds, soon rose into a place of importance. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountainmen, the descendants of African slaves. These consisted primarily of the slaves the Spaniards left, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains, but before long runaway slaves from English masters took refuge in the mountains of the centre of the island and were only subjugated in 1738, when both classes of maroons were settled in five reserves under their own leaders, and henceforth gave little trouble except for a partial rising in 1795, which was soon suppressed, the prisoners taken being sent to Sierra Leone. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A rebellion among the coloured population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1907, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of 150,000l. was voted by Parliament, and a loan of 800,000l., chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°7', rising to 87°6' in the daytime, and falling to 71°0' in the early morning. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° lower in temperature can be attained by a ride of one hour by motor car.

The rainy seasons occur generally over the whole island in May and June and again in September, October and November; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by occasional showers; and in the N.E. portion of the island there is usually a rainy season at the end of the year, and light rains generally during the month of August. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches to as much as 187 inches at Fellowship and 222 inches at Moore Town, both on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain Range. And the 50-year average is 76 inches.

Regions of the Island are visited by storms of hurricane force about 14 times in a century and disastrous earthquakes occurred in 1692 and 1907.

Under two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, somewhat over three-fourths being pure negroes. There are about 18,000 East Indians and about 3,700 Chinese (in 1921). English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a nominated Council, and an elected Assembly which on its first meeting in 1664, consisted of 30 members but which fluctuated in numbers from time to time. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored. A separate Privy Council was set up and an Executive Committee was established. The latter was to act as a sort of Cabinet, especially as regards financial matters.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature responded by abrogating all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

Accordingly a Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1896, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex-officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons as may be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the
approval of His Majesty, but the number of members is not to exceed eight. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

A special feature of this constitution is that nine elected members can carry any financial measure, while the unanimous vote of the whole fourteen elected members on other matters cannot be overridden by the other votes unless the governor declares that such a decision is of paramount importance in the public interest.

Administration.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties, an excise duty on rum, and stamp and licence duties. A tax of 1s. (in Kingston 3d.) on every £10 of the gross value of property is levied.

There is a Supreme Court of Judicature together with Resident Magistrate Courts and Petty Sessions of Justices of the Peace throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of Petty Sessions.

An "Island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the Parochial Boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision.

There is a Corporation of the amalgamated parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew with a Mayor, Council and Corporate officers.

In the 13 other parishes there are elective Parochial Boards under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, water-works, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population, in 1921, 62,707), Port Royal (population 1,004), Spanish Town (population 8,694), Port Antonio (population 6,272), Montego Bay (population 6,580), Falmouth (population 2,136), Port Maria (population 2,481), and Savanna la Mar (population 3,442).

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1928-29 was 410,454l.; their expenditure 407,297l. Their debt at the end of the year was 905,065l.

Currency and Banking.

British currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000l. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada and the Canadian Bank of Commerce are the only private banking establishments in the Colony. Barclays Bank has one branch and 9 sub-branches; it had an average weekly note circulation in 1928 of 128,812l. The Bank of Nova Scotia has 11 branches and 1 sub-branch, and had an average note circulation in 1928 of 69,404l. The Royal Bank of Canada has two branches and had an average note circulation in 1928 of 17,067l. The Canadian Bank of Commerce has a branch in Kingston, and had an average note circulation in 1928 of 5,778l. Approximately 200,000l. of British currency notes formerly in circulation are being withdrawn and replaced by Bank of England Notes, in denominations of 10s. and £1. British silver coins of and above the denomination of 6d. are legal tender to any extent; coins below the denomination of 6d. are legal tender to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Under Law 27 of 1904, local Currency Notes, which are made legal tender under section 5, have been issued to the extent of 212,500l. in denominations of 2s. 6d., 5s. and 10s.; 2s. 6d. notes, 31,250l.; 5s. notes, 106,250l.; 10s. notes, 75,000l. Estimated amount of local currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1929, was 81,044l. The 2s. 6d. notes have been recalled and nearly all are withdrawn from circulation.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent., and in 1897 to 2½ per cent. In 1917 the rate of interest was again increased to 3 per cent. There are 93 branches now operating. The total deposits on 31st December, 1928, was 571,848l.

Co-Operative Loan Banks.

There are now 53 Loan Banks on the Register of Industrial and Provident Societies. Of these, 36 have obtained loans from the Agricultural Loan Societies Board appointed under Law 6 of 1912, "A Law for the encouragement of Agricultural Loan Societies."

The following is a summary of these transactions to 31st December, 1928:

| Loans made under Law 6 of 1912 | 45,516l. |
|-------------------------------|-----------|
| "                              | 9s. 0d.   |
| "                              | Hurricane or Special Loan Laws | 80,489l. |
| "                              | 12s. 4d.  |

Total: 126,006l. 1s. 4d.

Of this amount, 110,657l. 5s. 11d. has been repaid, leaving 15,348l. 15s. 8d. outstanding.

The 44 Banks from which returns were obtained also collected to 31st December, 1925, the sum of over 35,239l. share capital. These figures may be taken as an indication that the work of the Loan Banks has been successfully carried on and that they are likely to prove a permanent benefit to Small Holders and Peasant Proprietors. Some of these Banks have extended their sphere of usefulness by taking advantage of the Land Settlement Scheme, whereby Government moneys are lent for the purchase of properties for the purpose of re-sale in lots to small settlers. 56,641l. 3s. 11d. has been loaned to nine Banks, under this head, and 34,059l. 19s. 8d. repaid. The scheme has been well received, and its extension in the future seems certain.

Education.

Elementary education is provided for from public funds and, during recent years, 129 Government (undenominational) elementary schools have been established. The number of schools is 668.
with 76,990 scholars in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1927 was £124,861; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges for women teachers. By a law passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. The District School Boards manage the Government schools, some of which are held in Government buildings, others in rented buildings.

Provision was made in 1892 for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are eighteen secondary schools receiving aid from public funds under regulations for grants in aid. Secondary education is provided for in general by endowed schools, under local governing bodies controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. A beginning has been made in providing from public funds for technical education. There are three scholarships (one for girls) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica. The following examinations are held:—London University, Cambridge Locals, Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society.

In the Institute of Jamaica (in Kingston) is a Public Library with 27,000 books, of which 7,000 form a West India Reference Library; a Natural History Museum, with a small collection of live animals; and a Jamaica History Gallery.

Industry.

Fruit is the largest export, 17,080,897 stems of bananas of a value of £1,773,666 being exported in 1928, in which year citrus fruits (grape fruits and oranges) valued at £79,539 were also exported. Other exports were as under:

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica via the United States. Messrs. Elder's and Fyffe's steamers sail frequently from Liverpool. The voyage takes 13 to 14 days. The Leyland Line steamers (West India and Pacific Branch) leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. The two cables from Cuba touch at Jamaica, from which they branch away via St. Thomas to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

Telegraph lines connect all the principal towns, and there are 155 telegraph and telephone stations. The total mileage open is 1,639, 1,026 miles along roads, 172 miles P.O. lines on railway, and 210 along railway lines. The receipts in 1928 were 18,880l.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of St. James, a distance of 112 miles 60 chains, and to Port Antonio, in the parish of Portland, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 63 miles; and to Ewarton, by a branch line from Bog Walk, on the Port Antonio branch, of 8 miles 40 chains, and by a branch line from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; also from Linstead to New Works, 2 miles 40 chains. The total length of line open is 210 miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed the Government resumed

possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge for 1928-29, providing for interest and repayment, is £186,440L. The receipts in 1928-29 were more than the expenditure by £36,178L, leaving a deficiency of £150,262L. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 1124 miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 174 miles; from Bog Walk to Port Antonio, 544 miles; from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; and from Linstead to New Works, 24 miles.

The island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metalled roads, suitable for motoring, the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum grades are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,289 miles of main roads, and about 4,366 miles of parochial roads.

A coastal service is run by the United Fruit Co., the Royal Mail Co. and the Webster Co. with motor vessels and sailing vessels whenever cargo is available.

The United Fruit Co., the Royal Mail Co., Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Co., Atlantic Fruit Co. and Leyland Line maintain a weekly steamship service and also call at outports when necessary.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st December, 1928, no ships were built.
