NORTHERN RHODESIA.†

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 287,350 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine Provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, Fort

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambezi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa, and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbeck doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November his advanced parties opened fire on the British South Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chambezi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities. The number of individual Rhodesians (men and women) known to have undertaken duties in connection with the war was 7,009. Of these 6,859 served with H.M. Forces during the war, 459 being from Northern Rhodesia. 791 were killed in action or died of wounds or disease.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 26th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. R. A. J. Goode as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika District of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 26th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and the Principal Medical Officer. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and seven unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia. He was succeeded in 1927 by Sir James Crawford Maxwell, K.B.E., C.M.G., M.D.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse District is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.
The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied. The Civil jurisdiction of District Commissioners' Courts is limited to causes or matters concerning natives. They also have criminal jurisdiction over natives with limitations. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from District Commissioners' Courts to Provincial Commissioners' Courts, and from Provincial Commissioners' Courts to the High Court.

### Population

| Censuses | European | Native |
|----------|----------|--------|
|          | Male     | Female | Total | Male | Female | Total |
| 1911     | 1,121    | 376    | 1,497 | —    | —      | 821,102 |
| 1921     | 2,263    | 1,371  | 3,634 | 447,841 | 532,064 | 979,905 |

The European population at the 31st December, 1928, was computed as 7,536. The native population was estimated to be 1,261,972.

### Education

**European.**—For the education of European children there were in 1928 Government Schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill, and Fort Jameson. At all of these, with the exception of the school at Fort Jameson, primary education up to Standard VII was given, with the additional subjects, Latin, French, Algebra in Standards VI and VII, and Geometry in Standard VII. At Fort Jameson primary education was given up to Standard V. Seven "B" Schools were open during the year at Silver Rest, Chilongo, Lubombo, Bwana M'Bubwa, Luanshya, N'dola, and N'kana, in all of which education was given up to Standard V.

The Beit School at Choma provided a separate boarding school for girls, while the Codrington School, Mazabuka, accommodated boys only as boarders.

**Native.**—A Director of Native Education has been appointed, and a system of Government Grants-in-aid to Missionary Societies who agree to conform to the general educational policy of the Government has been instituted. An Advisory Board in Native Education has been set up, upon which missionaries, settlers, and Government Departments are represented. A Government School for the training of Jeanes Visiting Teachers and Agricultural Demonstrators is in course of erection at Mazabuka, connected with the Central Agricultural Research Station. The Barotse National School is also a Government Institution.

### Climate

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° to 90° with a maximum of 103° and a minimum of 56°. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 55° to 75° with a maximum of 86° and a minimum of 40°. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of 120°, whilst minima round about 30° are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period July to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations show is 37.5 inches per annum.

### Commerce and Industry

#### Agriculture

Farming and ranching occupy a considerable portion of the European inhabitants.

Maize is the chief crop, and the demand for this is steadily increasing, and the prices obtained have been most satisfactory.

The cultivation of cotton received a severe check some years ago by reason of the damage caused by insect pests and fungoid diseases. Experiments are being actively carried out with a view to obtaining a new, or improved, variety which will be suitable to local conditions. The results obtained up to date are such that a considerable feeling of optimism obtains as to the future of cotton growing in the Territory.

The glut in the tobacco market, caused by overproduction of Empire leaf, has caused no small amount of embarrassment to planters. When market conditions have again become stabilised there would appear to be no reason why tobacco should not once more take its place as one of the most valuable and important crops. The amount of wheat produced is still far below local requirements. The establishment of a Co-operative Wheat Mill in the wheat area has made it possible for the crop to be converted into flour after a minimum amount of transport. The mill can deal with far greater quantities than it receives at present. Formerly, all wheat grown had to be exported to Southern Rhodesia for milling. Other crops are, groundnuts, beans, potatoes, and, to a smaller extent, citrus.

The requirements of the Territory are still greater than the supply of the majority of the crops grown, and an increase in the acreage of these and other crops for human consumption is obviously indicated. The increased population, resulting from the activities in connection with mining development, has caused a very much increased demand for foodstuffs of all varieties.

The dairy industry is small but is making steady progress. There is scope for greater increase in the production of dairy produce, as the Territory produces under a quarter of the requirements of the local demand and of those of the Belgian Congo. The balance is imported from the south.

The ranching industry is of considerable importance but it is quite incapable of supplying the demands made upon it. As a consequence, many thousands of cattle pass through Northern Rhodesia from Southern Rhodesia and N'Gamiland each year to supply the markets of the Belgian Congo. The estimated requirements of Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo for slaughter cattle are 43,000 head per annum.
A Central Veterinary and Agricultural Research Station has been completed, and plant breeding, seed selection and demonstration work with crops commenced. A number of cattle have been obtained and these will form the foundation of a herd of pedigree cattle. The laboratory for veterinary and agricultural research is almost complete. The station will be of value to intending settlers who may wish to obtain further experience before commencing farming in the Territory, and will be used in training native demonstrators. In the vicinity of the station a school is being erected for training native industrial and agricultural artisans and demonstrators.

Land Settlement.

A Land Settlement Advisory Board has been appointed for the purpose of collecting the information which is necessary before land can be disposed of. Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Dept. of Mines.

The outstanding features of the year 1928 from a mining standpoint were:

(a) The zinc metal from Broken Hill Mine and zinc concentrates from Star 2 Mine.

(b) The further development of the copper sulphide sediments of the Nkana Grant Area whereby certain located copper deposits, the Roan Antelope and the Nkana Mines, were further proved beyond doubt to be of great value. Preparations for large scale working are in full swing.

(c) The discovery of remarkable width, strike and copper contents of the sediments at Amphilca in the same area.

(d) The copper discoveries in the neighbourhood of the Nchanga Mine.

Water power is in growing demand, roads in the mine areas have undergone marked improvement. The number of natives employed have greatly increased and their working conditions have been improved. During 1928 13,176 tons of zinc, 4,676 tons of lead, 5,930 tons of copper, 113,656 lbs. of vanadium, 7,930 lbs. of mica, 602 ounces of gold and 87 ounces of silver were produced.

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambezi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Legislation was passed in December, 1927, for the construction of a branch line from Bwana M'Kubwa, on the main line, to the N'Kana Mine, a distance of approximately 45 miles. The line has been surveyed and negotiations are taking place regarding construction.

Legislation was also passed in May, 1928, for the construction of a branch line from Ndola on the main line to the Roan Antelope Mine, a distance of approximately 22 miles. The construction of this line is well in hand.

Road communications are being opened up, and dry season motor tracks are now in use from Victoria Falls (via Livingstone, Lusaka and Broken Hill) to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge (790 miles approx.); Broken Hill to Abercorn (604 miles), and thence via Old Fife, on the border of Northern Rhodesia, to Tanganika and Kenya Colony; this portion forming part of the Cape to Cairo Route. Lusaka and Fort Jameson are also connected by road, a distance of 375 miles.

The Zambezi, Kafue, Leopold, and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aerodromes are situated at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Ndola, and Abercorn.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyasaland. There are 38 post offices in the Territory, 12 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the Territory is 2,406 miles.

Finance.

| Year     | Revenue | Expenditure |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1924-1925 | 309,795 | 340,327     |

(b) 50,000l. refund to the Imperial Treasury on account of Loan Grants in Aid.

An income tax was first imposed in Northern Rhodesia in 1921. The rates of tax now in force are:

For each pound of the first 100l. of the chargeable amount 6d.

next 100l. 1s. 6d.

100l. 2s. 6d.

in excess of 500l. 3s. 6d.
