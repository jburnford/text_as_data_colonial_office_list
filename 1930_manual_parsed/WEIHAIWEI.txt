WEIHAIWEI.

History and Description.

The territory of Weihaiwei was leased to Great Britain by China by a Convention signed at Peking, on the 1st July, 1898,—"in order to provide Great Britain with a suitable Naval harbour in North China and for the better protection of British commerce in the neighbouring seas."

The leased territory, which lies in latitude 37°30' N., longitude 122°10' E., is situated in the Chinese Province of Shantung, on the North-Eastern coast of the Shantung Peninsula. It comprises the Island of Liukung, all the islands in the Bay of Weihaiwei, and a belt of land ten English miles wide along the entire coast line.

The bay is six miles broad and from three to four wide. To it there is easy access from the Eastern and Western passages, the former being two-and-a-quarter miles wide, the latter two-thirds of a mile wide. These two channels are formed by the Island of Liukung, which, lying east and west across the Bay and being two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, forms a protection to the anchorage.

Weihaiwei is an easy place for shipping to make, and battleships and ocean steamers are able to lie close to the shore. The harbour is lighted by two lighthouses.

The territory has been surveyed by the Royal Engineers and mapped on a scale of two inches to a mile. The total area is 285 square miles, including the Island of Liukung.

Great Britain has also "the right to erect fortifications, station troops, or take any other measures necessary for defensive purposes at any points on or near the coast of the region East of the Meridian 121°40' East of Greenwich, and to acquire on equitable compensation within that territory such sites as may be necessary for water supply, communications, and hospitals. Within that zone Chinese administration will not be interfered with, but no troops other than Chinese or British shall be allowed therein." This zone has been surveyed on a scale of one inch to a mile, and its area has been fixed at 1,505 square miles. The territory has a picturesque and diversified coast line seventy-two miles in length. Its surface consists of abrupt ranges of rugged hills, rising to a height of 1,600 feet, and well-cultivated valleys, watered by streams which during the dry season are mere rivulets. All the hills are terraced for cultivation, so far as possible, and in many instances are planted with dwarf pine and scrub oak, but their general appearance is barren; the strata of the mountains are metamorphic, consisting of beds of quartzite, gneiss and crystalline limestone cut across by dykes of volcanic rock and granite.

There are over 350 villages, and the Chinese population (according to the census of 1921) is 154,416. Since 1921 it has increased considerably partly owing to the growth of prosperity of the port, and also to the influx of some of the inhabitants of the neighbouring Chinese districts who have suffered greatly from disturbed political conditions and banditry. The population in 1929 was estimated to be 178,000.

The chief port of the territory is named Port Edward, in commemoration of the coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII.

Negotiations for the rendition of the territory to China, in accordance with the decisions taken at the Conference of Washington were practically concluded in 1924, but owing to the absence of a settled government in China it has not yet been found possible to give effect to the draft Convention under which rendition was to be effected. Negotiations have however now been resumed and preliminary agreement reached on revised terms of rendition.

Climate.

The climate is regarded as one of the best in China. The winter is cold and bracing, and the summer heat is not excessive. The average maximum temperature in the shade is about 96° F., and the minimum about 10°. The maximum temperature during the summer of 1929 was 102° on June 2nd. The rainfall is very small, averaging about 24 inches a year. The wettest months are July and August.

Constitution and Government.

The Government is administered by a Commissioner, appointed under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, who discharges his functions under the Weihaiwei Order in Council of the 24th July, 1901. Under that instrument the Commissioner is empowered to make Ordinances, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the administration of the territory, and provision is made for a High Court, in which all jurisdiction, civil and criminal, is vested, subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, and for District Magistrates' Courts.

The village communities are administered through their headmen in accordance with Chinese custom.

During the summer months Weihaiwei is used by His Majesty's fleet on the China Station as a sanatorium and exercising ground, and is frequented by visitors who are attracted by its climate. During the summer of 1927 a convalescent camp was established for officers and men of the Shanghai Defence Force. During 1929 the permanent garrison consisted of a company of the Royal Scots.

The territory previous to 1922-23 was assisted by a grant-in-aid from Imperial funds, but since that time has been entirely self-supporting.

The revenue for 1929-30 was estimated at $355,215, and the expenditure at $343,365.

In previous years the statistics were:

| Year   | Revenue | Expenditure |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1924-25 | 204,050 | 181,793     |
| 1925-26 | 223,914 | 190,147     |
| 1926-27 | 258,235 | 216,173     |
| 1927-28 | 275,946 | 247,013     |
| 1928-29 | 324,636 | 313,228     |

The administration of Weihaiwei was first undertaken by the Senior Naval Officer on the station in 1898. In the following year it was transferred to a Military and Civil Commissioner appointed by the War Office. On the 1st January, 1901, the territory was handed over to the control of the Colonial Office, and a Civil Commissioner assumed the administration of the Government in 1902.
