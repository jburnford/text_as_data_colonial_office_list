THE GOLD COAST COLONY.

Situation and Native Tribes.

The Gold Coast Colony, with Ashanti, the Protected Northern Territories, and the British mandated territory of Togoland, is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, between 3° 7' W. long. and 1° 14' E. long., and is bounded on the west by the French colony of the Ivory Coast, on the east by the French mandated territory of Togoland, on the north by the French Colony of the Upper Volta, and on the south by the sea.

The area of the Colony is 23,490 square miles, of Ashanti, 24,560, of the Northern Territories, 30,600, and of the British mandated territory of Togoland, 13,040.

The Colony is inhabited by a large number of tribes, whose customs and forms of government are of a more or less similar character. Each tribe has its own head chief and every town or village of the tribe a chief or headman.

The head chiefs and chiefs form the council of the tribe, and assist in dealing with matters affecting its general welfare. The succession to the chiefs' stools is for the most part in the female line, the heir to the stool being selected from among the sons of the occupant's sisters, his brothers and the male off-spring of his aunts on the father's side.

The principal sea coast tribes are the following:—Apollonia, Ahanta, Shama, Komenda, Elmina, Cape Coast or Fanti, Winneba, Assin Gomoa, Ga, Adangme, Awuna, Agbosome and Afiao.

In the interior of the Colony the principal tribes are:—Aowin, upper and lower Wasaw, Setwi, upper and lower Denkera, Tufel, Assen, Eskuma, Ajumako, Akim Abuakwa, and Akim Kotoku, Akwapim, eastern and western Krobo, Akwamu, Krepi, Shai and Ningo.

A number of different languages and dialects are spoken, the principal being, Twi, Fanti, Ewe and Ga; but the use of English is widespread.
For the purposes of administration the Colony is divided into three provinces, each presided over by a Provincial Commissioner. These Provinces are further divided into districts, presided over by District Commissioners. Most of these Officers perform judicial duties as magistrates in addition to being in administrative charge of their districts. The districts are as follows:

1. Western province:—Districts—Axim, Ankobra, Tarkwa, Sekondi-Dixcove, Sefwi and Aowin.

2. Central province:—Districts—Cape Coast, Saltpond, Winneba, Western Akim.

3. Eastern province:—Districts—Acora, New Juaben, Akwapim, Volta River, Keta-Ada, Akim-Abuakwa, Kwahu, Ho (Togoland).

History.

It is said that as early as the reign of Edward I. (1272-1307) English navigators made voyages to the Gold Coast, and that a hundred years later French adventurers reached the coast, who, about 1364, built several lodges or forts, one being at Elmina, parts of which are supposed to have been subsequently incorporated in the present castle there. No definite evidence however exists to support these claims, although it is quite possible they are both correct; indeed, the natives until quite recently used to point out a hill near Takoradi as the site of a French fort built there many years ago. For our earliest knowledge of the Gold Coast we are indebted to the Portuguese navigators of the later years of the 14th and first part of the 15th centuries. They had been slowly extending their voyages down the West Coast of Africa, and it is recorded that in 1471 Juan de Santerem and Pedro d'Escolao traded for gold in the neighbourhood of Elmina or Chama. They made the first European settlement eleven years later, when an expedition under Diego d'Azumbuja built and garrisoned the fort San Jorge da Mina (Elmina), the materials for which he brought with him from Portugal. Several other settlements were founded, and the country was claimed for the King of Portugal by virtue of a Papal Bull granted in 1430, which gave to Portugal all the islands already discovered and all future discoveries in Guinea. This Bull was confirmed a few years after the foundation of Elmina by Pope Sextus IV. The Portuguese remained in undisputed possession for over fifty years until British merchant adventurers commenced trading on the coast, the earliest voyages of which records remain being those of Thomas Windham and Antonio Anes Pintedo, in 1583, John Lok, in 1554, and William Towson, in 1555, 1556 and 1558. The British made no settlements at this time and their trade soon lapsed altogether until the early years of the 17th century. The Dutch, however, who made their first appearance on the coast in 1596, rapidly became serious rivals of the Portuguese and practically terminated their occupation by capturing Elmina in 1637, and Fort St. Anthony at Axim in 1642. After the activities of the Elizabethan sailors and merchant companies had come to an end, the English connection with the Gold Coast was revived by the efforts of a series of merchant companies, the first of which, called the "Company of Adventurers of London trading into Africa" was founded in 1618, but did not enjoy a successful career. Another company was formed in 1631, which established the first British fort on the coast at Kormantin, and lodges at several other places. This company was engaged in the slave trade, as were also the other European nations. Its charter was renewed in 1651, but in 1662 a new company was incorporated as the "Company of Royal Adventurers of England trading to Africa." Settlements were formed at Anomabu, Accra, and at Cabo Corso (Cape Coast), at which place the castle was built about this time by the English, although the Portuguese probably had a lodge there earlier. Three other European nations succeeded in acquiring territories on the Gold Coast, viz.:—The Swedes, the Brandenburghers, and the Danes. The first-mentioned built the fort of Christiansborg, near Accra about 1645, but were driven out by the Danes in 1657, and retired from the Coast. The Brandenburghers established "Fort Great Fredericksburg" at Princes River in 1683, and "Fort Dorothea" at Akwida in 1685, but their enterprise does not seem to have been prosecuted with much vigour, and was finally abandoned in 1720, their possessions falling into the hands of the Dutch. The Danes, however, after first selling the Fort at Christiansborg to the Portuguese, and re-buying it three years later, rapidly improved their position, building forts at several stations to the East of Accra, as far as Ada and Keta, and exercising a kind of Protectorate over Akwapim, and the Volta River district.

The third English Company was not successful. The Dutch traders spared no efforts to get rid of their rivals, and in consequence of their aggression, an expedition was sent by Charles II. in 1664, under the command of Captain Holmes, which recaptured Cape Coast, taken the previous year by the Dutch, and all the other Dutch forts, with the exception of Elmina and possibly Axim. In the following year, however, the Dutch Commander de Ruyter recaptured all the lost Dutch forts, with the exception of Cape Coast; and the treaty of Breda, 1667, left affairs in the Gold Coast in this condition. The fourth English Company was incorporated in the year 1672 under the name of the "Royal African Company of England." Under its influence English interests steadily advanced, and forts were established at Dixcove, Sekondi, Komenda, Anomabu, Tamkumweri, Winneba, Acora. The abolition of the exclusive privileges which the Royal African Company enjoyed, led to its decline and eventual dissolution in 1752. By the Acts of Parliament 23 George II., c. 31, and 25 George II., c. 40, a fifth trading Corporation, called the "African Company of Merchants" was formed, the membership of which was open to all British traders on payment of a fee of 40/-, compensation being paid for its charter and property to the Royal African Company. An annual subsidy was granted by Parliament to the newly-formed Company, until 1821, when by the Act 1 & 2 George IV., c. 28, the Company was dissolved and its possessions vested in the Crown, and placed under the Government of the West African Settlement, the seat of government being at Sierra Leone.

In 1824, the Governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Charles Macarthy, on visiting Cape Coast Castle, found the neighbouring country of the Fantis in possession of the Ashantis. He formed the resolution of inciting the Fantis against their oppressors, and led an army of them, with a few disciplined soldiers, against the Ashantis at Insamankow, where, on the 24th of January, 1824, he was killed, and his force totally routed.

The war which ensued was ended by the victory of the English at Dodowa, near Accra, in 1826. Peace was formally concluded by a tripartite Treaty in 1831, between the English, the Fantis, and the Ashantis.
In the meantime, Her Majesty's Government had inclined to the policy of retiring from the coast altogether, and after the peace they actually transferred the government of the forts to the local and London merchants interested, who secured as their Governor Mr. George Maclean, a man of marked energy and capacity. This gentleman, with a force of no more than 100 men at command, and with a Government subsidy of only £4,000 a year, contrived to extend and maintain the influence of his Government over the whole tract of country now known as the Gold Coast. In 1843, it having been suspected that the Merchant Government connived at the slave trade, the forts were resumed by the Crown, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed. Mr. Maclean was continued in the direction of native affairs, under the title of Judicial Assessor to the Native Chiefs, which post he held until his death in 1847.

Hitherto the forts of the various nations were intermixed with each other, and there was no defined limit as to where the influence of one or the other began or ended. The imposition of Customs duties was rendered difficult, if not impossible, by the existence of the free ports of a rival nation within a stone's throw, as it were, of the duty ports. On the 24th of January, 1860, by Letters Patent, the Settlements on the Gold Coast ceased to be dependencies of Sierra Leone, and in the same year, by the purchase of the forts and protectorate of the Danes, the Coast line from Christiansborg to Keta and the districts of Shai, eastern and western Krobo, Akwapim, Akwamu, and Krepi, were acquired by England. By a Commission dated the 19th February, 1866, the Gold Coast Settlements were reunited to the Colony of Sierra Leone under one Governor-in-Chief. In 1867, a convention was made with the Dutch by which the portion of the Coast lying to the west of the Sweet River, which flows into the sea between Cape Coast and Elmina, was allotted to Holland, England taking all the territory to the east of the river, and a customs union between the two nations was established. The Dutch, however, found many difficulties in the way of their occupation of the forts and possessions received from the English in exchange for those of their own lying to the East of the boundary line. The native tribes refused to recognise their authority, and the prospect before them was that of a long series of petty wars with no reasonable hope of profit to be gained in the future. The result was the convention made between England and Holland in 1871, by which the Dutch transferred all their forts and possessions on the Coast to the English, and Great Britain obtained at last the sole sovereignty and control of the territory from Half-Assinie to Adafo. The forts were transferred on the 6th of April, 1872. The present extent and limits of the colony are defined in the Order in Council of 1906.

**Constitution.**

At the conclusion of peace in 1874, measures were taken for placing the government of the Gold Coast upon a footing of efficiency and security.

A new charter was issued, dated the 24th of July, 1874, separating the settlements of the Gold Coast and Lagos from the government of the West Africa Settlements, and erecting them into one colony under the style of the Gold Coast Colony, under a Governor-in-Chief, with an Administrator at Lagos. There was one Executive Council and one nominated Legislative Council for the two settlements, and one Supreme Court. The charter of 1874 was superseded by Letters Patent dated the 23rd of January, 1883, and 13th January, 1886, respectively. By the latter instrument Lagos was separated from the Gold Coast and formed into a distinct colony. Provision was made for an Executive and Legislative Council, the members of both being nominated by the Crown. Four unofficial members were appointed to the Legislative Council.

By Royal Instructions dated 20th September, 1916, under Letters Patent of the same date, all previous Instructions were revoked and the Executive and Legislative Councils were re-constituted. The Executive Council was constituted by the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Treasurer, the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, with the Governor as President. The Legislative Council was constituted by the members of the Executive Council and, in addition, the Comptroller of Customs, the Director of Public Works, the General Manager of Railways, and the Commissioners of the Eastern, Central and Western Provinces, as ex officio members, and such unofficial members as might be appointed by the Crown. By an Order in Council dated 8th April, 1925, Letters Patent and Royal Instructions dated 23rd May, 1925, the Legislative Council was reconstituted. It is now composed of the Governor, fifteen Official Members and fourteen Unofficial Members. The newly-constituted Legislative Council for the first time contains an elective element; provision having been made for the election of six Head Chiefs as Provincial Members of the Council, three Municipal Members to represent the towns of Accra, Cape Coast, and Sekondi, respectively, a Mercantile Member, and a Mining Member.

**Municipal Government.**

The Municipal Corporations Ordinance passed in 1924 provides for elected municipal councils and abolishes the official majority which was a feature of former municipal councils. This law comes into operation when applied to a particular municipality by Order-in-Council.

**Law and Justice.**

The Law of the Colony is the Common law, the doctrines of equity, and the statutes of general application in force in England, on the 24th July, 1874, modified by a large number of Local Ordinances passed since that date. The Criminal Law was codified in 1892, and the civil and criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court and Criminal Procedure Ordinances both originally passed in 1876.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which is presided over by the Chief Justice and five Puisne Judges. Divisional Courts of the Supreme Court are held in different parts of the colony. There are also a large number of inferior Courts with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction, some of which are presided over by Police Magistrates and the remainder by Commissioners. The Supreme Court has an original civil and criminal jurisdiction, and also decides appeals from the inferior courts. The Chief Justice, and the Judges in their respective provinces have also powers of revision of the decisions of the Magistrates and Commissioners in criminal cases. Appeals from Divisional Courts are heard by a full court of the Supreme Court.

Native customary law is administered in all the Courts, in so far as it is not incompatible with any ordinance, or rule, regulation, order, proclamation, or bye-law made under any ordinance for the time
being in force in the Colony, and not repugnant to natural justice, equity and good conscience.

Native Tribunals, presided over by Paramount or Divisional Chiefs, are established throughout the Colony, with criminal and civil jurisdiction in cases where the parties are subject thereto. Such jurisdiction has been much increased by recent legislation, and certain judicial powers have also been conferred upon State Councils and Provincial Councils.

There is an appeal from the Tribunal of a Divisional Chief to that of a Paramount Chief, and from a Paramount Chief's Tribunal to the District Commissioner's Court; but, where a title to land is in dispute, the appeal lies from the Paramount Chief's Tribunal to the Provincial Commissioner's Court.

Prisons.

There are four convict and 24 local prisons.

The convict prisons are at Accra, Sekondi, Kumasi and Tamale.

The following industries are carried on successfully:—carpentry, cabinet-making, tailoring, mat and basket making, boot and shoe making, weaving, farming, string and rope making, brick-making.

The Mark System, whereby the remission of one quarter of a sentence can be earned by hard work and good conduct, is applied to all persons sentenced to two years or more.

A Boys' Industrial Home under the control of the Salvation Army has been started at Ada.

Climate.

The climate although hot and damp, is cooler than that of most tropical countries situated in similar latitudes. The most adverse feature relative to the residence of Europeans is the very high relative humidity which only falls below 80° in the dry districts of the north and east and during the Harmattan. The average mean temperature is from 77°-81°, being greatest in the north and east and lowest in the forest area. Extremes of shade temperature have been 110° in Tamale and 49° at Kumasi.

The rainfall varies with the configuration of the country, being greatest in the south-western corner around Axim and least in the far north and coastal belt. There is the double wet season common to the Tropical Africa corresponding to the double passage of the sun, the major rains in the south being in May and June and the lesser rains in September and October. In the Northern Territories intensity of the rains is reversed and in the extreme north the passages of the sun are so near to one another in date that there is only one wet season.

The most pronounced season is the Harmattan characterised by a dry north-east wind which blows from the Sahara carrying clouds of red dust during the period of cessation of the south-west monsoon. This occurs at the period when the sun is passing southwards to the spring solstice during January and February, and the feature is the terrific desiccation of the atmosphere. A drop of 63% of relative humidity has been experienced in 24 hours with a result that papers and books curl up and the skin appears parched and dry. The daily range of temperature is more than doubled and the period is very trying to Europeans. The maximum shade temperature in 1928 was:—At Accra, 84°-9° F.; Sekondi, 85°-9° F.; Kumasi, 89°-2° F.; and Tamale, 103°-3° F. The rainfall was 27-60, 47-28, 59-18 and 39-77 inches respectively.

Mail and Steamship Services.

The African Steamship Company and the British and African Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., are under contract with the Postmaster-General for conveyance of His Majesty's mails between Liverpool and the west and south-west coasts of Africa.

Regular sailings are maintained between Liverpool and West African ports for mail, passengers and cargo. There are regular sailings from London.

A mail steamer of these companies leaves Liverpool for Lagos once a fortnight, calling at Takoradi and Accra, the usual length of voyage being 14 to 15 days, and once a month for Calabar. The amalgamation of the Lagos and Calabar Services into one has restored mail and passenger services to almost pre-war level—the running sequence being three times with 7 days interval in a month.

Cargo steamers are despatched weekly from Liverpool, and twice monthly from London, calling at the principal Gold Coast ports. Length of voyage varies from 20 to 25 days. The London steamers call occasionally at Cardiff.

Cargo steamers are despatched monthly, or as inducement offers, from New York, calling at the principal Gold Coast ports outwards and homewards. Length of voyage varies from 30 to 35 days.

Cargo steamers are despatched from Hamburg weekly, calling at Rotterdam and Antwerp for the principal Gold Coast ports. Length of voyage varies from 20 to 30 days.

Cargo steamers are despatched monthly or as inducement offers, from Canada, calling at Sierra Leone outwards and frequently at Gold Coast ports homewards. Length of voyage, about 25 days.

Elder Dempster & Co., Ltd., act as managers for these two companies, and the Agents in the Colony are the West African Lighterage and Transport Co., Ltd.

Mail and passenger steamers of the German Africa Lines (Woermann-Linie, A.G., Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie, Hamburg-America-Linie (Afrika-Dienst), and Hamburg-Bremer (Afrika-Linie) managed by the Woermann-Linie A.G. of Hamburg, leave Hamburg on the 1st and 16th of every month, via Rotterdam, Boulogne and Southampton, and go as far as Duala, calling at Takoradi and Accra. Length of voyage varies from 20 to 22 days. Homewards they call at Accra and Takoradi about the 6th/7th and 20th/21st of each month.

Cargo steamers of these lines are despatched from Hamburg to the principal Gold Coast ports five times in each month at regular intervals.

Representative:—Resident Agent, Woermann-Linie, Accra. Local Agents:—F. & A. Swanzey, Ltd., Lighterage Department.

The Holland West-Afrika Lijn, Amsterdam, maintain freight and passenger services from Hamburg, Amsterdam, Boulogne and Bordeaux to the West African ports by five sailings monthly.

The passenger steamers are despatched monthly from Hamburg via Amsterdam and Boulogne, calling at Takoradi and Accra and go as far as Duala. Homewards they call at Accra and Takoradi and reach Europe via Monrovia, Freetown and Las Palmas within fourteen days.

Cargo steamers of this line are despatched four times monthly from Hamburg, Amsterdam and Bordeaux to the principal Gold Coast ports by the Gold Coast-Benin Express Service, Liberia Ivory-Coast Service, Gold Coast-Cameroon Service and the Cameroon-Congo Service. Length of voyage varies from 17 to 27 days.

It takes the steamers of the Gold Coast-Benin Express Service about 17 days to reach Europe from the Gold Coast.

The steamers in the Liberia-Ivory Coast and Gold Coast-Cameroon Services call homewards regularly at Le Havre. Local Agents:—West African Shipping Agency and Lighterage Company.

Harbours.

The Gold Coast was for many years at a great disadvantage, in that it possessed no deep water harbour. Jetties were built at Sekondi, but owing to the continuous silting up of the harbour they cannot be used to their full capacity. At Accra a breakwater and jetty have also been constructed, but here again the silting difficulty prevents the use of anything except surf boats.

A harbour was constructed, and in 1928 opened to shipping at Takoradi, near Sekondi, which provides still-water anchorage close to the shore, and berths alongside for three ships. The scheme admits of future extensions whereby three more berths (and, if necessary, another pier with eight berths) could be provided.

Internal Communications.

Railway communication now consists of a main line running from Takoradi to Kumasi thence to Accra, a distance of 362 miles, with branches, Takoradi Junction to Secondi (3 miles), Inchaban Junction to Inchaban (4 miles), Tarkwa to Prestea (18 miles) and Huni Valley to Kade (99 miles). All three lines are 3' 6" gauge. There is a branch line Accra to Weshiang (Accra Water Works), 10 miles in length, which is 2' 6" gauge.

The railway revenue for the year 1928-29 was £1,242,947l., and the working expenditure was £98,391l. The total number of miles open for traffic on the 31st March, 1927, was 500, and the capital cost £1,37,662l.

The mileage of motor roads maintained by the Public Works Department is 1,729 miles, as follows:

| Province          | Gravel Roads | Tarred Roads | Total Miles |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Eastern and Togoland | 334         | 108          | 442         |
| Central           | 325         | 86           | 411         |
| Western           | 289         | 6            | 295         |
| Ashanti           | 173         | 160          | 333         |
| Northern Territories | 248       | Nil          | 248         |

The mileage of metalled and tarred roads has been increased to 360 miles. In addition to the 1,729 miles of motor roads which are under the control of the Public Works Department, there are some 3,900 miles of motorable roads which have been constructed and are maintained by the Chiefs. These roads are all motorable during the dry season and have opened up the country in all directions to motor traffic, and ferries have been installed and bridges built whenever necessary.

The principal waterway is the Volta River, which rises in the Kong Mountains and flows into the sea at Ada, after a course of 200 miles. It is navigable for light draught launches as far as Akuse, and, with the exception of the Krachi rapids, can be used for canoe traffic during certain seasons of the year as far as Yeji. The Ankobra River is navigable for many months of the year by surf-boats and light draught launches for a distance of 50 miles. The Tano, connected with Half Assini, by the main lagoon, and by a tramway, three miles in length, is navigable for light draught launches and canoes as far as Tanoso, a distance of about 60 miles.

Rapids at Sutri prevent this river being further utilised.

The old canoe ferry over the Volta at Senkye has been replaced by a stern wheel ferry capable of taking the largest cars and lorries.

The Government maintains a Motor Transport Service, which operates in centres where vehicles provided by private enterprise are unobtainable or more costly than a Government-owned fleet. The headquarters is at Accra, with branches at Sekondi and Kumasi. The department also handles Government cargo and officials' baggage and stores arriving by sea and arranges the coastwise shipping of Government personnel and stores between ports within the Colony.

In addition to their departmental duties, the officers of the Transport Department assist in carrying out the provisions of the Motor Traffic Ordinance by acting as Testing and Certifying Officers.

Medical Facilities.

Medical Officers are stationed at all the principal centres of the colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories. The majority of these officers travel in their districts and give treatment in village dispensaries.

There are at present 8 European Hospitals in the Gold Coast: 6 in the Colony, 1 in Ashanti and 1 in the Northern Territories.

There are 30 African Hospitals: 17 in the Colony, 4 in the Northern Territories, 6 in Ashanti and 3 in the Mandated Territory.

There are in addition two Motor Travelling Dispensaries which do excellent work in the outlying districts. A third is in course of construction.
The Gold Coast Hospital was opened at Accra in October, 1923, and does excellent and steadily increasing work and continues to grow in popularity with the native community. This hospital contains 198 beds and 18 cots, which are nearly always occupied, and has an out-patient department which treats an average of 140 cases daily. A new half block is now in course of construction which will give an additional 56 beds.

A thoroughly up-to-date Maternity Hospital in charge of a Woman Medical Officer, and containing 15 beds and 14 cots, has been opened at Korle Bu in the immediate vicinity of the Gold Coast Hospital, and is proving very popular.

Sanitation.

Sanitation is a branch of the Medical Department controlled by a Deputy Director of Sanitary Service who is responsible to the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services.

Medical Officers of Health are stationed in the larger ports and towns in the Colony, in Kumasi, and in Tamale; but all Medical Officers are charged with public health duties in their respective districts.

The infant mortality rate is somewhat high, the figure for Accra for the year 1927 being 150.

Maternity and Infant Welfare Clinics, in charge of Women Medical Officers have been established at Accra, Cape Coast, Sekondi and Kumasi, and medical inspection of school children is systematically carried out.

The voluntary welfare organization inaugurated in 1927 with a large membership of Europeans and Africans continues to do excellent work among women and children.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails exchanged fortnightly between the Colony and other British Colonies on the West Coast and the United Kingdom are carried by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and of the African Steamship Company. Mails are exchanged overland with the French sphere of Togoland and with the French Ivory Coast; and direct mails from Hamburg are received fortnightly.

There are 68 post offices and 174 postal agencies, the distribution being effected principally by rail and motor. When this is impossible a runner service is employed. The rate for letter (1 oz.) within the Empire is 1d., to the United States of America 1½d., elsewhere 3d.

There are 4,289 miles of telegraph line wire serving all the principal centres. The rate is 1/- for 12 words, and 1d. per word in excess of 12.

There are 2,061 miles of overhead line and 929 miles of underground cable circuits in use by telephone subscribers at the various exchanges throughout the Colony.

The trunk telephony system consists of 5,758 miles of double wire line linking up the following exchanges:—Abodun, Aboso, Aburi, Accra-Beach, Accra, Ada, Adawso, Adelo, Agona-Asafo, Agona-Duakwa, Akrokeri, Akropong, Akuse, Anamaba, Anyinam, Akim-Swedru, Ayimensa, Apam, Asuboi, Atwabo, Azim, Bawjiase, Bekwai, Bisa, Big Ada, Bobikuma, Cape Coast, Chito, Denu, Dixove, Dodowa, Dunkwa, Efidusiri, Eikwe, Elmina, Esiaama, Foso, Half-Assini, Ho, Huhunu, Huni Valley, Jnaso, Jumapo, Kade, Keta, Kibi, Kikam, Koforidua, Kokofu, Kpong, Kumasi, Kwaben, Kwaman, Kwanyakyi, Mampong (Ashanti), Mampong (Akwapim), Mangoase, Manso, Mpraeso, Nkawkaw, Nsaba, Nsawam, Nsute, Nyakrom, Obrahire, Obussi, Oda, Ogoli, Opon Valley, Otrope, Pakro, Paki, Salaga, Saltpond, Sekondi, Shama, Somanya, Suhum, Sunyani, Swedru, Tafo, Takoradi, Tamale, Tarkwa, Teki Man, Winneba, Wenchi, Yeji.

There are about 2,000 telephones including those in Government offices in operation.

Further extensions to the telephone system are in progress.

Passenger boats entering Takoradi are connected to the mainland telephone service and telegraph and phonogram system.

Parcel Post despatches are exchanged direct with the United Kingdom and with other British Colonies in West Africa, and the United States of America. Parcels for other countries are forwarded through the United Kingdom. The C.O.D. Service from the United Kingdom is very extensive.

British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid in the Colony, and both an inland and a foreign Money Order system is in operation.

A coastal radiotelegraph station at Takoradi transmits radiotelegrams at 9d. per word.

The Eastern Telegraph Company transmits messages by cable to any part of the world from Accra.

Education.

Education in this Colony has hitherto largely been, and is now to a still greater extent, aided and controlled by Government, and all schools are open to inspection by officers of the Education Department. From the 1st January, 1927, a new Education Ordinance came into operation, the more important of its provisions having as their aim the compulsory registration of all teachers and the awarding of definite incrementally graded salaries according to the qualifications possessed by Africans engaged in teaching.

Other effects will be to raise the quality of instruction in the schools, by the payment of grant according to the efficiency of the teachers in them, and the protection of children against “instruction” by well-meaning but ignorant persons under conditions which seriously militate against health and right progress.

Apart from a large number of non-aided primary schools, there are eighteen Government Schools and 241 Assisted Schools in the Colony and Ashanti. The latest figures show that these Government and Assisted Primary Schools have an enrolment of 34,446 pupils, of which 7,696 were girls. The largest of the Missions working in these territories is the Presbyterian Church with 102 Assisted Schools, followed next in order of size by the Wesleyan Mission with 49 Assisted Schools.

In addition to the Government Primary Schools there are the Accra Government Technical School and three Junior Trade Schools in different parts of the country. They are all boarding schools established by Government for the purpose of giving instruction in the more common building and engineering trades with simple literary and technological training.

There are also training schools controlled by the departments concerned, e.g., Posts and Telegraphs, Agriculture and Forestry, and Surveys, where pupils are boarded and trained, being paid a salary while undergoing instruction.

Teachers intended for Government service and certain others receive free board and instruction in the Training Department of the Prince of Wales’s College, Achimota.

Teachers and ministers are also trained at Wesley College, Kumasi, and at the Presbyterian Training College at Akropong, Akwapim.

The training of female teachers by Missions, under conditions of grant similar to those applying to male students at the two Mission Colleges, has commenced and four Presbyterian and eight Roman Catholic teachers are being trained.
There are two residential Secondary Schools at Cape Coast, both of which are Government aided, one being under the Wesleyan Mission and the other under the English Church Mission Local Authority.

The Roman Catholic, English Church, Wesleyan, and Presbyterian Missions each have residential Girls' Schools in which literary and domestic training is given.

Educational policy in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast has, since the 1st April, 1926, been separated from that of the Colony proper, in order that the special needs and difficulties arising with a people who are only just beginning to come much into contact with other peoples of the Gold Coast, may receive due and proper consideration.

The Prince of Wales's College, Achimota, near Accra, of which the Kindergarten and Lower Primary Departments were opened in January, 1927, while the Upper Primary and Secondary Classes commenced in 1929, forms a separate Government Department, and is to provide a complete course of instruction for boys and girls from the Kindergarten stage up to the standard of the London Intermediate Examination. It is hoped that eventually it will become a university granting degrees of its own. It will be entirely a boarding school and while open to pupils of all nationalities and religions will be based on the teaching of the Christian faith. The usual primary and secondary school subjects will be taught, with arts and science, and there will be agricultural, manual and domestic training, and an engineering school. The College will also train teachers for Government and Assisted Schools. All teaching in the College is to be based on a vernacular foundation and in the lowest classes instruction will be given in four African languages. An effort will be made throughout to keep local conditions in view.

Currency and Banking.

Prior to 1912 and 1913 the currency consisted chiefly of British gold (comparatively rare), silver and copper. In 1912, subsidiary nickel-bronze coins (1d., ½d. and —d. pieces) were introduced, and in 1913 a special silver currency common to all the British West African Colonies of the same weight and fineness as the corresponding British coins. The coins issued are 2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d. pieces. Owing to the great increase in the demand for currency and the difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies, it was found necessary in 1915 to make British Treasury Notes legal tender, and in 1916 special West African Currency Notes were introduced. 20s. and 10s. Notes are the only values now in circulation, 5l., 2s. and 1s. Notes having been withdrawn. In 1920, owing to the rapid disappearance of silver coins, an alloy coinage was introduced of the same denominations as the silver coins and silver has now practically been withdrawn from circulation. The special West Africa silver and alloy currency and the West African Currency Notes are under the management of the West African Currency Board and are secured by sterling securities held by the Board. Current British gold and silver coins, British 20s. and 10s. Treasury Notes, West Africa Currency silver and alloy coins, West African Currency Notes, and West Africa nickel-bronze coins are all legal tender.

The Bank of British West Africa, Limited, opened at Accra on the 1st January, 1897, and now has branches at all the principal business centres in the Colony.

The Colonial Bank (now Barclay's Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd.) began business at Accra in 1917, and branches have now been opened at other centres. Both Banks have a savings department.

In 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established which is now under Post Office management. On 31st December, 1928, the amount to the credit of depositors was 90,761L

Accounts are kept in sterling.

Population.

The first attempt to take a census was made in 1891, which, however, covered the Colony only. Since then a census has been made at ten-year intervals, viz.:—1891, 1911 and 1921. Except in 1901, the whole of Ashanti and the Northern Territories have been included. In a country such as the Gold Coast, imperfect communications and lack of education make the holding of a complete census a matter of great difficulty and even now the figures cannot be considered absolutely accurate.

The resident population on census day, 1921, was as follows:—

|                |        |
|----------------|--------|
| The Colony     | 1,174,971 |
| Ashanti        | 406,640  |
| Northern Territories | 530,391 |

Total: 2,112,002

Of this total, 2,384 were non-Africans, the majority being British. The population of the British sphere of Togoland was 187,959, of whom 20 were non-Africans. The grand total therefore for the area administered by the Gold Coast Government was 2,299,961. There was also a maritime population of 1,028 in the various harbours on census day.

The African population of the chief towns was as follows:—

| Town          | Population |
|---------------|------------|
| Accra         | 38,049     |
| Kumasi        | 23,694     |
| Cape Coast    | 14,921     |
| Keta          | 9,839      |
| Sekondi       | 9,500      |
| Teshi         | 7,604      |
| Winneba       | 6,980      |
| Saltpond      | 6,342      |
| Nsawam        | 6,143      |
| Asamankese    | 5,413      |
| Koforidua     | 5,364      |

Trade and Industries.

The chief products of the Colony are cocoa, gold and manganese. Palm oil, palm kernels, lumber, kola and copra are also shipped.

The cultivation of cocoa was started in Akwapim in 1879, and exports in 1891 realised 4l. Coffee at that time fetched a fair price, and it was not until 1898, when the price for the latter article fell so low as to make its cultivation at any distance from the coast unremunerative, that attention was paid to cocoa. Since that year the cocoa industry has made rapid strides. In 1900 the value exported was 27,280L, in 1918, 1,796,980L, and in 1920, 10,066,298L. In 1921, although the value fell considerably to 4,764,067L, the quantity of cocoa exported exceeded the 1920 export by 8,423 tons. In 1925, 218,151 tons, valued at 8,222,283L; in 1928, 226,007 tons, valued at 11,229,512L were exported respectively. There is a tax of ½d. a penny per lb. on cocoa exported.

Gold has been exported from the Gold Coast more or less continuously since the discovery of the country by Europeans in the fifteenth century. Up to 1874, however, the industry was almost entirely in the hands of the natives. The first company for gold mining in West Africa was founded in 1874, but did little beyond exploration.
A second company, formed in 1879, engaged in mining operations in the neighbourhood of Tar-
quaun, and from that year the progress of mining enterprise is indicated by the rapid increase in the exports of gold bars, the result of European operations, as compared with those of gold dust, the produce of native mining. In 1899 there was a very remarkable development of the mining industry, which, though checked for a while by the disturbances in Ashanti, received a fresh impetus from the passing of the Concessions Ordinance in 1900, the progress of the railway, and general improvement in means of transport.

Gold is widely diffused throughout the Colony, Ashanti, and some parts of the Northern Territories, in quartz and alluvial deposits, while in Wassaw there is good conglomerate or banket formation which is now reported to extend to the Birrim District in the Eastern Province. The rivers are said to be rich in alluvial deposits. From the year 1903 (the first in which reliable statistics of production were kept) to 1921, the gold produced in the colony and Ashanti amounted to 5,062,267 fine-ozs., valued at 21,504,750l. The highest annual production was in 1914, viz.:—410,656 fine ozs., valued at 1,744,498l. In 1928 the value of gold and gold dust exported was 684,815l. Bitumen is found along the banks of the river Bonni, in Apollonia and the stream Akyikyiri, flowing into the Ehi lagoon near Half Aminis. Extensive deposits of Bauxite exist, the most important being situated near Mpraseo in the Kwahu district where a large quantity of high grade ore has been located. In the Eastern Province near Kibi diamonds have been found, and the alluvial is being worked. The diamond exports in 1925 were 77,313 carats, valued at 98,760l.; in 1928, 698,826 carats, valued at 584,279l. Small diamonds have also been found in other localities.

Manganese exists in large quantities close to the railway line about 33 miles from the port of Sekondi, and the shipments of this ore reached 338,657 tons in 1925 and 324,499 tons in 1928. New machinery is being installed at the mines, which is expected to raise the capacity for output to between 360,000 and 400,000 tons per annum. With the provision of proper shipping facilities at the port of Takoradi, now under construction, manganese will improve its position as one of the Colony's most valuable exports.

The trade in products of the oil-palm has suffered severely in the last quarter of a century from the competition of cacao, and except in certain localities, notably the Volta River District, the farming of this kind of produce is neglected. The potential wealth of the Gold Coast oil-palm however is great, and every encouragement is given to the chiefs to start new plantations.

11,039,149 lbs. of Kola valued at 178,671l. were exported by sea during 1928, almost entirely to Nigeria; in 1926, 12,470,028 lbs. of Kola Nuts, valued at 259,479l.; and in 1927, 11,487,312 lbs., valued at 191,380l. Kola is also exported overland in a northerly direction but statistics of this trade cannot be kept.

An experimental sisal hemp plantation was started by Government in 1920 near Accra for the purpose of demonstrating to the people scientific methods of cultivating and harvesting this plant in order to induce them to take up the industry. The first shipment, of about 10 tons, was made in October, 1924, whilst the total for the year was 86 tons. The fibre is of good quality and can be prepared and shipped at present prices with a large margin of profit. The exports of the commodity in 1925, amounted to 178 tons, valued at 6,996l.; in 1926, 456 tons, valued at 18,196l.; in 1927, 280 tons, valued at 9,794l.; and in 1928, 122 tons valued 3,372l.

The values of the following exports for 1928 were:

| Item          | Value       |
|---------------|-------------|
| Cacao         | £11,229,512 |
| Gold (raw)    | 684,815     |
| Manganese Ore | 610,209     |
| Kola Nuts     | 178,671     |
| Lumber        | 138,853     |
| Palm Kernels  | 103,906     |
| Palm Oil      | 13,516      |
| Copra         | 32,246      |
| Diamonds      | 584,279     |

The first in value of the imports in 1928 was cotton piece goods, followed by motor cars and silk goods, but there is a steady demand for provisions, spirits and malt liquors, hardware, motor spirit, bags and sacks, flour, cement and lime, machinery, soap, illuminating and lubricating oils and building materials. The use of motor transport is rapidly extending in the colony; in 1928, the number of motor cars and lorries imported was 2,579.

Native manufactures are insignificant. Cloths are woven in many parts of the country, for the most part of English spun yarn, but in the northern districts occasionally of thread manufactured from the indigenous cotton plant. Narrow strips of four to six inches are woven on a rough hand loom, and stitched together to make clothes of various sizes. Gold and brass are worked by native smiths; canoes are made on the coast rivers; pottery for domestic purposes is made by hand, and wood-carving is done chiefly in Ashanti and Kwahu. Salt is roughly prepared from the lagoons between Accra and Quittah, and sent up country to the markets of the Northern Territories. Fishing is extensively carried on along the coast, and large quantities of sun-dried fish are sent to the villages and markets of the interior.

ASHANTI.

Ashanti is inhabited by a large number of confederated tribes, the principal of which are the Bekwai, Adansi, Kokofus, Nkwantas, Kumasis, Agunas, Mampons, Nautas, Kumawus, Bompatas, Juabins and Ejius. Each tribe has its own Head Chief, but from time immemorial the King of Kumasi was recognised as the King paramount of the Confederation.

In 1873 the King of Ashanti invaded the British Protectorate with a large army, and reached Elmina, where he was entirely defeated by the British forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) Francis Festing. Later in the year Captain (afterwards Sir) John Glover was sent to the eastern districts of the Protectorate to organise the tribes in that quarter, for a flank movement against the Ashanti territory. At the same time Sir Garnet, (afterwards Viscount) Wolseley was despatched to the Gold Coast, with British and West Indian troops, native levies, and some seamen and marines, to operate against the Ashantis, starting from Cape Coast. On the 31st of January, 1874, he came into general engagement with the enemy at Amoeful,
where he drove them from their position after desperate resistance. The next four days were employed continuously in fighting, until, on the evening of the 4th of February, the British force entered Kumasi. The King had fled to the bush.

A few days later Sir John Glover also reached Kumasi. On the 13th, messengers sent by the King concluded a peace with Sir Garnet Wolseley at Fomana, which was afterwards signed with a pencil cross by King Kofi. By the Treaty of Fomana, the King of Ashanti renounced all claims on the Protectorate, promised to protect traders, to abandon human sacrifices, and to pay an indemnity of 50,000 ozs. of gold.

In 1894 Prempeh, who was then King of Kumasi, and had successfully fought against the Nkoranza, who had revolted against his rule, threatened to attack the Atebubus. This attack was averted by the despatch of a force under Sir Francis Scott, and an ultimatum was then sent to Prempeh warning him not to enter British territory, and suggesting that he should acquiesce in the establishment of a Residency at Kumasi. No definite reply to this suggestion could be obtained, and a military expedition accordingly proceeded to Kumasi, to compel compliance with the demands of Her Majesty's Government. The expedition, under the command of Sir Francis Scott, entered Kumasi without resistance, January, 1896. Prempeh made submission, but, failing to comply with the terms dictated, was brought to the coast as a political prisoner and lodged in Elmira Castle, whence he was eventually deported to the Seychelles. A Resident was at the same time installed at Kumasi, and thus commenced an entirely new departure in the relations of the Gold Coast Colony with Ashanti.

In 1900 the Governor visited Kumasi, and was there besieged by the Ashantis, the town being closely invested. Provisions ran short, and a part of the garrison, with the Governor, cut their way out; the rest were relieved by Colonel (afterwards Sir J.) Willcocks, commanding the Ashanti Field Force, on 16th July, after severe fighting. The Ashantis were subsequently thoroughly routed at Abosu.

An Order of the King in Council, dated September 26th, 1901, defined the boundaries of Ashanti, annexed it to His Majesty's Dominions, and provided for its administration under the Governor of the Gold Coast. Ashanti is under a Chief Commissioner, with Commissioners of Provinces and Districts under him. By a subsequent Order in Council of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Colony and Ashanti, and between Ashanti and the Northern Territories, were re-adjusted and defined, with due regard to tribal lands and natural features.

Ashanti is now divided into two provinces, the Eastern with headquarters at Kumasi and the Western with headquarters at Sunyani. Each of these is subdivided into districts under a District Commissioner who exercises limited jurisdiction; as does also a Police Magistrate in the town of Kumasi.

In 1919 a Circuit Judge was appointed for Ashanti. This officer relieves the Chief Commissioner of practically all judicial work except civil cases and matters in which native customary law is applicable.

The peaceful relations which, under the auspices of the Gold Coast Government, have existed for many years now between the Ashantis and the neighbouring tribes have been signified by not infrequent petitions emanating from the Gold Coast Colony as well as from Ashanti for the return from exile of Prempeh, the former Chief of Kumasi. The confidence felt by the Government of the Gold Coast in the loyalty of the Ashanti people led to the granting of this request in 1924, and to approval being given in 1926 of his election by his people as Omanhene or Head Chief of the Kumasi tribe.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES.

In 1897 the territories to the north of Ashanti were constituted a separate district with the title of "The Northern Territories," and placed in charge of a Commissioner, and a grant-in-aid of the expenditure in the Northern Territories was voted by Parliament.

Major H. P. Northcott was appointed Commissioner and Commandant of these territories, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. The negotiations between the British and French Governments for the settlement of territorial questions in West Africa, which had been suspended in 1896, were resumed in October, 1897; and on 14th June, 1898, after a period of considerable tension in consequence of the proximity of the British and French forces in the disputed territories, a Convention was signed at Paris with a proviso that it should be ratified within six (subsequently extended to twelve) months. By this Convention the boundary between the Gold Coast and the French Colony of the Ivory Coast, which had only been settled in 1889, as far as the 9th parallel of north latitude, was continued northwards along the course of the Black Volta River to the 11th parallel, and it was then drawn along the 11th parallel with a deflection to the north in the neighbourhood of Mamprusi, until it met the Franco-German boundary of 1897. The effect of the Anglo-French Convention of 14th June, 1898, was to leave Bona, Lobi, and Moshie to France, while Dagati, Wa, Mamprusi, and the southern portion of Gunshu were included in the British sphere.

On 14th November, 1899, an agreement was concluded with Germany for the partition of the "neutral zone." This partition assigned Salaga to Great Britain, and Yendi to Germany, and to the north of the zone gave Mamprusi to the former and Chakosi to the latter.

Survey operations were undertaken by Anglo-French and Anglo-German Commissions during 1901-2, for the delimitation of those portions of the boundaries which had not yet been settled.

By the demarcation on the ground of the Anglo-German boundary between the Trans-Volta District and the adjoining Colony of Togo; of the Anglo-German boundary north of the 9th parallel of north latitude; and of the Anglo-French boundary along the 11th parallel of north latitude, all the frontiers of the Colony, Ashanti and the Northern Territories have now been exactly defined.

Provision was made for the administration of the Northern Territories under the Gold Coast Government by an Order of the King in Council of 26th September, 1901, and by an Administrative Ordinance of January 1st, 1902, the Northern Territories were placed under a Chief Commissioner, and divided into the White Volta, Black Volta, Rintampo and Gonja Districts with headquarters at Gambaga, Wa, Kintampo and Salaga.
By orders of 1927, the country was re-divided as follows:

Northern Province, consisting of the districts of Navorungo; Kusasi (Protectorate Section of), Southern Mamprusi (Protectorate Section of), Lawra-Tumu, Wa and Zuarungu.

Southern Province, consisting of Western Dagambas, Eastern Gonja (Protectorate Section of), and Western Gonja.

The Districts are presided over by Commissioners, who are responsible to the Chief Commissioner and have Courts of Justice, with appeal to the Chief Commissioner at Tamale.

By Order in Council, of the 22nd of October, 1906, the boundaries between the Northern Territories and Ashanti were re-adjusted and defined.

An important step was taken with regard to the Government of this Protectorate by replacing, with effect from the 1st of January, 1907, the former semi-military administration by a staff of Civil District and Assistant District Commissioners, and by establishing new stations. Simultaneously, the 2nd Battalion of the Gold Coast Regiment was disbanded and a force of armed constabulary substituted therefor. In 1929, the Northern Territories Constabulary was disbanded and their duties taken over by the Gold Coast Police.

In 1920 the Circuit Judge, Ashanti, was appointed to exercise in the Northern Territories powers similar to those which he exercises in Ashanti.

THE BRITISH SPHERE OF TOGO-LAND.

The former German protectorate of Togoland is situated on the Gulf of Guinea, bounded on the east by Dahomey and on the west by the Gold Coast and its Protectorates. The actual coast-line lies between 1° 45' and 1° 14' W. longitude, the frontiers, however, especially on the west, opening out considerably. The total area is about 36,500 square miles.

Until 1884-85 the majority of the tribes along the littoral and its immediate hinterland, also those adjoining the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast regarded themselves as being under the suzerainty of Great Britain, but by agreements made with the French on the 24th December, 1885, and with the British on the 14th and 28th July, 1886, when provisional frontiers were fixed, German influence was formally recognized by those Powers. Subsequent agreements dated the 23rd July, 1897, and the 14th November, 1899, between Germany and the Governments of France and Great Britain respectively defined the northern frontiers of Togoland.

Immediately upon the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany Togoland was invaded by the Gold Coast forces. On the 6th August, 1914, Captain E. B. Barker entered the capital, Lome, under a flag of truce and on the following day that town and the hinterland for a distance of 120 kilometers from the sea were surrendered. On the 8th August Anecho (Petit Popo) was occupied by the French. Operations on a larger scale commenced on the 11th August when Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel F. C. Bryant landed at Lome. After engagements at Agbelufoe and Chra River on the 16th and 24th August respectively the enemy retired on the great wireless station at Kamina, which they destroyed. On the 26th August the Acting-Governor surrendered the Colony unconditionally.

Pour parlers then took place between Sir Hugh Clifford, governor of the Gold Coast, and M. Noufflard, governor of Dahomey, as the result of which an agreement, subsequently ratified by the governments concerned was drawn up. Under this agreement Togoland was provisionally divided into British and French spheres. To the British were allotted the western administrative areas of Lome and Lomeland, Misahoe, Kete-Krachi and Yendi, and to the French Anecho, Atakpame, Sokode and Sansanne Mangu.

By proclamation dated the 30th September, 1914, civil courts were established under the presidency of political officers seconded from the Gold Coast, appeal lying from the district courts to that of a senior political officer. In the absence of a local criminal code, that of the Gold Coast was introduced as a basis of procedure.

In June, 1915, the office of senior political officer was merged in that of the senior military commander, without prejudice, however, to the civil nature of the court concerned.

Boundary adjustments with the French took place in 1920 in accordance with an agreement signed by Lord Milner and M. Simon on 10th July, 1919. Lome and the whole of the coast were given over to the French, and the British received additional territory in the interior. The area of the British sphere is 13,040 square miles.

In October, 1921, the Council of the League of Nations approved in principle the arrangements made between the British and French Governments for the division of Togoland in accordance with the agreement of 10th July, 1919, and the application to the territories of the Mandate system; and on 20th July, 1922, after a delay due to negotiations between the United States Government and the Mandatory Powers, the Council confirmed the mandates and defined their terms.*

The British Sphere of Togoland is now administered under the provisions of the British Sphere of Togoland Order in Council, 1923, which was issued on the 11th of October, 1923.

Under this instrument, the British Sphere is divided into the Northern Section and the Southern Section. The Northern Section is administered as if it formed part of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast, and the Southern Section is administered as if it formed part of the Eastern Province of the Gold Coast Colony. The Chief Commissioner's Court of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast exercises jurisdiction in the Northern Section; and the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast Colony exercises the jurisdiction in the Southern Section.

Subject to the terms of the Mandate, the law for the time being in force in the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast is the law in force in the Northern Section, and the law for the time being in force in the Gold Coast Colony is the law in force in the Southern Section. The Governor of the Gold Coast Colony is empowered to enact Ordinances with respect to the British Sphere as a whole, or with respect to either Section thereof separately. The British Sphere of Togoland is not distinguished from the Gold Coast in the statistical returns, but it is beyond question that the revenue which it brings to the Gold Coast is inconsiderable compared with the money expended upon it. It contains no part of the old German railway system, which retains most of the export and import trade of the Southern and richest

Section. The towns of Ho and Kpandu are joined to the Gold Coast road system by a road which meets the Volta River at Senchi where there is a motor ferry. There is also a direct road from Yendi to Tamale, but the Gold Coast cannot offer prices sufficiently attractive to induce the people to abandon their accustomed market centres on the Lome Railway.
