TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

TRINIDAD

SITUATION AND AREA

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is 50 miles, its average breadth 37 miles, and its area 1,864 square miles. It is separated from S. America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, and Venezuela is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad on 1st January, 1889, by an Order-in-Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44.

CLIMATE

The climate of Trinidad is tropical and may be divided into two seasons, a dry season from January to the middle of May, with an average rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December, with an average of 8 inches per month. The coolest months of the year are December to April. The average temperature during the day is 84 and during the night 74. The average yearly rainfall is 70 inches. The climate is healthy and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided reasonable precautions are taken.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising to 3,085 feet; the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao and coconuts, which are its staples.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain, situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria.

POPULATION

The population of Trinidad and Tobago on 31st December, 1948, was estimated to be 602,814.

The population of the principal towns at 31st December, 1948, was estimated to be:

- Port of Spain: 100,251
- San Fernando: 31,161
- Arima: 8,717
- Princes Town: 7,991

The white population is chiefly composed of English, Portuguese, French and Spanish. There is also a large number of East Indians, estimated at 31st December, 1948, to be 214,177. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Census—1901: 255,148
1911: 333,552
1921: 362,780
1931: 412,783
1946: 557,970

The birth rate per thousand in 1948 was 40·25 and the death rate 12·26.

RELIGION

Seventy per cent. of the population are adherents of Christian denominations and, amongst these, the Roman Catholic and Anglican communities are by far the largest having followings of 34 per cent. and 24 per cent. respectively of the total population of the Colony. The non-Christian element is almost entirely Hindu or Moslem, the number of Hindus being only slightly less than the number of Anglicans.

The Roman Catholic Church in the Colony is headed by an Archbishop and the Anglican by a Bishop, both with Cathedral Churches in Port of Spain. There is a seminar for aspirants to the Catholic priesthood and one theological college run by the Presbyterian Church in Trinidad (Canadian Mission).

There are also in the Colony adherents of the following denominations and religions:

- Methodist, Church of Scotland (Presbyterian),
- Baptist, Moravian, Presbyterian Church in Trinidad (Canadian Mission), Seventh Day Adventist, African Methodist, Episcopal, Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, Pilgrim Holiness, Brethren, Christian Science and Church of God together with a divisional Headquarters of the Salvation Army.

HISTORY

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Roume de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.
The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

After the capitulation the system of Spanish government, including Spanish law, continued. In 1801 Governor Picton instituted a Council of Advice consisting of five nominated members of the community and this existed concurrently with the Cabildo, "a body corporate that partook of the mixed nature of an ecclesiastical council, a parish vestry, a municipal corporation, and a council of government", over which the Governor had presided under Spanish rule. Between 1801 and 1803 the Council of Government became His Majesty's Council, and laws, which were promulgated by the Governor after having received the advice of the Council, were termed Orders of Government. In 1831 a Council of Government (Legislative Council) was created, consisting of six officials and six non-officials. Thereafter laws styled Ordinances have been enacted by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Council. An Executive Council was also set up in 1831 to assist the Governor with its advice in matters connected with the administration of the executive government. In 1840 the Cabildo was replaced by the Port of Spain City Council, and Spanish law was repealed in toto in 1845. In 1848 the Island was divided into divisions, counties, districts and wards and in 1845 and 1888 borough councils were established in the towns of San Fernando and Arima respectively.

East Indian immigration was introduced in 1845 and continued until the war of 1914–18. Chinese and Portuguese immigrants were also introduced into Trinidad around the middle of the nineteenth century. Trinidad is today the most cosmopolitan of the British West Indian islands.

In accordance with the terms of the Bases Agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America which was signed on 27th March, 1941 certain areas have been leased to the United States for 99 years and have been occupied and developed as naval or army air bases.

**CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION**

The constitution of Trinidad and Tobago is provided for by Royal Instructions 1924–41, Royal Letters Patent 1924–41 and the Trinidad and Tobago (Legislative Council) Orders in Council 1924–45.

The government is administered by a Governor with an Executive Council consisting of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary ex-officio and such other persons not being ex-officio members as may from time to time be appointed. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, six nominated unofficial members and nine elected members.

Trinidad and Tobago is divided into administrative districts as follows:

1. County of St. George, excluding City of Port of Spain and Borough of Arima—6 wards.
2. County of Caroni—4 wards.
3. County of Victoria, excluding Borough of San Fernando—5 wards.
4. County of St. Patrick—4 wards.
5. Eastern Counties of St. Andrew, St. David, Nariva and Mayaro—10 wards.
6. Island Ward of Tobago—7 parishes.

The nine elected members of the Legislative Council represent North Port of Spain, South Port of Spain, San Fernando, and the six districts shown above respectively. The first general election under adult franchise was held in July, 1946, and 52·9 per cent. out of a total electorate of 259,512 voted.

Each administrative district is under a Warden who, with his staff of officers, supervises the affairs of the several wards. These include the assessment and collection of taxes on land and buildings, the collection of revenue accruing from land sales, royalties, licences, fees, etc. The Wardens are also responsible for the maintenance of government lands and buildings, Crown traces, fire control, markets, abattoirs, public cemeteries, recreation grounds, game preservation, the preservation of historic sites, the supply of water to areas devoid of water supply, the management of government schools, and rural labour bureaux. Each Warden is statutory chairman of the local health authority, old age pension and poor relief board and fire vigilance committee of his area. In addition he reports to Government on the general health, educational, agricultural conditions etc., of his area.

In 1946 County Councils were introduced as advisory bodies. For this purpose the Colony is divided into seven electoral districts, the Eastern Counties being sub-divided into the two electoral districts of St. Andrew-St. David and Nariva-Mayaro respectively. Two councillors are elected for each ward and the chairman of the County Council is the elected member of the Legislative Council for that district. The first election, based on adult suffrage, took place in October, 1946, and 36·8 per cent. of a total electorate of 189,351 voted.

**Municipalities.—** There are three municipalities, one in the city of Port of Spain and the others in the boroughs of San Fernando and Arima. These municipalities are regulated by local ordinances. The Port of Spain City Council is comprised of five aldermen and fifteen councillors who hold office for three years. One-third of these go out of office each year. The Mayor is elected from among the aldermen and councillors. The San Fernando Borough Council has three aldermen and nine councillors and the Arima Borough Council, three aldermen and six councillors. Only qualified burgesses are allowed to vote: adult franchise has not yet been introduced.

A new constitution is being drafted for the Colony. It provides for a Government vested in a Governor, an Executive Council (which is to be the chief instrument of policy and is to consist of three ex officio members, one nominated member and five elected members elected by the Legislative Council) and a Legislative Council of three ex officio members, five nominated and 18 elected members. The Legislative Council will be presided over by a Speaker who will be appointed by the Governor from outside the Chamber and who will have neither an original nor a casting vote. Arrangements will be made for the unofficial member of the Executive Council to be actively associated with the work of Government departments.

The following colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys:—The Queen’s Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary’s College and Fatima College in Port of Spain, Presentation College and the Naparima College in San Fernando, the Bishop’s High School in Tobago (co-educational). The St. Joseph’s Convent and the Bishop Anstey High School in Port of Spain, and the Naparima Girls’ High School and St. Joseph’s Convent at San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen’s Royal College, provide similar education for girls.

The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen’s Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid.

There are three training colleges for teachers, the Government Training College, the Roman Catholic Training College for Women in Port of Spain, and the Naparima Training College (Presbyterian) in San Fernando.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906.

Information Services

An Information Office serves as a channel of communication between the Government and the people by utilising the press, radio and other forms of publicity; issues all Government advertisements; supplies information and issues a weekly press résumé and weekly newsletter to organisations and interested persons abroad; and provides the people with information about developments in Great Britain and various aspects of British life through the distribution of films, literature, photographs, etc.

Health

The expenditure by the Health Department in 1948 was $3,149,135.90$, representing 8.2% of the total expenditure of the Colony.

There are three Colonial Hospitals, a Colony Mental Hospital, a Leprosarium at Chacachacare supervised by the Dominican and Mercy Sisters, a Tuberculosis Hospital, a Veneral Diseases Hospital, two Houses of Refuge, and eight District Hospitals. A tuberculosis sanatorium is nearing completion.

Health Centres and rural dispensaries are maintained in townships and larger villages.

The total population for 1948 was estimated at 602,814, with a birth rate of 40.25 per 1,000, infant mortality rate of 75.48 per 1,000 live births, and death rate of 12.26 per 1,000.

The public health programme is administered through the following divisions and units: malaria, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, dental, ‘health education, maternity and infant welfare, nutrition, yaws and hookworm.

The principal diseases of economic importance are malaria, hookworm, pulmonary tuberculosis, venereal diseases and malnutrition.

The ten principal causes of death are diseases of early infancy, pulmonary tuberculosis, diseases of old age, cardiac and valvular diseases, diarrhoea and enteric, cancer, broncho-pneumonia, cerebral haemorrhage, bronchitis and nephritis.

Labour Services

These include the promotion of industrial relations and collective bargaining, fostering the development of organisations of employers and employees, a system of labour bureaux in important industrial centres, inspection of factories and workshops and the control of immigrant labourers entering the colony on contracts of service.

Full particulars on education, health and labour matters will be found in the annual report of the colony and the annual departmental reports of the respective departments.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

The roads are divided into main and local roads. The former and 59.94 per cent. of the latter are under the control of the Works and Hydraulics Department. The other local roads amounting to 518 miles are under local road boards. The main roads, with a total mileage of 1,067 miles are made up of 651 miles metalled or gravelled and sealed, 159 miles metalled, 141 miles gravelled and 116 miles natural soil roads. The local roads in districts where there are no local road boards comprise 775 miles and are made up of 173 miles metalled or gravelled and oiled, 107 miles metalled, 229 miles gravelled and 266 miles natural soil roads. In addition there are many miles of Crown tracks in charge of the Wardens.

The city of Port of Spain is served by a tramway system, which is gradually being replaced by trolley buses, operated by the Port of Spain City Council. Motor omnibuses supply the transport needs of the residents in the suburban areas.

Railways

The railway system consists of a total length of 118 miles, of which the first line opened in 1897 runs from Port of Spain to Arima and Sangre Grande along the southern foothills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the coast, the length of the line being 29 miles.

The line to San Fernando and Siparia, 44 miles long, leaves the former at St. Joseph Junction. The first section to Couva was opened in 1880, extended to San Fernando in 1882, and the further extension to Siparia was opened in 1913.

The Caparo Valley line from Jerningham Junction to Rio Claro, 28½ miles long, was opened to Tabaquite in 1898 and extended to Rio Claro in 1914.

The Guaracara line from Marabella Junction to Princes Town, 10 miles long, was opened in 1884.

The railway has three regular trains daily each way, between Port of Spain and all termini. In addition, frequent suburban trains are run...
serving the residential districts of Tunapuna, St. Augustine and San Juan.

Regular goods trains are provided on all lines, and in addition, special sugar cane trains supply each sugar factory daily during the sugar crop season.

The Railway Ancillary Services provide motor omnibus connections from the termini to the coast in all directions—Blanchisseuse, Matelot, Toco, Mayaro, Guayaguayare, Moruga, Cedros and Point Fortin. A number of inland areas are also served by motor omnibuses. The service maintained permits residents from any of the outlying points to travel by omnibus and rail from their homes to Port of Spain and back the same day.

The Railway Ancillary Goods Service is operated in conjunction with the railway, and collection or delivery is arranged as required. Regular goods services are run by road to Blanchisseuse and Cedros. Goods services are also operated in Tobago.

The railway is equipped with telegraph and telephone communication throughout the system, and telegrams are accepted for transmission between any two stations, with arrangements for delivery within a reasonable radius of the receiving station.

The total number of passengers carried during 1948 was 5,378,000, and the volume of goods transported was 584,334 tons. The total receipts from the railway, telegraph and road services in 1948 amounted to $2,061,754.

**Asphalt.**—The asphalt lake, 109 acres in extent lies at La Brea. The quantity produced in 1948 was 128,993 tons compared with 87,346 tons in 1947.

**Petroleum.**—Crude petroleum and natural gas are produced in the southern part of the island. The industry at present consists of 11 operating companies. Four companies operate shipping terminals and two maintain refineries, purchasing crude oil from other local companies as well as producing it themselves. Foreign crude oil is also imported from Venezuela, the refined products being re-exported. The greater part of the refinery output is disposed of in the local bunker trade and in shipments to the United Kingdom. Production of crude oil in 1948 amounted to 20,110,901 barrels compared with 20,520,186 barrels in 1947.

**Other mineral products.**—No ore deposits of economic importance have as yet been discovered in Trinidad. There is, however, a large amount of limestone in the Northern Range which is worked for building stone, road metal, concrete mixing, etc. Small deposits of white sand exist of a quality suitable for glass making. A plant to manufacture glass is being erected and will be in operation shortly.

**Sugar.**—There are approximately 82,000 acres of land under sugar cane. In 1948 the sugar crop yielded 115,941 tons compared with 110,068 tons in 1947. About two-thirds of the total production of sugar cane is grown on estates owned and operated by sugar companies, the remaining third being produced by peasant cane-farmers. In 1948 cane farmers produced 34.91 per cent. out of a total of 1,156,377 tons of cane ground. There are ten sugar factories.

No molasses was exported in 1948, the bulk of the supply available being used in the manufacture of rum. Rum production in 1948 amounted to 3,015,486 proof gallons, compared with 3,087,105 proof gallons in 1947.

**Cocoa.**—There are about 100,000 acres under cocoa, divided approximately equally between estates of 50 acres and under farmed by peasant proprietors, and estates of over 50 acres maintained by planters. In 1948, 18,285,605 lb. of cocoa valued at $8,353,312 was exported, compared with 9,009,644 lb. valued at $3,205,049 in 1947.

All copra produced in 1948 was delivered to the factories for oil extraction and processing. Processed products include edible oil, coconut oil, lard compound, margarine, butter substitute and laundry soap. In addition to meeting the Colony’s requirements, surpluses valued at $72,210 were exported within the Caribbean area.

**Citrus.**—There are about 12,000 acres under citrus. Besides grapefruit there are also exports of distilled lime oil, raw lime juice, fresh limes, citrate of lime and fresh oranges. There is a very heavy local consumption of oranges. The lime industry is declining owing to the premature dying out of trees. The greater part of the grapefruit industry is handled by the Co-operative Citrus Growers’ Association.

**Other crops.**—Both robusta and arabica coffee are grown mostly as an interplanted crop and on road boundaries or cocoa plantations. The greater part of the arabica crop is consumed locally but a considerable surplus of robusta is
exported. In 1948 a total of 1,450 lb. of raw coffee valued at $528 was exported, compared with 1,265,675 lb. valued at $250,014 in 1947.

There are about 6,000 acres under tonca beans. Exports during 1948 totalled 105,959 lb. valued at $93,335, compared with 204,176 lb. valued at $196,575 in 1947.

During the war years the entire rubber production of the Colony was by agreement made available to the Government of the United States of America through the agency of the Rubber Development Corporation. In 1946 over 500,000 lb. were produced but with the expiration of the agreement in June 1947 the present world price for the commodity is uneconomic as far as this Colony is concerned. Exports during 1948 totalled 72,728 lb. valued at $2,318.

Ground provisions, vegetables and rice are also produced for local consumption. Local food in general is being produced in greater and more balanced proportions. The colony is still, however, largely dependent on imported food supplies, especially flour and meat.

Of a total area of 1,267,236 acres (Trinidad 1,192,844 and Tobago 74,392) approximately half has been alienated. There are approximately 578,000 acres under state forest after deducting an estimated 40,000 acres of swamp and savannah. Soil and forest conservation is practised.

Minor industries include the manufacture of bricks and tiles, lumber, charcoal, furniture, concrete products, shirts, cigarettes, matches, beer, aerated waters, biscuits, chocolate, confectionery, bay rum.

TOBAGO

SITUATION AND AREA

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. latitude and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. longitude, distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 116 square miles, or 74,392 acres, of which about 51,905 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Tobago is a ward of Trinidad and its exports all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, livestock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1948 was $2,029,228, made up as follows:

| Product                  | Value   |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Cocoa                    | $1,369,900 |
| Coconuts and coconut fibre| $41,947  |
| Copra                    | $364,051  |
| Other products           | $253,330  |

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about eight miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

POPULATION

| Year | Male | Female | Total |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1901 | 8,671| 10,080 | 18,751 |
| 1911 | 9,922| 10,827 | 20,749 |
| 1921 | 11,194| 12,184 | 23,378 |
| 1931 | 12,280| 13,078 | 25,358 |
| 1946 | 13,162| 13,999 | 27,161 |

The population of Scarborough at 31st December, 1948, was estimated to be 1,100.

HISTORY

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the "Darling" and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealander were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commodore Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

CONSTITUTION

The government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order-in-Council of 7th February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order-in-Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order-in-Council of 20th October, 1898, the Order-in-Council of 17th November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad: that all future ordinances of the legislature of the colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the legislature should be able to enact special and local ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the colony.

This Order-in-Council was brought into effect from 1st January, 1899, by a proclamation of the
Governor issued on 8th December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.

Warden, Tobago—T. C. Cambridge.

COMMUNICATIONS

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, a coastal steamer service provided by the Government, and an air service provided by the British West Indian Airways, Ltd.

The island possesses a fair mileage of motor roads and is served by the railway omnibuses with daily services to all districts. Connecting omnibuses are provided in conjunction with the coastal steamers.
