BERMUDA

SITUATION AND AREA

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group of about 300 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean in latitude 32° 15' N. and longitude 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730 miles, from New York 677 miles and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles.

The total area is estimated at about 21 square miles as compared with 19 square miles prior to the establishment of naval and military bases by the Government of the United States. Between 1941 and 1943 certain islands were joined and other areas, previously water covered, were filled in and now form a part of the territory occupied by the United States bases, including a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

CLIMATE

The climate has long been celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The mean annual temperature in 1948 was 71·1° F., the minimum recorded being 45° in March and the maximum 90·7° in August. The mean relative humidity was 77, the most humid months being May and June when it reached 82. The rainfall in 1948 was 59·89 inches. The summer heat is usually tempered by a pleasant sea breeze.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Bermudas, of which a good account will be found in the narrative of the voyage of the Challenger, may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sandhills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 3 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. The largest island, generally known as the main island, is about 14 miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands and areas reclaimed for the United States bases aggregate about 4,280 acres. The City of Hamilton, now the seat of government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the vessels which carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of government to Hamilton, is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as one of refuge.
The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island entirely given up for the accommodation of His Majesty’s dockyard, H.M.S. “Malabar” and other naval establishments; Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, and now exclusively occupied by naval depots and dockyard-men’s quarters and residences; Somerset, Smith’s, Nonsuch, Ports and Godets—all inhabited by a civil population.

A part of St. David’s Island is now occupied by the United States army. The islands form an almost continuous chain and there is uninterrupted communication by buses, roads, bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset, and over Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island, a distance of about 22 miles.

**Population**

The total population, excluding naval, military and air force personnel, is estimated at 35,560. English is universally spoken.

**Religion**

All denominations are fully represented throughout the colony, there being 44 places of worship, as follows:

- Church of England 16;
- Church of Scotland 1;
- Presbyterian 1;
- Wesleyan Methodist 11;
- Roman Catholic 5;
- African Methodist Episcopal 10.

There is accommodation for 13,000 persons in the various churches.

**History**

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, after whom they were called “The Bermudas.” The Spaniards, however, took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers’ ship *The Sea Venture*, while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the Admiral’s ship “The Sea Venture Flat.”

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudez, called the group after him “The Somers’ Islands.”

The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land, taken home by Somers’ nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I, but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called “The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands,” and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers.

**Constitution**

Representative government was introduced into the colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the governors have always been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, consisting of four official and three unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 3,231 electors, the electoral qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240. The members of the Executive Council and the Legislature are paid at the rate of 16s. for each day’s attendance.

With the enactment of the Women’s Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

**Administration**

Hamilton and St. George’s have been incorporated as municipalities since 1793 and 1797 respectively, and there are nine parish vestries, all the members of which, as well as the two municipal corporations, are elected annually.

The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 12s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property.

The corporation of St. George’s obtains its revenue in a like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100.

Both corporations are local boards of health in their respective districts.

The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy parish rates, a further source of income being obtained under the Liquor Licence Act, licensees paying a certain annual sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

**Social Services**

**Education**

The first legislative grant in aid of elementary education was made in 1816.

The central control is now vested in a Board of Education consisting of the Chairman and nine
members, who are appointed by the Governor under the provisions of The Schools Act, 1922.

Free elementary education was introduced on the 1st May, 1949. Before that date fees were charged in all schools, varying in amount from 6d. a week to about £30 per annum. Attendance is at present compulsory for children over seven and under thirteen years of age, but it is proposed to raise the school leaving age to 14 years as soon as the required accommodation is available. During 1948 there were 27 aided schools with a total enrolment of 5,494 pupils. In addition, there were 1,251 pupils enrolled in private schools, of whom 562 were attending one school.

In 1905, the Legislature established an annual scholarship, tenable for a period of two years (later extended to three years) at some educational institution abroad to be approved by the Governor, with a view to assisting youths to prepare themselves for the Rhodes Scholarship. The present value of this scholarship is £280 per annum.

During 1924, The Bermuda (Technical Education) Scholarship Act was passed establishing four additional scholarships tenable for four years at educational institutions abroad. The value of the scholarships, one of which is awarded every year, is £210 per annum.

Under the provisions of The Bermuda Scholarship for Girls Act, which was passed in 1939, six scholarships were established for girls. These scholarships, two of which are awarded every year, are of an annual value of £280 and are tenable for three years at approved institutions abroad.

Health

The level of health in the colony is high and is safeguarded by the General Board of Health with a director of health services, two medical officers, nurses, health inspectors, etc., to a total of about 75. There is no malaria, but mosquitoes are controlled.

In 1949 the Legislature provided £55,000 towards the maintenance of King Edward VII Hospital of 100 beds and £6,000 for the Bermuda Nursing Home of 20 beds. Further hospital accommodation is needed.

The Bermuda Welfare Society, with £2,900 from the Treasury, maintains district nurses in each parish.

Labour

The Labour Board, whose chairman is a member of the Legislature, maintains an office for the purpose of co-ordinating the supply of and demand for labour. There is existing legislation for the settlement of labour disputes and trade unions were legalised in October, 1946.

Two trade unions were registered in 1947. The "Bermuda Union of Teachers" (114 members) and the "Bermuda Industrial Union".

At March, 1949, the membership of the "Bermuda Industrial Union" was registered as being 1,222 members.

Communications

Roads

There are approximately 109 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads.

Prior to 1939, the use of motor vehicles, with the exception of those operated in connection with certain essential services, was prohibited, but during the war the necessity arose for a speed up of communications and during the war years Bermuda became conscious of the advantages to be gained by allowing the general use of motor transport. In consequence, legislation providing for the operation of motor vehicles on the highways of the colony was finally enacted in August, 1946. With certain limitations covering size, horse-power and speed, motor cars, taxis, omnibuses, lorries and auto-bicycles may now be used.

Private motor cars and taxis must not exceed the following specifications: horse-power 10, overall length 160 inches, and overall width 64 inches.

No person may use a motor car which, at the time of its importation, was second-hand. Ownership and driving of private cars is restricted to one car per household.

Annual licence fees are assessed at the rate of £2 per horse-power for private cars and taxis; £1 10s. 0d.–£2 10s. 0d. for commercial vehicles.

Omnibuses and Ferries

The "Abandonment of the Bermuda Railway" Act was passed in June, 1947, and the Railway Service was discontinued at the end of April, 1948. The Government of British Guiana have purchased the railway and omnibuses now operate a regular service throughout the Island. Between Somerset and Hamilton there is a regular ferry service which also connects Hamilton with the parishes of Paget and Warwick.

Shipping

Since February, 1949, The Furness Bermuda Line has been operating the Q.T.E.V. "Queen of Bermuda" on the New York–Bermuda route, which has been the means of bringing a large number of tourists from the United States of America to the colony. This vessel can accommodate approximately 731 passengers.

The Pacific Steam Navigation Company passenger liner, the "Reina del Pacifico", makes four calls during the year from England and also calls at Bermuda on her return trip from South America. Pacific Steam Navigation Company Freighters, "S" ships, which have accommodation for a few passengers also call at Bermuda from England approximately twice a month.

The Royal Mail Line "Loch" ships call here from England about once a month, while other cargo ships of the same line call in here approximately fortnightly.

The Canadian National Steamship Company have the S.S. "Lady Nelson" and the S.S. "Lady Rodney" which are passenger and cargo ships operating once a month between Canada and the West Indies and calling at Bermuda on both their outward and inward voyages. Other cargo vessels of this line with accommodation for a few passengers call at Bermuda from Canada approximately twice per month, and at various times call at Bermuda on their return voyage from the British West Indies.

The Alcoa S.S. Line operate approximately two cargo vessels from Canada to the West Indies which call at Bermuda on their outward journey only. There is also a freight only service by the Alcoa S.S. Company from New York calling at Bermuda about every third week.

Air

British Overseas Airways Corporation, Pan American Airways and Colonial Airlines maintain a regular service between Bermuda and the United
States of America. British South American Airways have weekly flights between Bermuda, the West Indies and South America connecting with British Overseas Airways in Bermuda. British South American Airways also operate a weekly freighter service through Bermuda between the United Kingdom and the West Indies, connecting with their South American services. Trans Canada Airlines stop at Bermuda in each direction on their weekly service from Montreal to Trinidad returning to Toronto. Trans Canada Airlines also operate a weekly service to Bermuda from Toronto returning to Montreal.

Aerovias Guest S.A. call at Bermuda on a regular service with two flights each way each week between Mexico City and Madrid via the Azores. Compania Cubanas de Aviacion operate between Havana and Madrid once a week each way calling at Bermuda and the Azores.

Postal

Letters from England usually take three days by air-mail. The average time for conveyance by surface mail is nine to twelve days.

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited

Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited operate the overseas telegraph and telephone communications systems in Bermuda.

A direct cable to Halifax, N.S., forms an undersea link with North America, and a relay point with Great Britain and the world wide network of Cable and Wireless Limited and Associated Companies.

With a southerly cable landing at Turks Island and from thence to Jamaica in one direction and Barbados in the other, the West Indies and general Caribbean area is well served.

The Wireless Transmitting Station situated at St. George's and its receiving counterpart at Store Hill, provide the community with comprehensive radio facilities.

Wireless telegraph circuits are maintained with R.C.A. and Mackay Radio systems in New York, and direct wireless telegraph circuits are available with London, Montreal, Barbados, etc., if and when required.

Direct radio telephone circuits are operated with New York and London, and through these distant terminals, long distance facilities are available with the U.S.A., Canada, the United Kingdom and many other parts of the world. A direct service with the West Indies is expected to open shortly.

Radiotelephone services are also available with the Q.T.E.V. "Queen of Bermuda" and certain liners on the North Atlantic route.

(N.B.—In connection with radio telephone services it should be borne in mind that Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited provide the overseas links only.)

A recent development of the Company's operations is the establishment of direct phototelegram (facsimile) services with New York and London.

The Company's Coast Station (VRT) provides communication with ships at sea, a radio beacon and a medium wave direction finding service available upon request.

The Company is also under contract with the Air Ministry and the Bermuda Government to provide certain radio services required in connection with the operation of the Bermuda airport and general civil aeronautical services. Included are H.F. and V.H.F. radiophone air-guard services for aircraft in flight together with aeronautical point-to-point services with Prestwick, Nassau, Jamaica, Trinidad, and a radio teletype circuit with Montreal.

The privately-owned Bermuda Telephone Company has 3,270 subscribers with about 26,500 miles of wire, a large portion of which is in underground cables. It is the terminal authority in Bermuda for the Radio Telephone services referred to above.
