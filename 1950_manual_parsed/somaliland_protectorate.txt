SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE

In 1884 a protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somal Coast, extending from Lahadu (Loyi-ada), half-way between Ras Jibuti and Zeilah, to the 49th meridian E. longitude. The boundary was settled by agreements with France, Italy and King Menelik of Ethiopia. Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden, as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, and in 1905 to that of the Colonial Office. From August, 1940–March, 1941, the protectorate was under Italian occupation. It was reoccupied in March, 1941, and was under British military administration until November 15th, 1948, when Civil Government was resumed.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION, HISTORY AND CLIMATE

The chief ports are Berbera and Zeila. Area about 68,000 square miles.

The climate at the coast is trying for Europeans, but it is comparatively healthy in the interior, where an elevation of from 4,500 feet to 6,800 feet is reached.

The Haud waterless plains, the greater part of which lie to the south of the protectorate frontier, constitute the principal pastures of the country which are essential to the livelihood of the people whose chief source of livelihood lies in their stock.

In the beginning of 1901, operations were commenced against a fanatical Somali leader, the Mullah Mohammed Abdullah, and a native levy with British officers penetrated into the Nogal valley. The Mullah was defeated at Somala and Ferdiddin, and was driven into Italian territory.

The dervishes afterwards gathered together again, and a similar expedition, strengthened by the 2nd King's African Rifles (Nyasas), was despatched in the summer of 1902, and again drove the Mullah into Italian territory with heavy loss, but met with a severe check in Italian territory at Erigo, on 6th October. The Mullah, however, retired as the result of this action still further into Italian territory, to Galadi.

Five months later a third expedition, comprising British and Boer M.I., Indian and African troops, with the main base at Obbia in Italian Somaliland, proceeded to Mudug, thence detaching a force to Galadi, which place was up till then the headquarters of the enemy. A force of 200 Nyasas and Sikhs was overwhelmed at Gumburru in April, 1903, after a fight of the fiercest description. A column of 200 men was at the same time attacked at Daratoleh, whence it retired fighting to Bohotleh. In June the expedition fell back on the Berbera-Bohotleh lines of communication, and Lieut.-General Sir C. C. Egerton, K.C.B., was placed in command.

Reinforcements, increasing the force to 7,000 rifles, were despatched and placed in the field, and in January, 1904, 3,250 troops defeated 5,000 dervishes at Jidballi.

In March, 1905, an agreement was concluded between the Italian Government and the Mullah whereby peace was declared between the dervishes and the neighbouring tribes, both those subject to the Government of Italy and those under the protection of the British Government. The Mullah was given a port on the east coast, and was assigned certain territories within the Italian sphere of interest, beyond which he and his dervishes undertook not to encroach.

In the latter part of 1908, some unrest was caused by the unfriendly attitude of the Mullah, and during 1909 reinforcements were brought into the protectorate from East Africa, Uganda, Nyasaland and India.

Subsequently arrangements were made to arm the friendly tribes to enable them to defend themselves against attack, and in March, 1910, all troops were withdrawn from the interior; the 6th Battalion King's African Rifles was disbanded, and a policy of strict coastal concentration was adopted. This policy having disappointed expectations, a Camel Constabulary, 150 strong, was raised at the end of 1912 to check inter-tribal fighting, which by this time had assumed serious proportions. A measure of peace among the friendly tribes was quickly restored, but in August, 1913, the Constabulary, at a strength of 109 rank and file, encountered at Dulmadoba a raiding party of dervishes estimated at 2,000 rifles, and in the action which
ensued, though heavy losses were inflicted on the enemy, the Constabulary sustained casualties amounting to 50 per cent. killed, including the Commandant. The force thereupon fell back on Sheikh, and reinforcements of Indian infantry were moved up from the coast. His Majesty's Government later decided to increase the forces of the protectorate in order to preserve the necessary grazing grounds of the friendlies from dervish attack, and to maintain peace among the tribes living in the west.

In November, 1914, military headquarters were established at Burao, 90 miles from the coast. At this time the dervishes were in occupation of the Ain valley, which was one of the principal grazing grounds of the friendlies. Strong forts had been constructed by the Mullah at Jidali and Shimber Berris and these were used as forward bases for raids against our tribes. The position at Shimber Berris was accordingly attacked by the local troops, and after a stubborn resistance all the forts were finally captured and blown up. In 1914, the dervishes made serious raids and their aggressions went on during the first World war, but, early in 1920, operations against them were carried out by air attacks followed up by mounted forces with infantry supports. These operations were completely successful; the power of the dervishes was destroyed, and the Mullah became a fugitive in Ethiopian territory. He died there in 1921. Between 1923 and 1940 the condition of the country was peaceful, and as a result the animal stocks of the native population largely increased, while in the western areas the development of agriculture made considerable progress. A geological survey of the Protectorate was made.

From June, 1932, to May, 1935, the officer appointed to administer the Government was designated Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief.

After the collapse of France and the entry of Italy into the war in June, 1940, it was apparent that no assistance could be expected from French Somaliland in the event of an Italian attack, which materialised on 4th August when powerful forces invaded the Protectorate from Ethiopia. In the face of overwhelming odds it was decided to evacuate the civil government, and this was completed by 18th August.

The Italian occupation was short-lived. The forces under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Alan Cunningham in their advance from Kenya had broken Italian resistance in Somalia by the end of February, 1941, and by March were driving northwards in pursuit of the Italian forces, leaving Somaliland Protectorate on the right flank of their advance. On 16th March, 1941, an expeditionary force which had been concentrated at Aden, re-occupied the Protectorate and came under control of Sir Alan Cunningham. Brigadier A. R. Chater, C.B., D.S.O., O.B.E., was appointed Military Governor on the 9th April, 1941. The Protectorate remained under military administration until the 15th November, 1948, when the Civil Protectorate Government was re-constituted. From this time the Protectorate has been under civil administration with the seat of government at Hargeisa.

**POPULATION**

No complete census has been taken, but the Somaliland population was estimated in 1937 at 344,700. This figure has probably doubled itself since then. No figures of non-natives are available. The native population is almost entirely nomadic and periodic migration across the southern border into Ethiopia in search of grazing is a regular practice amongst many tribes and sections.

**RELIGION**

In religion, the Somali are Sunni Mohammedans. The people in the interior are not very strict in their religious observances. On the coast the people are more strict, probably owing partly to their being less nomadic than those of the interior, and also by reason of their intercourse with Arabia.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Constitution of the Somaliland Protectorate rests on the Somaliland Order in Council, 1929, as amended by the Somaliland Orders in Council, 1930, 1932, 1935, 1938, 1941, 1946 and 1948. There is no executive or legislative council, and the power of making ordinances is vested in the Governor, subject to the general and specific instructions of the Secretary of State.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The Protectorate is divided into six districts, each under the charge of a British district officer. The absence of any cohesion amongst the tribes themselves and their nomadic habits makes any form of administration through native authorities a matter of considerable difficulty. Where such authorities exist, all possible use is made of them but, for the most part, paid Government native agents known as "Akils" are employed.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

With the re-occupation of the Protectorate in 1941 it became necessary to make an entirely fresh start with health and education services. Hospital accommodation is now available or in the course of construction at the main centres of population and a dispensary service is contemplated to provide for the needs of the nomadic tribesmen. Progress has been made in the development of clinics for women and children.

Education, unpopular before the war, is now progressing and five Government schools are in operation, together with a boarding and elementary school at Sheikh, which also offers facilities for technical and adult training. There are a considerable number of Koran schools which receive grants from the Government.

The nomadic characteristics of the Somali tribes make little in the way of labour services possible.

A sum of £750,000 was allocated to the Protectorate for Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes. This sum is to be spent over ten years ending the 31st March, 1956.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There are no railways or waterways, but some 2,500 miles of road are open for wheeled traffic in the dry season. There is also a fairly considerable traffic, chiefly by dhow along the coast of Somaliland across to Aden and southern Arabia. There is a weekly steamship service between Berbera and Aden operated by Messrs. Cowasjee, Dinshaw & Brothers.

A weekly air service in both directions between Cairo, Asmara, Aden, Hargeisa, Mogadiscio and Nairobi connects the Protectorate with all main trunk air services.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Two units of currency are in force—the Indian rupee and the East African shilling. In each case subsidiary coinage and notes are in circulation. The introduction of the East African shilling arises from the expulsion of the Italians from East Africa and the fact that until 15th November, 1948, the Protectorate was included with other Somali Territories under unified Military Administration.

There are no banks in the Protectorate, but Messrs Cowasjee, Dinshaw & Brothers, conduct some banking business.
