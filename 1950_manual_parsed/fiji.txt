FIJI

SITUATION AND AREA

The colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 21° S., and between longitude 178° W. and 176° E. It is distant from Sydney 1,743 miles, and from Auckland 1,148 miles. The Tonga or Friendly Islands lie 420 miles to the south-east of Suva, and Samoa 645 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. There are about 250 islands in the group; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotuma consists of all islands, rocks and reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,011 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,137 square miles, Taveuni, 168 square miles, Kandavu, 158 square miles, Koro, 40 square miles, Ngau, 54 square miles, and Ovalau, 40 square miles. The total area of the colony (including Rotuma, 18 square miles) is approximately 7,040 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

CLIMATE

The climate of Fiji is oceanic. The south-east trade-wind blows from May to November and during the remaining months the direction of the wind is variable. Between December and April when hot northerly winds blow from the equator the temperature may rise to 92° and the humidity may reach saturation point. The total average annual rainfall varies in the well-defined "wet" and "dry" zones from 60 to 140 inches and the temperature varies from a minimum of 59° to a maximum of 96°, though for some years now it has not exceeded 92°.

There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The highest temperature at Suva in 1948 was 92·0° on 14th January, and the lowest 61·9° on 15th May. The total rainfall was 141·10 inches, and the average annual rainfall 120·86 inches. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising, in many places, more or less abruptly from the shore. The highest point in the Colony is Mount Victoria (4,341 feet) in Viti Levu. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and were probably mostly under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger islands, i.e., the leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills and plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Gold is produced from the Tavua and Vunda districts in the north and north-western sections of
Viti Levu Island; prospecting activities are in progress in these and other localities. The gold is generally associated with flow-rocks of Tertiary age or their tuffaceous equivalents. It occurs in the free condition, associated with sulphides, and as telluride. Base metal ores, carrying low precious-metal values, are known to occur in various parts of the colony, but production has not yet resulted therefrom. The mining industry occupies second place in the industries of the colony. In 1948, 118,536 fine ounces of gold valued at £F1,012,324 and 37,920 fine ounces of silver valued at £F6,926 were exported.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed launches, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Singatoka, the Nandi, and Mba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The largest river, the Ndreketi, is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "ndalo" or taro (Colocasia antiquorum).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

The principal island of the Rotuma group is approximately nine miles long by three miles broad and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore are three islets, Hatana, Hofliua and Uea. None of these is now inhabited, although people visit them occasionally to cut copra or to collect seabirds' eggs.

**Population**

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. A census was taken on 3rd October, 1946. The estimated population at 31st October, 1948, was:

|                  | Males | Females | Total |
|------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Europeans        | 3,481 | 2,678   | 6,159 |
| Part-Europeans   | 3,385 | 3,145   | 6,530 |
| Fijians          | 62,875| 61,120  | 123,995|
| Polynesians, Melanesians, Micronesians | 2,343 | 1,667 | 4,010 |
| Indians          | 69,525| 60,236  | 129,761|
| Rotumans         | 1,779 | 1,708   | 3,487 |
| Chinese          | 1,978 | 826     | 2,804 |
| Others           | 343   | 283     | 626   |
| **Total**        | **145,709** | **131,663** | **277,372** |

The European population of Suva and its suburbs at the October, 1946 census was 2,266.

The births among the Fijian population in 1948 totalled 4,512, and the deaths 1,798. The birth rate was 36·39 and the death rate 14·50 per mil.

**Religion**

The European and Fijian population is predominantly Christian. Most of the Indians in the colony are Hindus, but there are Muslim and Christian minorities.

The numerically strongest Christian denomination is the Methodist. The Roman Catholic and Seventh Day Adventist missions have established stations throughout the colony. The Roman Catholic Mission was made a bishopric in 1887. Suva is the centre of the Anglican diocese of Polynesia, and the site of a pro-cathedral. There are Anglican churches at Levuka, Lautoka and Lambassa. A station for Solomon islanders living in Fiji has been established at Walloku.

There is a Presbyterian church in Suva.

The 1946 census revealed the following figures of adherents to the undermentioned Christian denominations:

- Church of England: 3,832
- Methodist: 109,944
- Presbyterian: 736
- Roman Catholic: 18,920
- Seventh Day Adventists: 2,339

Of the Indian population at that date, 99,404 were Hindus and 16,932 were Mohammedan.

**History**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1774. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1858, Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Europeans set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a parliament elected. The parliament and the government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the ministry latterly governed without the aid of the parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in 1873 the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, in 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in 1874 to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the chief of Mbau, Maafu, who was chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taveuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession.
dated 10th October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, which has a fine harbour.

Rotuma was discovered by the Pandora in 1793, and named Granville Island. In 1879 the three principal Rotuman chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain and they were annexed 13th May, 1881.

**CONSTITUTION**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd April, 1937. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Financial Secretary, together with two other officials and four unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

When a vacancy occurs amongst the unofficial members of Executive Council the unofficial members of Legislative Council may recommend one of their number to fill the vacancy. There are European, Fijian and Indian members of Executive Council.

Under the Letters Patent, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, three *ex officio* members (official), not more than 13 nominated official members, five European members (three elected and two nominated), five native nominated members and five Indian members (three elected and two nominated).

**ADMINISTRATION**

Fiji is divided into four administrative districts, under the control of District Commissioners, who have one or more District Officers to assist them. Headquarters are at Suva in the Southern and Eastern District, Lautoka in the Western District, Lambasa in the Northern District.

Each administrative district contains a number of Fijian provinces, of which there are 14 altogether in the colony. A District Commissioner represents the Secretary for Fijian Affairs in matters connected with Fijian administration within his District.

Suva, the capital of Fiji, is controlled by a Town Council, constituted under the Local Government (Towns) Ordinance, 1947, having three European councillors elected by the European electors, three Indian councillors elected by the Indian electors and two councillors appointed by the Governor.

Lautoka, the main centre of the Western District is controlled by a Town Board constituted under the Towns Ordinance, 1935, and has two official and six unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

Levuka, the old capital of Fiji, is controlled by a Township Board, which, together with the Boards for the townships of Nausori, Mba, Lambasa and Nandi, is constituted under the Townships Ordinance which provides for the nomination by the Governor of both official and unofficial members.

The Fijians retain a large share of self-government. Their system of district and provincial councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by annual meetings of the high chiefs and other representatives of each province. The Council of Chiefs makes recommendations on Fijian affairs, and bills affecting Fijians may be referred to this council for consideration before being submitted to the Legislative Council.

There is a Fijian Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs (chairman), the five Fijian members of Legislative Council, and a legal adviser. The Board submits to the Governor recommendations and proposals for the benefit of the Fijian people and considers questions relating to their good government and well-being referred to it by the Governor. It has the power to make regulations providing for the peace, order and good government of Fijians, for communal services, the provision of public services and the imposition of rates, for sanitation and fishing and regarding the jurisdiction, powers and procedure of Fijian Courts and magistrates civil and criminal cases. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council, but provisional approval may be granted by the Secretary for Fijian Affairs. The Board is the controlling financial authority in Fijian administration and has power to regulate the conditions of employment of persons in its service. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs is the executive officer of Fijian local government. He is directly responsible to the Governor and, in appropriate matters, to the Legislative Council for the good government of the Fijians as a whole.

In Rotuma, where the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, a District Officer is the chief executive authority. The District Officer is *ex officio* a magistrate with powers to hold magistrates courts of the second class, and may take evidence in indictable cases for transmission to the Supreme Court.

The main island is divided into seven districts over each of which is a chief appointed by the Governor, and is administered by the district officer with the assistance of a Council of Chiefs, held monthly. The Council, an advisory body, consists of the District Officer (chairman), the seven district chiefs, the native medical practitioner, one teacher, and one representative from each district.

A Rotuma Regulation Board, consisting of the District Officer and between five and ten Rotumans makes regulations relating to the good government and well-being of the natives. All such regulations are subject to approval by the Legislative Council of Fiji.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

The Education Ordinance (Cap. 103), passed in 1929, constituted the Department of Education, and established the Board of Education, consisting of the Director of Education and not more than eight other members nominated by the Governor. The ordinance gives very wide powers to the Board to control all phases of education. The most important are the registering of schools and teachers, the allocation of grants-in-aid and the determination of the instruction to be given.

The Education Rating Ordinance (Cap. 104) authorises the levying of a special rate in the education districts of Suva and Levuka to meet one-half of the net cost incurred by the Government in maintaining European schools within the limits of the districts.

There are two grammar schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, and a public school in Levuka for boys and girls, all under Government control and with hostels attached. The roll number during 1949 at the two grammar schools was 633, and at the Levuka public school 239 (boys and girls).
The Queen Victoria Memorial School provides for the higher education of Fijians, and is maintained from public revenue; the school is at present in temporary quarters, its buildings having been requisitioned during the war for a military hospital; but a most attractive new coastal site has been selected, and building has commenced.

A secondary school for Indians (mainly boys) is maintained from public funds near Lautoka.

Schools for primary education may be conducted by any properly constituted and approved authority or by Government. Six provincial schools established by the Government over 20 years ago serve as boarding schools for Fijians. These schools are consolidated in a large intermediate boarding school at Londoni on the eastern coast of Viti Levu. An intermediate school for Fijian girls has also been established.

A technical school for all races is maintained at Suva and a similar school has been constructed at Levuka and is in operation.

In 1949 there were 448 schools in the colony, including 287 Fijian registered and recognised schools, with an average enrolment of 24,614, and 118 registered and recognised schools for Indians, with an average enrolment of 17,782.

Teacher training in the Colony is conducted at a Government Teachers' Training College with a roll of 254 students, Fijians and Indians of both sexes.

Information Services

The Public Relations Office performs the triple task of telling the people of Fiji about Government proposals and achievements, providing news about Fiji for use overseas, and passing on to the people of the colony information about British Commonwealth affairs. It is the channel through which all official statements pass to the press and the local broadcasting station.

The Public Relations Office provides local broadcast and telegraphed news services in English and prepares and presents programmes of entertainment, news, and general information, to Fijian and Indian listeners in Fijian and Hindustani respectively. Its staff edits Na Mata, the Government newspaper for Fijians.

A weekly cyclostyled bulletin, "News from Fiji", is sent to overseas information departments; newspapers and news agencies. A printed pamphlet, "Fiji Information", is published quarterly.

A photographic section supplies photographs for use in local and overseas publicity and prints are available for sale in Fiji.

Close liaison is maintained with the unofficial Fiji Publicity Board and Tourist Bureau, which gives advice and help to tourists and visitors to the Colony.

Health

The Central Medical School in Suva, which has a teaching staff of one whole-time medical officer, who is the principal, an assistant principal and 14 honorary lecturers, was founded in 1884 for the training of Fijian youths; but since 1928 its benefits have been available to other Western Pacific territories, and its graduates, now numbering 296, include Fijians, Fiji Indians, Western Samoans, Eastern Samoans, Tongans, Gilbertese, Ellice Islanders, Solomon Islanders, New Hebrideans, Rotumans, Nauruans, Cook Islanders and Nieu Islanders. Construction of a larger central medical school and hostel to accommodate 70 students is to start during 1949.

From this school are sent out native assistant medical practitioners who work among their own people, not only treating the sick and attending to native health conditions in the villages, but also forming a bridge for the conveyance of European medical thought to the native mind: a system which has been responsible more than any other single factor for winning the confidence of the Fijians in modern medicine and surgery.

In several of the provinces, hospitals and dispensaries for the use of Fijians and others have been opened and in each of these is an assistant medical practitioner either in sole charge or acting as house surgeon under the European medical officer. In addition, there are well-equipped general hospitals for all races at Suva, Lautoka, Levuka and Lambasa. The military hospital at Tamavua was converted into a tuberculosis hospital in 1946 with 170 beds with room for expansion. There is a public mental hospital in Suva, and on the island of Makongai a colony for the segregation and treatment of those afflicted with leprosy.

All these institutions are owned and maintained by the Government. The hospital at Makongai deserves special mention, as it has achieved world fame because of its success in the treatment of leprosy. The nursing system there, the personnel of which is drawn from the Roman Catholic Order of Mary, is of outstanding merit. The average number of patients is 680. Other territories in the South West Pacific contribute towards the cost of the maintenance of patients admitted from their territories.

In 1923, with the assistance of £20,500 subscribed by the public, the Colonial War Memorial Hospital was erected on a commanding site within the town boundaries of Suva. It is controlled by Government and staffed with four resident medical officers and an adequate number of trained and pupil nurses. It now accommodates 274 patients of all races under the care of Government Medical and Surgical Specialists and their assistants. Its equipment and general facilities conform with the standards of modern general hospitals in other countries.

A teaching branch of the Colonial War Memorial Hospital which is of ever-growing importance is its school for training of non-European nurses in general nursing, obstetrics and public health nursing. The number of pupil nurses has been increased to 100 and a principal and one tutor-sister undertake a large portion of the teaching, working directly under the supervision of the matron and nursing superintendent. Construction of a new nurses' training school and hostel of modern design is expected to start in 1949. The Colonial War Memorial Hospital, Tamavua Hospital and the Suva Health Office are available as a post-graduate centre not only for nurses trained in Fiji but for non-European nurses trained in other Western Pacific territories and for graduates of the Central Medical School.

Lautoka Hospital with 112 beds is another school for non-European nurses and here 50 pupil nurses are in training. A tutor-sister has been appointed to take charge, and the curriculum is identical to that at the Colonial War Memorial Central Nursing School, Suva.

Owing to the high death-rate among Fijian infants and young children, the Government instituted in 1927 a special infant welfare organisation. It is based on putting as much responsibility as possible into the hands of the natives,
and has proved most successful. Since its inception there has been a steady decline in the infant mortality rate of the Fijian people. The work of the trained staff, which is both European and native, is greatly helped by a system under which, in almost every village, women volunteer workers are appointed to take care of the children of that village.

In recent years a special mosquito control branch of the Medical Department has been established. Its first task was to undertake clearing and drainage work in the vicinity of ports and airfields so as to lessen the danger of the introduction of the *anopheles* mosquito from the malarial areas to the north of Fiji, with which there was a great increase of air and sea traffic during the war. A campaign to eradicate the local filaria-carrying mosquito is in operation.

**Labour**

The Labour Department is in charge of labour welfare and derives its status and authority from the Labour Ordinance, 1947. The executive staff consists of the Commissioner of Labour, one labour officer and five labour inspectors. The department carries out the usual functions of labour departments in the colonies, including the promotion of harmony in industrial relations and the safeguarding of the general welfare of workers. The question of old age pensions is under consideration, and meantime destitution is dealt with by assistance from public funds. The Industrial Associations Ordinance (Cap. 79) and the Industrial Disputes (Conciliation and Arbitration) Ordinance (Cap. 80), provide machinery for collective bargaining. The Workmen's Compensation Ordinance (Cap. 81) compensates for accidents throughout industry, including workers in agricultural employment. Compensation for occupational diseases is also provided. Factory legislation is under consideration.

Numerous Labour Conventions have been given statutory force in the Labour Ordinance, 1947, including:

- Minimum age for admission of children to industrial employment.
- Night work of young persons.
- Minimum age for children employed at sea.
- Rights of association and combination of agricultural workers.
- Workmen's compensation in agriculture.
- Minimum age for the admission of young persons to employment as trimmers and stokers.
- Compulsory medical examination of young persons employed at sea.
- Equality of treatment for national and foreign workers as regards workmen's compensation for accidents.
- Workmen's compensation for occupational diseases.
- Employment of women in underground work in mines.
- The regulation of certain special systems of recruiting workers.
- Written contracts of employment of indigenous workers.
- Penal sanctions for breaches of contract of employment by indigenous workers.
- Forced or compulsory labour.
- Employment of women during the night.

The colony has accepted the recommendations of the 1944 and 1945 International Labour Conferences regarding minimum standards of social policy in dependent territories, and the Labour Ordinance, 1947, takes the necessary powers.

Further information may be found in the annual report of the Commissioner of Labour.

**Communications**

**Roads and Tramways**

There is no railway in the colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. owns various tramlines connecting with estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. On Viti Levu a circular all-weather motor road 323 miles long connects Suva with Tailevu, Tavua, Mba, Lau-toka, Nandi, Sigatoka and Navua. Branch roads afford access to other centres of settlement, including the mining area of Vatukoula and the hill station at Nandarivatu.

There are 19 miles of road on Ovalau and 40 miles on Taveuni.

On the island of Vanua Levu there are two disconnected road systems, one following the coast for 30 miles from Savusavu and the other connecting Lambasa with settlements in the vicinity.

**Shipping**

There is a direct cargo service from the United Kingdom.

There is a regular steamship communication with Australia, New Zealand, Canada and U.S.A. Inter-island communication is maintained by regular steamer or cutter services.

Suva is a port of registry under the Merchant Shipping Act.

The number of local vessels trading within the colony and holding sea-going certificates from the Marine Board during 1948 was:

| Owned by | No. | Tons |
|----------|-----|------|
| Europeans | .. | 49 | 1,686 |
| Natives | .. | 10 | 152 |
| Others | .. | 25 | 415 |

Total | 84 | 2,253 |

The number of merchant vessels entered from overseas at the three ports of entry in the colony during the year 1948 was 168, the total registered tonnage being 546,993.

**Air**

There are two airfields on Viti Levu, one near Nandi on the west coast and the other at Nausori, 13 miles from Suva. There is a seaplane base at Lautala Bay, close to Suva. There are air services between Fiji and New Zealand, Australia, Tonga, Western Samoa, Cook Islands and the New Hebrides, but time-tables are subject to variation. Trans-Pacific air services make regular calls at Fiji.

The numbers of aircraft entered in from overseas during the year were:

| British | Foreign | Total |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Laucala Bay | .. | 80 | 80 |
| Nadi | .. | 244 | 414 |
| Nausori | .. | 27 | 27 |
| Total | .. | 351 | 414 |

**Postal and Telegraphs**

Overseas surface mails are despatched via New Zealand every twenty-eight days, and once every two months by the Canadian-Australian vessel "Aorangi" to Hawaii, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The services of vessels calling irregularly are also used.

Air mails are despatched to New Zealand, Canada, and the United States once weekly and to Australia twice weekly. Samoa, Tonga and certain other island groups are served fortnightly by air.
Air mails for Great Britain, Europe, all Empire countries, India and Pakistan are forwarded via Australia.

Agreements are in force for the exchange of parcels with the United States and Pakistan, for the exchange of money orders and parcels with Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and Tonga, and for money orders only with the British Solomon Islands Protectorate and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.

Imperial postal orders are issued and paid at Suva and four other post offices.

Telephone Exchanges are in operation at Suva, Nausori, Navua, Nadroga, Nadi, Lautoka, Ba, Vatukoula, Tavua and Rakiraki which are linked by a trunk with Suva. Exchanges are also in operation at Levuka on Ovalau and Lambasa on Vanua Levu.

Overseas cables are maintained by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., and wireless communications by Amalgamated Wireless (Aust.), Ltd.

The internal telegraph service is maintained by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Communication is by wireless between Suva, Levuka, Makogai, Lambasa, Waiyemo, Savusavu, Nabouwalu, Lakeba, Lomaloma and Kadavu. Land line offices are situated at all telephone exchanges on Viti Levu and also at Korovou and Vunidawasa.

Radio telephony equipment has been installed at a number of the existing wireless stations and by the end of the year 1949, 12 stations were in operation, and though direct speech was restricted to official requirements, the stations were available to the public for the transmission of telegrams. A further 9 stations will be brought into operation in 1950 and it is hoped that they will all then be available for direct speech for public as well as administrative purposes.

**Public Finance**

The Public Debt of the Colony comprises the following loans of which the last two were raised locally.

| Loan                        | Amount (£) |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| 5% Public Purposes Loan     | 1955       |
| 4% Public Works Loan        | 1959       |
| 3% Public Works Loan        | 1960–70    |
| 2½% Fiji War Loan           | 1951–53    |
| 3¼% Redemption Loan         | 1966–71    |

The whole of the proceeds of the 2½ per cent. War Loan were re-lent to his Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom for expenditure on Imperial defence.

A comparison of the Assets and Liabilities of the Colony for the year 1946, 1947 and 1948 is as follows:

| Year | Assets (£) | Liabilities (£) |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1946 | 3,150,480 | 2,163,005       |
| 1947 | 3,643,412 | 2,270,359       |
| 1948 | 4,486,460 | 2,698,306       |

The main heads of taxation and the yield from each during the year 1947 were as follows: Customs Duties including Import Duties, Port and Customs Service Tax, Wharfage Light and Tonnage Duties, £F1,436,313; Income Tax, £F800,057; Licences, £F68,400; Residential Tax, £F46,119; Entertainment Tax, £F8,489; Stamp Duties, £F9,911; Death and Gift Duties, £F15,694.

Customs duties account for just over half of the Revenue of the Colony and practically all imports are taxed.

The Customs tariff is, in general, on an ad-valorem basis, and, until the end of 1947 duty was assessed on the value of goods at the port of shipment; practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British Empire material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the value of the goods and that the final processes of manufacture are performed within the British Empire. A few special items require 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. Empire content. At the end of 1947 the Port and Customs Service Tax at the rate of 6 per cent. on all imports was abolished and the basis of assessment of customs duty on imported goods at the port of origin altered to c.i.f. values at the port of landing. The Port and Customs Service Tax on exports at the rate of 1 per cent. remains and an additional export tax of 10s. a ton on sugar is also collected. In November, 1948, the duties on certain imported foodstuffs of Empire origin were removed, also most of those on machinery of Empire origin required for developing primary industries. The duties on similar foodstuffs and machinery of foreign origin have been reduced proportionately.

The main heads of expenditure in 1948 were as follows: Charges on account of Public Debt, £F88,393; Pensions, Gratuities and Compassionate allowances, £100,552; Departmental annually recurrent expenditure, £F1,754,979; Works annually recurrent, £F280,045; Works Extraordinary, £F87,861; expenditure from Surplus Balances, £F150,206.

**Public Revenue and Expenditure**

**Currency and Banking**

Legislation in 1933 and 1934 provided for the issue of Government currency notes and coin which follow the United Kingdom currency denominations.

The Fiji pound is linked to sterling by law at the fixed rate of £F111 = £100 sterling.

The circulation at 31st December, 1948, was:

- Notes: £F2,764,126
- Coin: £F251,392

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva and Lautoka, and four agencies; the Bank of New Zealand has a branch at Suva.

A Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908.

The Head Office of the Bank is in Suva and there are 23 branches. Depositors total, 40,239, and the balance to their credit on 31st December, 1948, was £F1,325,231.
Industries, Trade and Customs

The trade and commerce of the colony depend on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture and export of sugar; (2) the mining of gold; and (3) the cultivation, manufacture and export of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut).

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported.

Exports of the produce of the Colony in 1948 totalled £F7,372,295. The principal exports were sugar, gold and copra. The quantities and value exported in 1948 were:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Sugar    | 149,494 tons | 4,265,406 £F |
| Gold     | 105,712 ounces | 1,011,225 £F |
| Copra    | 21,352 tons | 992,234 £F |

The other principal exports were:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Coconut oil | 9,053 tons | 760,774 £F |
| Bananas   | 289,371 bunches | 94,996 £F |
| Biscuits  | 870,626 lb. | 34,960 £F |
| Molasses  | 25,402 tons | 25,402 £F |
| Canned pineapple | 930,186 lb. | 30,909 £F |
| Hides     | 9,759 number | 12,601 £F |
| Beche-de-mer | 34,020 lb. | 3,423 £F |
| Silver    | 40,222 ounces | 8,389 £F |
| Trocas shell | 124 tons | 7,177 £F |

Dairying is an established industry and there are factories for the manufacture of soap and biscuits. The latter supply a considerable proportion of local requirements and also an increasing proportion of the requirements of neighbouring Pacific Islands.

There are also two mills for the production of coconut oil and other by-products of copra such as coconut meal and one mill for the production of candlenut oil. The quantity of candlenut oil produced so far has not been much more than sufficient to meet local demands but the owners of the mill expect to be in a position to export in the near future. Candlenut oil is used as a substitute for linseed oil in the mixing of paints.

The customs tariff is, in general, on an ad valorem basis, duty being assessed on the value of goods at the port of shipment. Practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British Empire material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the value of the goods, and that the final processes of manufacture are performed within the British Empire. A few special items require 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. Empire content.

The total trade of the Colony in 1948 was £F13,734,346, an amount which exceeded by £F2,475,158 the figure for 1947, the previous best year on record.
