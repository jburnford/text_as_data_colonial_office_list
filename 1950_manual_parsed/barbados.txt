**BARBADOS**

**SITUATION AND AREA**

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' N. and longitude 59° 37' W., and is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

**CLIMATE**

Owing to the easterly trade winds which blow almost continuously from December to June the climate is bracing and the heat is never oppressive. During the remainder of the year, the wet season for the island, the heat is seldom excessive although the absence of the trade winds renders the climate less invigorating. The average temperature is 79-8° F.

Though the island is small there is considerable variation in rainfall: in the high central areas the average rainfall is 75 inches while in some of the low lying districts in the south of the island it is no more than 50 inches.

The island is largely visited as a health resort by residents of neighbouring West Indian colonies and British Guiana and is a popular winter resort for visitors from temperate climates. It is also a port of call for tourist steamers.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The land rises in terraces from the coast to a ridge near the centre of the island, the highest point being Mt. Hillaby (1,100 feet). The main characteristic of the island is the intense sugar cultivation; all available land is utilised and, due to the almost complete absence of forest and waste land, the general appearance is reminiscent of the English countryside. In the north-west—the Scotland district—the watershed is nearer to the coast and the descent to the sea is consequently steeper. The scenery, too, is more rugged and picturesque, and there is some erosion.

With the exception of the Scotland district, which is of volcanic origin, the island is of coral formation. Coral limestone covers the greater part of the island and coral reefs, which in some parts extend more than two miles out to sea, almost encircle it. The soils overlying the coral limestone, although divided into several types, are all suitable for good sugar cane cultivation, though heavy application of artificial manures is necessary to maintain fertility.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the south-west of the island on Carlisle Bay. This bay is an open roadstead sheltered from the prevailing winds and is available for all classes of vessels. There is in addition an inner harbour or careenage where schooners and vessels of lighter tonnage are moored.

The island is fortunate in having excellent bathing, though on the windward coast the sea is apt to be rough.

POPULATION

The population of the island in 1851 was 135,939. Thereafter a census was taken in every tenth year, except 1901, until 1921. There was no census in 1931 or 1941 but there was one in 1946. The population increased steadily between 1851 and 1891 in which year it was returned as 182,306. In 1911 the census figure was 171,983, in 1921 it was 156,512 and in 1946, 192,841. This increase is attributable to cessation of emigration to America, Cuba and Panama in the early twenties, decrease in the death rate and continued high birth rate.

The population consists of persons of African descent, persons of European descent and persons of mixed African and European descent. In 1921 persons of European descent represented 6·7 per cent. of the population; the percentage today is 5·1 per cent.

English is spoken universally.

RELIGION

The population is almost wholly Christian, and the Anglican Church, the membership of which comprises approximately 70 per cent. of the population, is the established church. The Anglican clergy receive their salaries from Government funds and are eligible for pensions under the Pension Act. The maintenance and repair of churches and church property is the responsibility of the vestries, which are authorised to lay rates for the purpose.

Next in size after the Anglican Church are the Methodist and Moravian Churches, both of which have been long established in the island. The number of Roman Catholics is comparatively small. In addition to these there are branches of the Salvation Army and of many denominations of modern growth.

HISTORY

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who found it uninhabited and rude in appearance, and named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig trees. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive Blossom in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some 30 persons, landed on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their Governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Caribbean Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of £300. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 64 settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island: and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and, under certain conditions, the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in the possession of Great Britain.

CONSTITUTION

The colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Secretary of State for the Colonies retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is nominated by the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of the Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of 15 members appointed by His Majesty, and a House of Assembly, consisting of 24 members (two for each parish and two for the City of Bridgetown) elected
for a period of two years. In 1944 the income qualification for voters was reduced from £50 to £20 a year, and the franchise was given to females who also became eligible for election as members. The number of registered electors in 1948 was 29,443 as compared with 7,394 in 1943. The executive part of the Government is vested in the Governor and an Executive Council and, in respect of certain matters, an Executive Committee. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary and Attorney General ex officio, and of such other persons as His Majesty may appoint. The Executive Committee, which is created by local statute, consists of the Executive Council ex officio and of one member of the Legislative Council and four members of the House of Assembly appointed by the Governor at the commencement of each session of the Legislature. The Executive Committee introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates and initiates all Government measures; it is also responsible for the conduct of public works, and the control and management of Government property. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada and Tobago, but in 1885, by Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands and made a distinct Government.

**Administration**

The island is administered as one unit except in respect of local government matters, which are in the hands of the vestries and parochial boards of the 11 parishes. The vestries are elected annually, and each vestry appoints commissioners of highways, commissioners of health and poor law guardians for the parish. The two last-named bodies rely for revenue upon grants from the vestry, but the commissioners of highways, who are responsible for the upkeep of all public highways in the parish which are not maintained by the Central Government, collect all vehicle and highway taxes and in addition receive grants-in-aid from the Central Government. The vestries derive their revenue mainly from taxes on ownership and occupancy of land and houses and trade tax; the rates for these are fixed annually so as to bring in sufficient revenue to meet the estimated expenditure for the year. The vestries undertake the repair and maintenance of churches and church buildings and the rector of each parish is chairman of the vestry ex officio.

**Social Services**

**Education.**

In 1943 the direction of education was transferred from a statutory board to a Director of Education. The latter has an Advisory Board of five members appointed by the Governor.

Though there is not compulsory education, any child between the ages of 5 and 14 may attend a public elementary school free of charge. There are 124 such schools, staffed by Government teachers. At the end of March, 1949, there were 29,756 children on the roll (15,223 boys and 14,533 girls) and the average attendance was 22,242.

Secondary education is provided in all state-aided schools and in a few private schools. The state-aided secondary schools receive annual grants from the Government and are managed by governing bodies, the powers and duties of which are defined in schemes framed by the Director of Education and approved by the Legislature. The schools are divided into three first grade schools (two boys' and one girls' and eight second grade schools (four boys', three girls' and one co-educational). The former prepare candidates for the school certificate and higher certificate, the latter only for the school certificate. The only secondary schools with boarding accommodation are the Lodge School, one of the first grade boys' schools, and Codrington High School, a private girls' school.

Codrington College, founded under the will of Sir Christopher Codrington at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was affiliated to Durham University in 1875 and awards the degree of the University. It is under the administration of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, who are the trustees of the founder's will. In 1949 there were 25 undergraduates in residence. All were studying either classics or theology.

The Government spends about $1,200,000 per annum on education. This includes one scholarship awarded annually, and tenable for at least three years at Oxford or Cambridge University; two scholarships annually at Codrington College, and one scholarship offered biennially and two exhibitions entailing the remission of fees at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad.

A Teacher's Training College was opened in 1948 to train elementary school teachers. Sixteen men and 16 women are in residence annually.

**Health**

Public health administration is the responsibility of the General Board of Health and of the Commissioners of Health of the 11 parishes. The Government Chief Medical Officer is a member ex officio of the General Board of Health, which has a general power to make rules and regulations for promoting the health of the inhabitants of the island, but has no direct control over the parochial Commissioners of Health. Each parish maintains its own almshouse and employs a parochial medical officer.

The only general hospital is the Barbados General Hospital, which has accommodation for 30 paying patients and 256 non-paying patients. The hospital is administered by the Government.

The Government maintains a mental hospital (accommodation for 248 males and 326 females) and a leper hospital, of which the number of inmates at the end of December, 1948, was 36.

A Government Maternity Hospital with 20 beds has been opened for the training of pupil midwives in an effort to reduce the high infant mortality rate. Accommodation has been found for twenty students who take courses of one year or eighteen months depending on their previous nursing training.

Recently, however, the Legislature has passed an Act establishing a Department of Medical Services with a Director of Medical Services at its head. Under the terms of the Act the Director shall be responsible for all matters affecting the public health and medical services of the island, and shall have general superintendence and direction of the public services of the island and of such Government institutions and establishments as the Governor may from time to time direct. The Director shall also visit and inspect all infirmaries, homes, almshouses and hospital in the island. This Act will come into effect on such day as His Excellency the Governor may appoint.
Labour

The Labour Department was established in 1940. The principles of collective bargaining introduced with the establishment of the Department continued to be instrumental in bringing about improved relations in industry.

Seven organisations—four workers' and three employers'—remained registered under the Trade Union Act, 1939. The Barbados Overseers' Association, an employees' organisation, was, however, completely inactive. The other six organisations continued to function with success. The Barbados Workers' Union, by far the largest and most representative union continued to maintain its membership of over 10,000 workers covering twenty-two active trade divisions. Considerable work was done by this Union, particularly in negotiating with the Shipping and Mercantile Association which comprises the most prominent business concerns of the city. To a lesser extent negotiations were also carried on by this Union with the Sugar Producers' Federation which embraces in its membership the management of about four-fifths of the total acreage occupied by sugar estates, twenty-three of the twenty-four D.C. Sugar factories, and nine of the thirteen syrup plants. The Congress Trade Union with its four divisions continued to operate among agricultural labourers and hotel workers, and together with the Barbados Workers' Union, was concerned in the fixing of wages in the sugar industry for the 1947-48 crop. The Clerks' Union, representing the clerks and shop assistants in Bridgetown, continued to negotiate direct with employers. The Bus Owners' Association was particularly active during the period under review.

The last nine years have seen the enactment of considerable legislation relating to labour; among the more important measures are acts dealing with the recruiting of workers, trade disputes, trade unions, workmen's compensation, wages boards and the hours and conditions of employment of shop assistants.

Between June, 1941, and December, 1948, 15,446 workers left the colony on temporary emigration schemes sponsored by the labour department; the majority went to the U.S.A. to work in industry and agriculture, and the amounts which they saved from their earnings have improved the social and economic condition of a large number of families. The return of U.S.A. nationals to American industry did away with the pressing need for immigrant workers and this, together with the discharge of men from the armed forces, aggravated the local unemployment position which at the end of 1948 was again beginning to give cause for concern.

Welfare

In 1943 the Government created the posts of Social Welfare Officer and Assistant Social Welfare Officer.

There are also a number of other voluntary bodies working in the social welfare field.

(Note.—Further particulars of these services will be found in the Annual Departmental Reports.)

Communications

Roads and Road Transport

The office of Director of Highways and Transport was created in 1945 and the Director was made responsible for the duties hitherto performed by two statutory boards—the Central Road Board and the Transport Board. He is assisted by an advisory committee of four members appointed by the Governor.

There are 564 miles of road open for traffic; 305 miles are maintained by the Director of Highways and Transport and the remainder by the parochial authorities.

The Director also exercises a general control over public service vehicles, and in particular over omnibuses, which may operate only on such routes and in accordance with such time tables as he approves.

Shipping

Regular steamship services were disrupted as a result of the war and have not yet been resumed. The principal lines operating at the end of 1948 were the Harrison Line to the United Kingdom and the Alcoa Line and Canadian National Steamships to North America. Barbados is the headquarters of the schooner trade in the Eastern Caribbean.

Air

There is a landing ground with a 5,000 feet hard surfaced runway at Seawell in the south-eastern part of the island. British West Indian Airways, Ltd., provides regular air services to Trinidad, British Guiana and Jamaica and to most of the Windward and Leeward Islands.

Telecommunications

External telecommunication services are operated by:

(1) Cable and Wireless (West Indies), Limited, controlled by Cable and Wireless, Limited. This company owns and operates cable connections with most of the other more important West Indian Islands and British Guiana (all covered by alternative wireless telegraphy links for use when necessary) and through Turks Island and Bermuda to Halifax, where connection is made with the company's North Atlantic cable system to Great Britain and other parts of the world.

The company has also established in the island large long-range wireless installations which, with its previously established wireless coast station, are operated in conjunction with the cable system and provide services with many parts of the world and with a number of the other West Indian Islands which are not connected by cable. The coast station also provides a service with ships at sea.

In 1945 the company, in collaboration with the Barbados Telephone Company, Limited, inaugurated wireless telephone services. U.K., Canada, the U.S.A., Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, British Guiana, Trinidad, Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat, Grenada, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent are covered; also services with Dutch West Indies, Tobago, etc., and extension of the U.K. service service to the continent of Europe are being added.

(2) The Western Telegraph Company, Limited, also controlled by Cable and Wireless, Limited, with direct cable communication with Brazil and South America generally.

(3) The Western Union Telegraph Company, with cable connection to Miami, operated in conjunction with the Western Telegraph Company, Limited.

(4) An aeronautical wireless service is provided by British West Indian Airways, Limited, under Government licence.
Internal telecommunication facilities are provided by:

(a) A telephone service, serving all parts of the island and operated by a private company, The Barbados Telephone Company, Limited, with approximately 3,500 exchange stations, a modern automatic central exchange in Bridgetown and three branch exchanges (one automatic).

(b) A wire broadcasting system, confined to Bridgetown and its suburbs, and provided by a local company, Radio Distribution (Barbados), Limited. The company relays programme items received by wireless from abroad and also broadcasts news of local and West Indian interest.

The only direct broadcast reception practised in the island is from the B.B.C. Empire service and foreign stations operating on short wave lengths. There is no regular local wireless broadcasting service but Cable and Wireless (W.I.), Limited provide complete island coverage on short wave transmission as desired from time to time for official purposes, conferences, and commentaries on sporting events by the different sporting organisations.

Posts

The General Post Office is situated in Bridgetown and transacts all classes of postal business. During 1948, 1,000,237 postal packages were despatched and 1,257,009 received.

Sub-post offices are established in each of the eleven parishes and mails are despatched and received once a day. In the thickly populated area on the sea coast of Christ Church there is an extra sub-post office. In addition one hundred and three post boxes are installed in the suburbs of Bridgetown and in the country districts and these are cleared once a day.

House to house delivery of letters is an old custom and postmen were employed in the Island before they were established in England. A letter posted before noon at the General Post Office will be delivered on the same day.

There are sixty-five licenced sellers of stamps who receive 5 per cent. on stamps sold to the value of 2d. and 2½ per cent. on stamps of value up to 6d.

| 1948-49 | £1,940,467| £2,051,626 |

Public debt, 31st March, 1949, £605,360.

Sinking fund, 31st March, 1949, £234,907.

The details of the public debt at the 31st of March, 1948, are as follows:

| Loan | Sinking Fund |
|------|-------------|
| Public Loan Act, 1914 and Re-imbursement Act, 1941; | £37,000 | £28,018 |
| Public Loan Act, 1942 | £85,650 | £22,808 |
| General Loan Act, 1933 and Public Loans (Redemption) Act, 1933; | £140,920 | £77,165 |
| Waterworks Loan Act, 1935 | £155,500 | £62,681 |
| Education Loan Act, 1935 | £25,750 | £7,696 |
| Education Loan Act, 1935 | £32,140 | £7,488 |
| Education Loan Act, 1935 | £25,000 | £4,955 |
| Waterworks Loan Act, 1941 | £35,400 | £8,247 |
| Local Loan Act, 1941 | £68,000 | £15,849 |

The revenue is derived mainly from customs duty, excise and income tax, including company tax at the rate of 6s. 8d. in the £ of assessable income.

The customs tariff is set out in the Customs Tariff Act of 1921. Whenever practicable specific rates are charged, the heavier duty being on more luxury goods and the low rates, if any, on items of food. *Ad valorem* duty ranges from 6 per cent. for items on the preferential tariff and 30 per cent. on the general tariff. All rates both specific and *ad valorem* are subject to a surtax of 20 per cent. with the exception of items included in the Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The baggage, personal and household effects of consuls and public officers in the service of the Crown transferred to the Colony are exempt duty.

Customs revenue for the financial year 1948–49 amounted to £730,443 compared with £857,391 in the previous year, due to a falling off of supplies from America carrying a higher duty.

Rum is the only article on which an excise duty is levied and this is at the rate of 10s. 7d. per proof wine gallon. £176,870 was collected during the year a decrease of £12,632 on the amount collected in the previous year.

The amount of income tax collected during the year was £671,350, an increase of £62,826 on the amount collected in the previous year. The rates of income tax vary from year to year.

The main items of expenditure during the financial year 1948–49 were: Education, £241,610, an increase of £29,766; Medical Services, £168,000, an increase of £21,548; Roads and Transport, £154,136, an increase of 17,151 due to increased salaries and wages.

Capital Works do not appear in the Estimates but are voted from time to time by the Legislature by means of Resolutions. The total spent under these Resolutions during the year was £566,932.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Since the 1st of April, 1949, Government accounts have been kept in West Indian dollars (£1 = $4·80). They were previously kept in sterling. Commercial accounts are kept in West Indian dollars. Currency notes issued by the Government in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $20 and $100 are legal tender, as also are notes issued by the Governments of British Guiana and Trinidad. There is no local issue of coin, but United Kingdom coin is used, silver being legal tender in any amount.
There are three banks doing business in Barbados:

- Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), paid up capital, £4,975,500.
- Royal Bank of Canada, paid up capital, $35,000,000.
- Canadian Bank of Commerce, paid up capital, $30,000,000.

There is also a Government Savings Bank. On the 30th June, 1948, the bank had 36,883 depositors and the total amount at credit of depositors was £2,021,569.

**Production and Trade**

The trade figures for 1948 showed a decrease in the value of goods imported as compared with 1947 of £778,700, the total being £6,346,230. This decrease was due to a drastic cutting down of imports from America. The chief imports were rice, flour, animal feeding stuffs, lumber, hardware, cotton piece goods, machinery and iron and steel manufactures.

The total value of exports was £3,048,165 compared with £3,715,107 in 1947, the decrease being largely due to the short sugar crop as a result of the drought. The main exports and chief industries of the Island centre round the sugar, molasses and rum industries.

The main exports compared with 1947 are set out in the following table:

| Item          | Quantity       | Value £     |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Sugar         | 82,461         | 1,879,255   |
| Molasses      | 7,887,440      | 1,147,279   |
| Rum           | 1,467,654      | 343,703     |
| Soap          | 806,430        | 31,214      |
| Margarine     | 300,350        | 19,596      |

The United Kingdom, Canada and Newfoundland are the main customers for sugar, rum and molasses, while the other West Indian Colonies import soap and margarine.
