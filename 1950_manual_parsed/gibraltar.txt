GIBRALTAR

SITUATION AND AREA

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long, high mountain called "The Rock," and a flat sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the "North Front." Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¼ of a mile. Its area is 1¾ square miles.

CLIMATE

The general climate of Gibraltar is mild and temperate, though somewhat hot and oppressive during the months of July and August. The rainy season lasts from September to May; the annual average rainfall is 35 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called "The Bay of Gibraltar," which is about 4 or 5 miles across and affords good anchorage for shipping. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock form an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea. At the northern end, between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea, lies the North Front, on which a landing ground was completed during the course of the war. From the northern end, the Rock runs southward to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the Fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lines lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only ¼ by ½ mile. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden called "The Alameda." The civil population of the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south sides of the South mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being taken up with barracks, hospitals, etc., for the Military and the Navy. The Naval harbour is part of the west side of the Rock. It is formed by three separate moles known as the "North," "Detached," and "South" moles. The North Mole runs westward from Devil's Tongue for about 2,900 feet and then southwards, giving a total length of over a mile. The South Mole projects into the sea for a distance of 3,660 feet in a north-west direction. The Detached Mole, 2,717 feet long, is so situated between these two moles as to form a breakwater and leave two means of exit and entrance. The harbour contains a water area of 440 acres. There are three large graving docks for Naval purposes and a small dock which is available for merchant vessels of light draught.

HISTORY

Gibraltar was known to the ancients as Mons Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules, the other being Mount Abyla, or Apes Hill, on the opposite coast of Africa. It was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain.

In 711 the Moorish Chief Tarik-Ibn-Zeyad landed on the Rock, and gave it the name of Gibel-Tarik, or Mountain of Tarik, of which the name of Gibraltar is a corruption. It remained in Moorish hands until 1309, when it was seized by the Spaniards. In 1333 it was again taken by the Moors, but was wrested from the Moslem dynasty in 1462 and reverted to the dominion of Spain.

In 1704, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779–83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

CONSTITUTION

The Government is administered under Letters-Patent of 12th September, 1922, by a Governor aided by an Executive Council composed of four official and three unofficial members. The power of legislation is vested in the Governor who is also the General Officer Commanding the Garrison. It was announced on 24th November, 1948, that a Legislative Council would be established, as soon as the necessary instruments could be prepared, to consist of the Governor and three ex-officio members, two nominated members, and five elected members.

ADMINISTRATION

The revenue of the colony is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, licence duties and fees and import duties.

The present Customs Tariff includes import duties on wines, liquors, spirits, including perfumed spirits, and tobacco with Empire-preferential rates, and on motor spirit.

The management of the drainage, water supply, etc., is in the hands of the City Council, a body which, by legislation enacted in 1945, now contains for the first time in its history a popularly elected majority. The Council's receipts for 1948 were £323,720, its expenditure £309,450 and its debt on 31st December, 1948, £187,839.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education has been compulsory since 1917. Government assumed full responsibility for education in the Colony in 1944 on the repatriation of the civil population. A Director of Education has been appointed and fully qualified teachers, both religious and lay, have been recruited from the United Kingdom on Government contracts. There are at present six secondary and eighteen primary and infants schools in operation with a total number of pupils at 31st December, 1948, of 2,610. Government expenditure on education in 1948 amounted to £47,558 whilst estimated expenditure in 1948 is £50,164.
Information and Public Relations

The duties of Public Relations Officer are discharged by the Chief Assistant Secretary.

Health

The medical and health services of the Colony include:

(a) The Colonial Hospital, containing 153 beds, for the reception of British and other residents, merchant seamen and all civil emergencies.

(b) The King George V Hospital for diseases of the chest, containing 50 beds.

(c) The Infectious Diseases Hospital for the treatment of small-pox, cholera, plague, and yellow fever, with accommodation for 40 beds.

(d) The Mental Hospital with accommodation for 30 beds.

Other services provided by the Colonial Government are:

- Child welfare service.
- Port health service.
- School medical service.
- School dental service.
- Medical service to the Police and Prison Department.
- A General out-patients department at the Colonial Hospital.
- Free domiciliary treatment of the poor, by two part-time district medical officers.
- Domiciliary treatment of Government servants.
- Public vaccination.
- Physiotherapy and radiography.

The following special clinics are held at the Colonial Hospital:

- Antenatal clinic.
- Clinic for diseases of the eye.
- Clinic for diseases of the ear, nose and throat.
- Orthopaedic and fractures clinic.
- Dental clinic.
- Gynaecological and post natal clinic.
- Diabetic clinic.
- Chest clinic.

Labour and Welfare

The staff of the new Department of Labour and Welfare established in 1948 has been concentrated in departmental offices which were extensively reconstructed so as to provide an employment exchange and welfare offices on the ground floor with registry and administrative offices on the upper floor. The senior staff consists of the Director of Labour and Welfare, Employment Exchange Manager, Executive Officer for Resettlement, and two Welfare Officers.

In 1948 the resettlement section of the new department dealt with the repatriation to Gibraltar from the United Kingdom of over 800 persons evacuated during the war.

The Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children (Amendment) Ordinance, 1948, gave the force of law to the following International Conventions: Minimum Age (Trimmers and Stokers) Convention, 1921; Medical Examination of Young Persons (Sea) Convention, 1921; Underground Work (Women) Convention, 1935.

The Employment Exchanges and Registration Ordinance No. 10 of 1949 gives statutory effect to the establishment of the Employment Exchange and provides for the registration of workmen thereat and the regulation of the employment of aliens. A draft workmen's Compensation Ordinance based substantially on the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1946, will be completed when accidents statistics have been acquired, for which purpose a draft Notification of Accidents and Occupational Diseases Ordinance has been completed and submitted for approval prior to publication. In the meantime the system of voluntary notification of accidents which would otherwise be reportable, which was introduced in 1947, continued to operate.

The policy of full employment for British subjects initiated in 1946 was successfully maintained, and the average unemployment amongst male British subjects was less than 0.5 per cent. There were constantly increasing demands for labour, particularly in building trades, as a result of which the total registered labour force rose to 20,000 in December, 1948. This represents an increase of 5 per cent. during the year and an increase of some 4,000 compared with the numbers employed in mid-1946 when the compilation of monthly employment statistics was first introduced. This labour force includes over 12,000 Spaniards who reside in the adjacent Spanish territory and enter and leave the Colony daily.

Industrial grade employees of the Colonial Government, City Council and local service departments continued to work the 44 hour 5 day week which was introduced in 1947. In private industrial employment the normal working week continued to be 48 hours. Shop assistants worked a maximum of 48 hours per week in accordance with the provisions of the Shop Hours (Amendment) Ordinance, 1949. Persons employed in hotels and catering services outside the provisions of the Shop Hours Ordinance worked 48–56 hours per week; although in a number of cases trade union representations secured a shortening of the working week in these trades.

The general structure of the unified basic wage and cost of living allowances payable for employment in Government and service departments remained unchanged during 1948. The minimum basic wage rate of adult unskilled workers so employed was 40s. per week with the addition of cost of living allowance of 32s. per week in the case of Gibraltaritans, and 16s. per week in the case of aliens. Skilled workmen received from 83s. to 93s. per week inclusive of cost of living allowance at the rates specified above.

There were 11 trade unions registered under the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance 1947 with an approximate aggregate membership of 5,000.

Local trade unions were active and submitted claims covering a wide field affecting terms and conditions of employment of both industrial and clerical grades of employees. There were no strikes during 1948 and industrial relations continued to be generally good.

Early in 1948 a comprehensive agreement was concluded between a representative trade union and commercial employers concerned, specifying rates payable to licensed porters for the movement of cargo at the waterport and in Government warehouses. This agreement has operated satisfactorily and has removed a source of long standing friction.

Conditions of employment are co-ordinated by a Standing Wages Committee presided over by the Head of the Labour and Welfare Department and consisting of representatives of each of the service departments, the City Council and the Chamber of Commerce. The Committee held eight meetings during 1948 and dealt with 17 claims relating to conditions of employment. Discussions held with
the representatives of official and private employers and with representatives of trade unions concerning the formation of a Joint Labour Advisory Board have been substantially completed and it is hoped to establish the Labour Advisory Board in 1949.

Monthly computations of the cost of living index are made and the average working class index for 1948 remained substantially stable at 186 compared with 100 in July, 1939.

The public assistance scheme introduced in 1946 now covers financial aid to indigent or disabled persons as well as to the aged and unemployed, in respect of which latter classes of persons statistics are being compiled on which to base unemployment and old age pensions legislation.

**Communications**

**Roads**

The Colony’s roads are vested by law in the City Council, which is responsible for their upkeep. There are no railways or tramways in Gibraltar.

**Shipping**

Owing to its geographical position, Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and a coaling station by vessels of every nationality. The voyage between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom takes about four and a half days.

There is a daily steamer service between Gibraltar and the town of Algeciras on the opposite side of the Bay as well as a weekly service with Tangier.

**Air**

British European Airways operate four services a week between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom via Madrid and Bordeaux.

Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service between Gibraltar and Tangier (five flights a day).

**Postal**

Air mail correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom twice a week. Transmission time is two days.

Ordinary correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom by the overland mail service which was resumed on the 10th February, 1948. Time in transit averages 4 days.

Air mail services exist to most countries and facilities are being extended as world conditions improve.

A daily service is maintained with the continent of Europe and North Africa.

**Telegraphs**

The Government land lines connecting Gibraltar with Spain are worked by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., who have a station at Gibraltar. Telegrams are accepted for all parts of the world.

**Telephones**

The telephone system is under the control of the City Council. Telephone communication is at present restricted to the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Spanish Morocco and Tangier.

The local Naval and Military departments have their own lines which are connected with the City Council scheme.
