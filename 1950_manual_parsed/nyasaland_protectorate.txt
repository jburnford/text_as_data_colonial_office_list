NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

SITUATION AND AREA

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shire Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shire) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shire Highlands and Malanje.

In the absence of adequate survey it is not possible to state accurately the total area, but according to latest estimates the land area is believed to be some 36,829 square miles.

CLIMATE

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the plains and the other of the hills. In the part of the Great Rift Valley which traverses the country from end to end and is occupied for the greater part by Lake Nyasa and the Shire Valley, the climate is hot and unhealthy with temperatures sometimes reaching 120° in the shade just before the rains. Rainfall in this zone does not as a rule exceed 35 inches.

The upland areas are healthier with temperatures varying between a maximum of 97° and a minimum of 40°; at some of the higher elevations temperatures occasionally fall below 40° and frost is sometimes recorded at night. Rainfall in this zone varies from 40 to 100 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Protectorate is bounded on the north-east by Tanganyika, on the north-west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south-east and south-west by Portuguese East Africa. The south-eastern boundary with Portuguese East Africa at Lake Nyasa is the eastern or Portuguese coast of the lake and thus the greater part of the Lake Nyasa is contained within the boundaries of the Protectorate.

POPULATION

The protectorate is divided into three provinces, Northern, Central and Southern, each under the control of a provincial commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into 14 administrative areas, each in charge of a district commissioner, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shire Highlands. There were 699 Europeans and 1,168 Asiatics in the Blantyre district in 1945. The Headquarters of the Government are at Zomba. The figures of population given by the 1945 census were: Europeans, 1,948; Asiatics, 2,804; Africans, 2,044,707. The estimated population at the end of 1948 was: Europeans, 2,970; Asiatics, 4,300; Africans, 2,270,000.

RELIGION

No official statistics are available regarding the religious affiliations of the African population. The majority are probably still pagans, but a large number are Christians. There is a comparatively small group of Mohammedans to be found almost entirely among members of the Yao tribe. More than half of the Asiatics are Mohammedans, and about a quarter are Hindus. The remainder are mostly Christians or Sikhs. Of the Europeans, nearly half belong to the Church of England, the next largest denominations being the Presbyterians and the Roman Catholics. The remaining Christians represent among them nineteen different denominations. There were 32 Agnostics in 1945.

Missionary societies have been at work in the Protectorate for over seventy years. The principal societies, in order of arrival, are the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland Mission, the Dutch Reformed Church Mission, the White Fathers, the Montfort Marist Fathers, and the Seventh Day Adventists. There are a number of smaller societies and African separatist churches. The Church of Central Africa (Presbyterian) is a union of the African congregations adhering to the Scots and Dutch Reformed Missions.

HISTORY

There are various Portuguese records from 1616 onwards of occasional journeys across the southern end of what is now the Nyasaland Protectorate, and in the eighteenth century Portuguese officials and miners penetrated as far as the Luangwa Valley in Northern Rhodesia, but these left no lasting impression on the country. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century there was constant passage through and settlement in Nyasaland by migrating Bantu tribes, but their traditions are too vague to be given the name of history, which, for Nyasaland, may be said to begin with David Livingstone's discovery of Lake Nyasa on 16th September, 1859.

The path he opened was followed by the pioneers of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), but these soon had to retire after heavy losses from disease, and the Universities' Mission did not return to Nyasaland until 1881. Inspired by Livingstone's work, both the Church of Scotland and the Free Church of Scotland established Missions as memorials to him. In 1874-5, at a time when the country was a whirlpool of migrant tribes, warring with each other and selling their prisoners to Arab and
half-caste slave dealers, the work of pacification which occupied most of the remainder of the nineteenth century owed much to the missionary leaders. To relieve them of the business side of their activities the African Lakes Company (now the African Lakes Corporation) was formed in 1878 as a transport and trading concern to work in close co-operation with the Scots Missions. These pioneers were followed by other Europeans, missionaries, traders, hunters, and coffee planters, and in 1883 a British Consul, resident at Blantyre, was accredited to "the Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government.

By now the first of Nyasaland's nineteenth century invaders, the Angoni—who are entitled to claim descent from Chaka's Zulus—had almost ended their wanderings, which had taken them in 50 years from Natal to Lake Tanganyika and back to the hinterland of Lake Nyasa. The Yaos, starting from somewhere about the headwaters of the Rovuma River, on the modern border between Tanganyika Territory and Portuguese East Africa, were still on the move round the south end of Lake Nyasa, warring as they went. At the same time the slave-traders at the north end of the country were becoming steadily more inconvenienced by the competition in religion and commerce with which they were now faced, and in 1888 trouble, followed by open warfare, arose between the Arab leaders of the trade and the African Lakes Company, who had to expend most of their resources on military operations. Fortunately for Nyasaland it came under the eye of Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company came to the financial rescue.

About this time, too, the Portuguese Government began to cast interested eyes on the lands to the north of the Zambesi, on which river it had long had military and trading posts, and there was a certain degree of international friction. In 1889, however, one cause of friction was removed by the discovery of a navigable route through the Zambesi delta from the Indian Ocean which made Nyasaland accessible, by way of this route, the Zambesi, and the Shire, by an international waterway without touching Portuguese territory. Nevertheless, in the same year a conflict took place on the Lower Shire between a well-armed Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto and one of the Makololo chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on 21st September 1889, almost exactly 30 years after Livingstone first set foot on the shores of Lake Nyasa. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate", but in 1907 a further Order-in-Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate".

By 1896 the slave trade was extinguished and the countries of the Yao and the Southern Angoni were pacified, although the Northern Angoni did not come fully within the sphere of British Administration until 1904. They had, however, long given up raiding their neighbours, largely because of the influence acquired over their Paramount Chief by Dr. Laws of Livingstonia. Since then Nyasaland has known only one internal disturbance, the Chilembwe Rising, which occurred in 1915, when a native pastor, egged on by the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges. Rapid counter-measures were taken and the rising fizzled out. To the credit of the rebels it must be recorded that such European women and children as fell into their hands were treated with great consideration.

In 1914 the long border with German East Africa made Nyasaland's position dangerous, but prompt action on both land and water scotched the immediate danger, and the Protectorate was able to contribute greatly to the British forces employed in the East African campaign. The outbreak of war in 1939 found the Protectorate far from any front, but nevertheless able to aid the war effort considerably in both men and materials. The two regular battalions of the King's African Rifles were expanded to 12, who added Abyssinia, Madagascar and Burma to a list of campaigning grounds which already covered Africa from British Somaliland to Ashanti, and in all some 30,000 of all races in Nyasaland served in the armed forces between 1939 and 1945.

CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION

The administration of the Protectorate, control of which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order-in-Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established. The former at present consists of the Governor, three ex officio members, and four nominated members, two of the latter being unofficials. The Legislative Council, of which the Governor is President, consists of nine official members and nine unofficial members nominated by the Governor. Of the nine unofficial members, one may be a missionary; five are nominated on the advice of unofficial bodies; two African members are nominated on the recommendation of the African Protectorate Council and one member is nominated from among the Asiatic community on the recommendation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

Native local government was instituted in 1933, the traditionally-appointed tribal chiefs being established as Native Authorities with powers defined by law. African Provincial Councils were established in 1944 and 1945, consisting of chiefs and leading commoners, and an African Protectorate Council, drawn from the Provincial Councils, was established in 1946: these Councils discuss and advise the Government upon matters affecting the native population.

The laws consist of local ordinances duly enacted, with such British acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate courts are held by magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decisions of the High Court are now heard by the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Court of Appeal. There is also a system of Native Courts, in many cases under the presidency of Native Authorities. These deal with the great majority of native civil cases and with a
large number of petty criminal matters and statutory offences. Appeals from these lie to Native Appeal Courts and thence through the District and Provincial Commissioners to the High Court.

**The Central African Council**

During the late war the need was felt for closer consultation and co-operation between the three Central African territories, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia, and an Inter-Territorial Secretariat was established in Salisbury in 1941. This was replaced in 1945 by a Central African Council under the chairmanship of the Governor of Southern Rhodesia and consisting of the Governors and three representatives of each territory, those from Nyasaland being at present the Chief Secretary, the Hon. Mr. M. P. Barrow, C.B.E., and the Hon. Mr. G. G. S. Hadlow, O.B.E., who are Nominated Members of Executive Council and Legislative Council. The Council meets twice a year, and carries on its work through a permanent Secretariat and a number of Committees. Its functions are consultative and advisory in character.

**Social Services**

**Education**

In 1944 the Secretary of State approved a five-year plan for the development of the education of all races in the protectorate, and supported it with a grant of £295,000, from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote, to cover capital expenditure up to £65,000, and one-half of the total recurrent expenditure over the five-year period (£280,000). In April, 1945, a new Education Ordinance was enacted to give retrospective effect to the plan as from 1st January, 1945. Its operation is reflected in the increase of the Government grant to missions for African education from approximately £11,500 in 1939, to £93,043 in 1948. The development programme also includes provision for the extension of secondary education in the case of Africans, and scholarships for university education for all races.

**Information Services**

A Public Relations branch of the Secretariat was established in February 1949 under the direction of the Public Relations Officer. The office undertakes all Information and Public Relations duties within the Protectorate, and is also responsible for tourist development. The Publicity Bureau in Blantyre is a branch office of the Public Relations office in Zomba. Departmental plans provide for two mobile information units, each in charge of a European officer with African assistants. These units will operate in the Districts to give information and instruction, as well as entertainment, to the local African populations. A film library is being built up, and films will be available to privately owned 16 mm. projectors for showing to African employees on estates. 16 and 35 mm. versions of "British News" and British documentary films are distributed to commercial, private and official cinemas. Plans for the extension of broadcasting and listening facilities to Africans are in hand, and the use of cheap battery-operated radio sets is expected to widen this field considerably in the near future. Press communiques containing news of official activities and plans are distributed to the local newspapers and to others outside the Protectorate. A weekly vernacular news sheet has been issued by the Public Relations Officer. It had a circulation of about 11,000 copies. This news sheet was replaced in October, 1949, by a four-page African newspaper in English and Chinyanja to meet part of the African demand for more and better reading material. Supplies of books and literature from the Information Department of the Colonial Office and the Central Office of Information are distributed throughout Nyasaland. A photographic section is to be set up, and this will enable useful publicity material to be produced.

**Health**

Government maintains three small European hospitals: at the capital, Zomba, and at two of the three provincial headquarters, Blantyre and Lilongwe. In 1948 a total of 2,853 new cases, of whom 634 were admitted as in-patients, received treatment at these hospitals.

There are in the Protectorate 19 Government African hospitals. Normally eight are in the charge of a European Medical Officer, six of an Asiatic Sub-Assistant Surgeon and five of an African Hospital Assistant. In 1948, these hospitals dealt with 383,145 new cases, of whom 28,534 were admitted as in-patients.

There are 96 Government rural dispensaries scattered throughout the country. They are in the charge of Hospital Assistants and Medical Aides. While the standard of diagnosis is not high they carry out most useful work treating the common diseases of the country. 571,302 new cases attended these rural dispensaries in 1948. Development plans have made provision for a large increase in the number of dispensaries, and for the status of many of them to be raised to that of Health Units employing a Hospital Assistant, a Medical Aide, a Midwife and a Sanitary Assistant. Many missions and large estates maintain dispensaries of their own.

Government provides wards for Asiatics and Eur-Africans at Blantyre, and wards for Asiatics at Zomba and Lilongwe.

Government employs three specialist officers, a Surgeon, a Pathologist and a Dental Officer. The first two are engaged in work mainly for the benefit of Africans while the Dental Officer can only afford a small part of his time for African work. All three teach in the training school for Africans at the capital.

Four European Health Inspectors are employed by Government and one of them is responsible for the training of African Sanitary Assistants.

In addition to hospitals provided by Government the following missionary bodies maintain African hospitals—The Universities Mission to Central Africa, the Church of Scotland, the Dutch Reformed Church of South Africa, the Catholic Missions and the Seventh Day Adventist Missions. With the exception of the Catholic Missions all employ medical practitioners.

About 80 per cent. of the antenatal, maternity and child welfare work is in the hands of the above-mentioned mission bodies which receive subsidies for this work from Government. In 1948, antenatal new cases numbered 7,620, confinements 6,745 and infant welfare new cases 6,759.

Although Government is about to engage in the treatment and control of leprosy by establishing a large settlement of its own in the Central Province, up to the present such work, except for out-patients treated at Government hospitals, has been carried out by missions. Government supplies free drugs and dressings together with financial aid on a per capita basis. In 1948 there was a daily average of 907 patients in settlements throughout the country.
Drugs used in the treatment of venereal diseases are issued without charge to non-Government medical organisations. 16,899 cases of venereal disease were treated at Government institutions in 1948 and 1,278 at non-Government institutions.

Government trains its own African subordinate medical and sanitary staff at a school attached to the African hospital in the capital, Zomba.

It can be said with safety that the bulk of the African population is now hospital minded and indeed clamours for additional curative facilities. The old prejudices against hospitals have broken down, but we have yet to inculcate the value of prevention and personal hygiene. The provision for Health Visitors in development plans will, it is hoped, set us on the way to achieving a measure of positive health.

Labour

There is at present little organised welfare work amongst labour in Nyasaland.

Free mid-day meals and hot drinks are being provided for workers by an increasing number of employers, particularly in the tea and tobacco industries.

"Music whilst you work", and wireless broadcasts, and in some instances cinema shows, are being experimented with by some of the larger firms.

Many of the estates have established schools for the children of their workers, and facilities for football exist in some of the larger concerns.

Communications

Roads and Railways

There is a 3 feet 6 inches gauge railway system extending from the port of Beira, in Portuguese East Africa, to Chipoka on Lake Nyasa (496 miles) crossing the Zambesi at Sena (199 miles) by the Lower Zambesi Bridge and passing through Blantyre (353 miles). Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the protectorate, the total mileage being approximately 4,000. The Nyasaland road system is linked up with the Great North Road to Tanganyika and Kenya, and also to the Portuguese road system through Tete to Southern Rhodesia.

Air

There is an aerodrome, suitable for aircraft up to 30,000 lb. single wheel load, at Chileka. At Lilongwe, during the winter only, aircraft up to 20,000 lb. single wheel load can be operated, but in the rainy season the all-up weight of aircraft must be considerably reduced. At Zomba and most district stations, seasonal landing grounds are available.

Postal

Air mails from and to adjoining countries and overseas are received three times weekly; surface mails are received and despatched by train from and to all destinations twice weekly.

Internal mail services by road operate daily on most routes and by air, road and rail twice weekly on other routes. There are at present 44 post offices in the Protectorate.

Telegraphs

Telegraph offices exist at all the more important places in the Territory, there being 30 telegraph offices and 14 railway telegraph offices.

The African Trans-Continental Telegraph Company's line, taken over by Government in 1925, forms the main trunk telegraph route between Southern Rhodesia and Tanganyika, with Zomba and Blantyre as the main transmitting stations.

Wireless stations have been erected at Zomba, Karonga, Likoma, Lilongwe, Mkhoma and Mzimba.

Telephones

All towns in the Southern Province are connected by telephone.

No external telephone communication is possible outside the Protectorate except that provided by the Nyasaland Railways over their telegraph system to Beira, P.E.A.

Currency and Banking

By a proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling, and by Proclamation No. 11 of 1933, Rhodesian silver coin was declared legal tender.

Banking operations in the protectorate are governed by the Banking Ordinance, 1902. Two banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., and Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas); the former has branches at Zomba, Limbe and Lilongwe, and the latter has a branch at Limbe.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank.

Trade and Commerce

Tobacco is the dominant export from Nyasaland while tea ranks next in importance. Cotton still holds an important place and finds ready sale in hard currency markets, but the outstanding expansion has been in the export of tung oil which increased in export volume from 20 long tons in 1942 to 354 tons in 1948 with respective values of £5,000 and £67,000.

In 1948 tobacco exports reached the record figure of 24 million lb. representing 42·45 per cent. of the total volume of the Protectorate's export trade; tea also created a record with 15 million lb. or 26·83 per cent., cotton lint 4 million lb., 8·73 per cent., soya beans 1 million lb., 1·75 per cent. Other exports included sisal fibre, rubber, cotton seed, beans, animal feeding stuffs, and tung oil.

Principal imports were cotton manufactures £1,636,586 (of which £1,524,063 represented cotton piece goods); iron, steel and metal manufactures £186,444; petrol £96,452; vehicles and parts £406,757; wood and timber manufactures £65,118; earthenware and chinaware £43,962; agricultural machinery £6,293; industrial machinery £198,473; bicycles £83,569; hardware and hollow-ware £152,739; wearing apparel and haberdashery £100,590; provisions £223,768 (including salt and sugar) oils and fats (soap making) £40,295; chemicals, drugs, dyes, etc. £133,690; leather manufactures (boots and shoes) £32,313; tyres and tubes £78,726.

* Includes interest, grants-in-aid, etc., towards public debt charges and railway commitments.
Principal exports were tobacco 10,646 long tons valued at £2,250,049; tea 6,728 valued at £1,350,445; cotton lint 2,190 valued at £369,145; tung oil 354 valued at £66,966; soya beans 439—£11,625.

The United Kingdom supplied 44 per cent. of import merchandise, the British Empire 24 per cent. and Foreign Countries 32 per cent. Of the latter, the contribution from the United States of America was 11 per cent. Of export produce, the United Kingdom absorbed 57 per cent., the British Empire 23 per cent. and Foreign countries 20 per cent.

The following tables of imports and exports include Government imports and re-exports and exclude bullion and specie.

The Nyasaland customs tariff applies to imports from all nations in view of agreements ratified under the Congo Basin Treaties 1895 and the Convention of St. Germain en Laye, 1919.

Import duties are specific and ad valorem. The latter varying from 3 per cent. to 50 per cent. Values for customs assessment are C.I.F. cost Beria, Quelimane or Mozambique.

Export duty is not levied, but with effect from 1st January, 1949, there is an export tax of two-pence per lb. on tea and, with effect from 1st April, 1949, a similar export tax on tobacco was imposed, the rates being twopence per lb. on leaf tobacco and threepence on strips. In addition to the export tax which is a revenue measure cess at the rate of tenpence per one hundred lb. is levied on all tea exported and one penny halfpenny per one hundred lb. on all tobacco exported. Tung oil similarly carries a cess of £2 10s. per long ton exported. The proceeds from the cess collections are returned to the Tea, Tobacco and Tung Associations for the benefit of the respective industries.
