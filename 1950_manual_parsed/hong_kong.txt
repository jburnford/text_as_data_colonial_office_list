HONG KONG
Situation and Area

The Colony of Hong Kong is situated at the mouth of the Canton River about 40 miles east of Macao and 91 miles south of Canton between 22° 9' and 22° 35' N. latitude and 113° 50' and 114° 30' E. longitude. The island of Hong Kong on which is situated the capital city of Victoria is about 11 miles long and of a breadth varying from two to five miles, its area being about 32 square miles. Opposite to the island is the peninsula of Kowloon (34 square miles) which was ceded to Great Britain in 1860. A number of smaller islands including Stonecutters Island (3 square mile) Green Island and Aplichau, are also included in the ceded territory of the Colony of Hong Kong. The other component of the colony is the New Territories which were leased for a period of 99 years from the Chinese Government by an agreement concluded in 1898. The total area of the New Territories, which includes a large number of islands as well as a portion of the mainland lying behind Kowloon, is about 359 square miles, making the total area of the colony 391 square miles.

CLIMATE

The climate of Hong Kong is sub-tropical, and is governed to a large extent by the monsoons, the winter being normally cool and dry, and the summer hot and humid. The range of temperatures is very considerable, falling from a monthly average of 82° in July to 59° in February, the average for the year being 72°. The temperature very rarely rises above 95° or falls below 40°. The humidity in spring and summer is very high, at times reaching 95 per cent., while in early winter it may fall as low as 20 per cent. The mean annual rainfall is about 85 inches, of which about 67 inches normally falls between May and September. Sunshine varies from an average of 94 hours in the month of March to 217 hours during October.

The north-east monsoon sets in during October and lasts until April. The early winter is the most pleasant time of the year, the weather being generally sunny and the atmosphere often exceedingly dry. Later in the winter, cloud is more frequent though rainfall remains slight until May. The transition from winter to summer monsoon is fairly rapid. During this transitional period, fog and very low cloud are common. From May until September, winds are generally from a southerly quarter, humidity is high, and rainfall may be heavy. Typhoons may occur between June and October, although they are sometimes experienced before or after this period. There is little difference between the climate of the island and that of the immediately adjacent mainland though generally the temperature on the island is slightly lower and the humidity slightly greater, but the northern part of the leased territory has a much lower rainfall.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The waterways of the colony with an area of ten square miles form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world. The entrance from the east is by the Lyemun Strait (Lei Yu Mun) where less than half a mile separates the island from the mainland. The granite hills which surround it rise between two and three thousand feet high, the whole forming a panorama of singular beauty. At the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour the city of Victoria proper extends for nearly five miles, and a built-up area extends for over three miles east of the original city boundary. Most of the urban area is flat reclaimed land, though streets and houses have straggled some way up the hillside away from the harbour, and residences (many now ruined by indiscriminate looting during the Japanese occupation) cling high on the slopes of Victoria Peak (1,823 feet).

The Kowloon Peninsula, which was formerly covered by low hills but has been extensively levelled, has been extended in area by various reclamations and has developed rapidly as a residential suburb. It contains also the main industrial area of the colony, while on the western shore are the wharves for ocean-going ships, and the terminus of the Kowloon-Canton railway occupies the extreme southern tip of the peninsula. On the reclaimed area at the northern end of Kowloon Bay lies the colony’s only aerodrome at Kai Tak.

Behind Kowloon lies the main part of the new territories, by far the larger part of which consists of steep and barren hillsides. The highest point is the mountain of Tai Mo Shan which lies seven miles north-west of Kowloon and is 3,130 feet in height. The eastern side of the New Territories mainland is mountainous and extends to the rocky and deeply indented coastline of Mirs Bay. A few villages make a frugal living by farming its narrow valleys and fishing the innumerable inlets.
In the north-western part of the New Territories lies the colony’s main area of cultivable land stretching to the marshes on the eastern shore of Deep Bay. Also included in the New Territories are 75 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The largest of these is Lantao (Tai Yu Shan), an island more than twice the size of Hong Kong island itself, rugged and beautiful in appearance, and rising to twin peaks of over 3,000 feet.

**POPULATION**

No official census has been taken since 1931 when the total population was found to be 849,751. By 1941 the figure was estimated to have risen to over 1,600,000. During the Japanese occupation the population fell rapidly until by August, 1945, it was estimated to be less than 600,000. Since then there has been a great influx of people from South China, and while no accurate estimate can be made it is considered that the total population of the Colony in June, 1949, was about 1,857,000, including about 9,500 British subjects from the United Kingdom and the Dominions, 797 Portuguese, about 3,000 British subjects of Portuguese race, 202 Americans and 123 stateless persons. It is expected that a census will be taken in 1950.

**RELIGION**

There are in the Colony an Anglican Cathedral, a Roman Catholic Cathedral, and a considerable number of churches and chapels of Anglican, Roman Catholic and various other denominations, both for the European population and for those of the Chinese population who are Christians. There is also a Jewish community in the Colony.

The religion of the bulk of the Chinese population is a blend of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, but it includes a fair proportion of Christians and a small number of Muslims. The Indian community consists mainly of Parsees, Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims.

**HISTORY**

Until 1841 the island now known as Hong Kong was inhabited only by a few fishermen, stonecutters and farmers, and provided a notorious retreat for smugglers and pirates. In January of that year, it was occupied by British forces, partly as a reprisal for the treatment of British merchants in Canton and partly as a base from which trade with China could be conducted free from the excesses of arbitrary power. The cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in August, 1842. In 1860 the Convention of Peking added the Kowloon Peninsula and Stonecutters Island to the Crown Colony; and under a further Convention of Peking, signed in 1898, the New Territories, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, up to the high water line on their northern shores, were leased to Great Britain for a period of 99 years.

Almost a century of uninterrupted peaceful development followed the Treaty of Nanking. The fine natural harbour developed into one of the world’s great ports, and the freedom of the port ensured the role of entrepôt both for the trade and for the labour of China’s southern provinces. Reclaimations were carried out, roads built, and anti-malarial measures initiated; shipyards capable of constructing 10,000-ton ships, docks to accommodate the world’s largest liners, and light industries all developed with the years.

In 1938, the fall of Canton to the Japanese invaders brought thousands of homeless refugees from South China. Hong Kong itself was attacked on 8th December, 1941, and fell on Christmas day after 18 days’ fighting. The ensuing occupation by the Japanese lasted for over 3½ years, during which Europeans were interned, while many of those not interned also suffered great hardships. Liberation came at last on 30th August, 1945, when units of the British Pacific Fleet entered the harbour. For the ensuing eight months the colony was governed by a military administration, and on 1st May, 1946, civil government was re-established. With the return of civil government came the news that His Majesty’s Government wished to accord to the people of Hong Kong a fuller and more responsible share in the management of their own affairs. Developments towards this end are described below.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Government is administered, under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor advised by an Executive Council at present comprising in addition to the Governor six official and six unofficial members, three of whom are Chinese; and by a Legislative Council presided over by the Governor, and comprising not more than nine official and eight unofficial members. Of the unofficial members of the Legislative Council six are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor, three being Chinese; one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members of the Executive and Legislative Councils vacate their seats, after five and four years respectively, from date of appointment.

There is also an Urban Council in which are vested, *inter alia*, powers of making bye-laws in respect of certain matters relating to public health and sanitation.

The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Hong Kong Ordinances of which an edition, revised to 1931, was published in 1938. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901. The Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases.

Proposals for a new constitution were approved by the Secretary of State for the Colonies in July, 1947. They envisaged the reduction of the number of official members of the Legislative Council from 9 to 7, the number of unofficial members remaining 8, so that an unofficial majority would be created; and the institution of a Municipal Council. This would consist of 30 members, two-thirds of them popularly elected and one-third nominated by representative bodies. The Chinese community would be represented by one-half of the members of the Council, and the non-Chinese also by one half. The Council’s administrative area would comprise the whole of the Island of Hong Kong, the ceded Kowloon territory and that part of the New Territories known as New Kowloon. The Council would be responsible for the discharge of such functions as are delegated to it by the Legislature; the intention would be that these should represent a considerable enlargement of those performed by the existing Urban Council.

However, in August, 1949, the Governor remitted for the consideration of the Secretary of
State for the Colonies certain fresh proposals embodied in a motion passed in the Legislative Council with the support of all the unofficial members and backed by such other indications of public opinion as were available. These proposals were based on the view that those already approved no longer represented the best means of widening the share of the population in the management of the Colony's affairs; they envisage instead a further widening of the basis of unofficial representation in the Legislative Council, to which development of a Municipal Council would be secondary.

**ADMINISTRATION**

Under the general direction of the Colonial Secretariat, the administrative functions of Government are discharged by some 30 Departments, all the officers of which are members of the Civil Service. There are five Legal sub-departments excluding the Judiciary. The Financial Secretary has, since 1938, assumed a purely administrative function in the Secretariat and under his direction, the Treasury is responsible for the public accounts. The assessment and collection of rates is the responsibility of the Commissioner, Rating and Valuation Department, while the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is concerned with the collection of miscellaneous indirect taxation and of the direct taxation levied under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, 1947. The Director of Commerce and Industry is charged with the collection of import and excise duties and with the direction of preventive work.

The Secretary for Chinese Affairs, who is a senior administrative officer, has a wide and general responsibility in all matters affecting the Chinese community. The Commission of Labour is responsible, *inter alia*, for ensuring that conditions in factories and workshops are in accordance with the requirements of existing legislation. He also provides a channel for the pursuit of negotiations between the parties involved in a trade dispute. The Social Welfare Officer operates under the general direction of the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Public Health is the responsibility of the Medical Department and the Sanitary Department. The Public Works Department concerns itself with roads, buildings, waterworks, piers, government transport and similar matters.

The administration of the New Territories is in the charge of a District Commissioner assisted by a District Officer for each of the three districts.

The Head of the Sanitary Department is *ex officio* the Chairman of the Urban Council. The functions and authority of this council are more restricted than its title suggests and are subordinate in many respects to the executive authority of Government. The Council's power to originate subsidiary legislation in matters concerning public health and conservancy is subject to confirmation by the Legislative Council.

Other permanent Government departments are the Audit Department, the Education Department which controls the Government schools and supervises all private schools within the Colony, the Fire Brigade, Marine Department, Civil Aviation Department, Police Department, Kowloon-Canton Railway, Post Office which controls Radio Hong Kong, the Prison Department, the Royal Observatory, the Public Relations Office and the Department of Statistics. Four departments, originally set up under the Development Secretariat, deal with fisheries, agriculture, forestry and gardens.

A number of temporary departments are in existence, including the Office of the Custodian of Property and the Department of Supplies and Distribution which supervises rationing, price control and the importation of certain controlled commodities.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Education in Hong Kong is voluntary and is controlled by the terms of the Education Ordinance, 1913. Under this ordinance all schools, unless specially exempted, are required to register with the Director of Education and must comply with the regulations under the ordinance governing staff, buildings, number of pupils in classes and health.

The number of students enrolled is approximately 130,000 and these are accommodated in 797 registered schools.

The schools in the colony may be classified as follows:

(a) Government schools, staffed and maintained by the Education Department.

(b) Grant schools, run mainly by missionary bodies with the assistance of a grant from Government to meet the difference between approved expenditure and income.

(c) Subsidized schools, those private schools in receipt of a subsidy from Government.

(d) Private schools which are not in need of or do not merit Government assistance.

(e) Military schools and certain others which are exempted from the provisions of the Education Ordinance.

The medium of instruction in schools varies from one category to another. In some, English is the sole language, in others Chinese, and a number of schools have classes in both languages. The Grant schools mainly use English, although one such school is entirely taught in Chinese. Teaching in subsidized and private schools is usually carried out in Chinese. Secondary education is to a great extent in the hands of government and grant-aided schools, while subsidized schools and private schools are largely concerned with, though not confined to, the field of primary education. In this field, however, Government is playing an increasingly large part, and plans are prepared for further extensions in the direction of semi-vocational government primary schools.

Classes for adults in both technical and academic subjects are carried on under the aegis of the Government Evening Institute. The Government Technical College provides full courses in wireless telegraphy and building and proposes shortly to offer tuition in marine engineering. The Northcote Training College and the Rural Training College are maintained for those intending to take up teaching in urban and rural schools respectively. Election to both training colleges is by selection and students are provided with free tuition and subsistence allowances.

The University of Hong Kong was incorporated in 1911 and opened in 1912. By 1941 there were in existence, in addition to classroom accommodation for 500 students, six hostels, laboratories, staff residences, a gymnasium, workshops and playing fields. As a result of the occupation of the colony the university suffered considerable loss or damage to equipment and buildings. Towards the end of 1946 it was reopened and a total of 109 students were admitted to the faculties.
of medicine, engineering, arts and science. Since then, there has been considerable rehabilitation of buildings and equipment and the number of students at present attending courses is 506. In April, 1948, the University was formally reconstituted.

**Health**

The functions of the Medical Department are separated into three divisions: hospitals, health and investigation. The hospitals division, which includes out-patient departments and public dispensaries, cares for the sick and injured in ten separate hospitals, fifteen dispensaries and three polyclinics. The hospitals provide approximately 1,670 beds for accidents, infectious diseases (including tuberculosis), mental and general diseases. Most of the hospital accommodation is on Hong Kong island and a smaller number of beds is available on the Kowloon Peninsula and in the New Territories.

The Tung Wah group of hospitals, which includes the Tung Wah, Tung Wah Eastern and Kwong Wah hospitals, and which are in receipt of a large subsidy from Government, provide approximately 1,040 beds. Financial assistance is also granted by Government to the Nethersole Hospital, which has approximately 130 beds, and the Hong Kong Anti-Tuberculosis Association's Ruttongee Sanatorium, which has approximately 110 beds.

The health division has a variety of functions, including the control of anti-epidemic measures such as vaccination, inoculation, disinfection, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, the neonatal care of infants, and the inspection and treatment of school children. This division is also responsible for malaria control, port health work, including the airport and railway terminus, food and drug control, public health propaganda, the treatment and prevention of social diseases and the registration of births and deaths. The supervision of the cleanliness of houses, streets, open spaces and markets outside the urban area is also the responsibility of this division.

The investigation division is subdivided into pathological laboratories (one on each side of the harbour), a chemical laboratory, a biochemical laboratory, and public mortuaries where autopsies are carried out on all bodies of persons where the cause of death is in doubt.

On 15th August, 1949, the staff of the Medical Department consisted of:

- **Doctors**, 120, of whom 92 were Chinese.
- **Nurses and Hospital Dressers**, 522, of whom 408 were Chinese.
- **Health Inspectors**, 21, of whom 18 were Chinese.
- **Others** (including technicians, subordinate and menial staff), 1,895, mostly Chinese.

The Health Inspectorate working within the urban area was transferred to the control of the Urban Council as from 1st April, 1949, and this accounts for the reduction in the establishment of Health Inspectors and others (including technicians, subordinate and menial staff) as compared with last year's figures.

**Labour**

The Labour Department is concerned mainly with—

(a) The inspection and registration of factories with the aim of educating management and enforcing the safety and health provisions of the Factories and Workshops Ordinance (No. 18 of 1937);

(b) The enforcement of regulations concerning the hours of work and conditions of service of women and young persons;

(c) The provision of conciliation machinery for the settlement of disputes about wages and other terms of service and the fostering of satisfactory employer/employee relationships;

(d) The encouragement of modern trade unionism, and guidance in framing the internal organization of the Unions themselves;

(e) The implementation of such International Labour Conventions as can be applied to the Colony either completely or with modifications.

There is a Labour Advisory Board, under the chairmanship of the Commissioner for Labour, and its members represent the interests of European and Chinese employers and of Chinese labour. The Board is consulted on all matters of importance affecting labour.

Existing labour legislation includes—

(a) Factories and Workshop Ordinance (No. 18 of 1937), which provides, *inter alia*, for the registration and inspection of factories.

(b) The Employers' and Servants' Ordinance (No. 45 of 1902) which provides for the giving of notice or payment of wages in lieu before dismissal in the case of monthly contracts of service.

(c) The Trade Boards Ordinance (No. 15 of 1940) which provides the machinery for fixing minimum wages, overtime rates and normal working hours in trades where wage standards are unreasonable.

(d) The Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance, 1948, which provides a statutory framework for the registration of Trade Unions and defines the rights and obligations of unions and their members.

(e) The Illegal Strikes and Lock-outs Ordinance, 1949, which defines when strikes and lock-outs may be illegal. The Ordinance was passed in April, 1949, and has validity for one year only, but may be re-enacted.

Projected legislation includes a Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.

**Social Welfare**

All social welfare work in Hong Kong has to be carried out against a background of unrestricted Chinese immigration, a densely overcrowded population, sensitivity to political events or natural disasters over the border in South China, and the absence of any abundant natural resources except fish, some stone, and sand. Moreover, for the overwhelming majority of both Chinese and Western residents, Hong Kong is not their real home.

The Social Welfare Office was established in August, 1947, as specialised sub-department of the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs. Its principal responsibilities include—

(a) The probation service, and supervision of a girls' approved school;
public assistance, and relief measures for destitute members of vulnerable groups, and for the victims of fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;

(c) building up community development through urban neighbourhoods;

(d) children's clubs for underprivileged children, which provide training through informal classes, vocational hobbies, organised recreation, and simple children's co-operatives;

(e) protection of women and girls, and the suppression of those who traffic in them, exploit them, or ill-treat them;

(f) child welfare, including home visiting, placing of children in orphanages, etc., and liaison with orphanages;

(g) encouragement and development of all constructive youth welfare work.

A very great deal of the social welfare work in the Colony is carried out by over sixty voluntary organisations which in general belong to one or other of four distinct groups: Western charitable organisations, purely Chinese benevolent associations, institutions, and youth welfare organisations. Government provides heavy indirect subsidies to many of these organisations, and in addition grants subventions in cash to nearly thirty of them.

COMMUNICATIONS

Internal Communications

Kowloon in the colony is the southern terminal of a railway system extending to the north as far as Hankow in Central China. From Shum-chun on the border of the New Territories northward to Canton the route is now operated by the Canton-Hankow Railway, and is referred to as the southern section of that line. From Shum-chun to Kowloon, a distance representing 36 kilometres out of a total of 183 kilometres from Kowloon to Canton, the railway is operated by the Hong Kong Government and is known as the British section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway. In addition to local services and goods trains, a through passenger service to Canton, a journey, the fastest time of which is 3 hours 55 minutes, is maintained.

Total passengers carried for the year ending 31st March, 1949, amounted to:—Local, 1,477,602; foreign, 2,401,204. Nett receipts totalled $6,076,999.98.

In spite of difficulties of construction, owing to the hilly nature of much of the Colony, and of maintenance, due to summer seasonal downpours of rain, Hong Kong is reasonably well served with roads. Although the total area of the Colony is only 390 square miles, over 400 miles of roads are maintained, 173 miles of which are in the island of Hong Kong, 106 in Kowloon, and the remainder in the New Territories. About 90 per cent. of these roads are of modern metalled construction. Along the length of most of them views of great scenic beauty are to be seen.

A large number of ferry services cross the harbour on various routes connecting the island of Hong Kong with the mainland and with the more important islands. The most frequent service is operated on the shortest harbour crossing between the tip of Kowloon Peninsula and the nearest point on Hong Kong island. A vehicular ferry service is also maintained between Hong Kong island and Kowloon.

There are motorbus services both on Hong Kong island and on the mainland, and an electric tram service is in operation on Hong Kong island from Shaukiwan through the city to Kennedy Town. A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels in addition to the excellent motor road. Rickshaws are still in use, particularly in the city areas.

Shipping

Hong Kong is the principal deep water port in the South China area and in addition to its large ocean shipping trade has an extensive local trade carried on by river steamers and junks within the Canton Delta. It is an important port for British Registry and during the first quarter of 1949, 132 vessels were registered for the first time, constituting an all-time record for the Colony.

Net Tonnage of Vessels using the Port of Hong Kong

| Year Ending | Ocean Vessels | River Steamer | Junk |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|------|
| 31st March, 1947 | 5,306,336     | 606,596       | 848,297 |
| 31st March, 1948 | 7,359,466     | 1,034,008     | 1,242,001 |
| 31st March, 1949 | 8,161,108     | 1,552,333     | 1,364,319 |

It will be observed that these figures all show a progressive increase.

Although passenger services to and from Europe continue to improve, they are still well below the pre-war standards in numbers and frequency. The P. & O. S.N. Co. now operates a fast monthly passenger and cargo service to the United Kingdom and many fast cargo liners of various nationalities now using the port provide excellent accommodation for a limited number of passengers. Passenger services to and from the American continent are provided at regular intervals by vessels under the American flag. Extensive passenger and cargo services to the Straits, parts of the Netherlands East Indies, Burma and India are in the hands of the Indo-China S.N. Co., The British India S.N. Co., The China Navigation Co., and The Royal Interocean Lines amongst others.

Air

Hong Kong is a most important link in the net-work of post-war aviation. Saigon in Indo-China is 5½ hours' flying distance away and Singapore can be reached in 7 hours' flying on the direct route. The journey to Nanking takes 4 hours, Manila in the Philippine Islands is only 4½ hours' journey, and Japan can be reached in one stage by flying boat in 9½ hours.

The decision to build a new airport was announced in May and it is hoped that the main runway will be ready for use in 1952. The site chosen is the most aeronautically suitable in the Colony and it will be possible to build and equip an aerodrome to take all types of aircraft.

Meanwhile the airfield at Kai Tak, situated 4½ miles from the main centre of population, has on the whole successfully handled the large number of aircraft and passengers using it. The air approaches are difficult and consequently delays and diversions have been inevitable in bad weather. Traffic has increased considerably and by the summer of 1949 there were about 100 aircraft each day taking off or landing on international flights. In the twelve months ending 31st July, 1949, 300,000 passengers and 3,500 tons of mail and freight were carried by 22,000 aircraft. Seventy-five per cent. of the passengers travelled to and from China and the remainder to all parts of the world.
Hong Kong is on the British trunk route from the United Kingdom to Tokyo and on the trunk route from U.S.A. to the Far East. There are 16 airlines regularly using the airport and their operations are shown in the following table:

| Company and Aircraft | Nationality | Routes | Weekly Frequency |

Other aviation activities are training—for which the Far East Flying Training School, Ltd., and the Hong Kong Flying Club, Ltd., provide facilities, and maintenance—up to complete overhaul by Jardines Aircraft Maintenance Co., Ltd., and Pacific Air Maintenance and Supply Co., Ltd. The Department of Civil Aviation operates the airport, including telecommunication and air traffic control, examines for all types of aeronautical licences and issues Certificates of Registration and Airworthiness for aircraft.

Postal Services

The large number of scheduled and unscheduled ship and air lines passing through Hong Kong thus enables the Hong Kong Postal Administration to institute excellent mail facilities with other countries throughout the world.

Direct money order services are in operation with Great Britain, Eire, Canada, Burma through India, India, Ceylon, Mauritius, Malaya, British North Borneo, Norfolk Island through Sydney, Australia and New Zealand.
British postal orders are issued and paid at the General Post Office.

Telegraphic money orders are exchanged with the United Kingdom only.

Trade charge money order system is in operation with the United Kingdom and Malaya. Due to the effect of exchange control, it has not been possible to re-open money order services with countries outside the sterling area.

**Telecommunications and Telephones**

Cable and Wireless, Ltd., maintain excellent services by the Hong Kong/Singapore and Hong Kong/Manila cables. The former of these constitutes the main line of communication to the West and South, and as each is capable of slightly more than 2,750,000 groups per year in both directions, there is little danger of the service being overtaxed. The rehabilitation of other cables to the North and South is under active consideration.

Before the war there was also a cable from Hong Kong to Labuan. This cable has now been diverted from Labuan to Jesselton and is in course of rehabilitation.

Cable and Wireless also maintain wireless circuits with the following cities: London, Shanghai, Manila (indirectly to U.S.A.), Singapore, Saigon, Hanoi, Bankgok, Colombo, Chunking, Osaka and Taipeh. It is of interest to note that the London circuit (Hong Kong's second line of communication with the United Kingdom) is relayed automatically by Colombo in order to prolong possible working hours. Radio telephone links are now in operation to Manila, Canton, Macao, Shanghai, San Francisco, Taipeh and London (via Colombo).

Commercial short and medium wave transmitters are housed at Cape d'Aguilar, receivers at Victoria Peak, aeradio and broadcasting transmitters at Hunghom, the broadcasting studio is in the Gloucester Building, and marine receivers at Observatory Wireless Station. The aeradio service control at Kai Tak Airfield covers point-to-point communications, air/ground control, D.F. bearings, meteorological reports. Navigation beacons are situated at Victoria Peak, Hunghom, d'Aguilar and Waglan lighthouse. V.H.F. systems are utilised by the Police Department and Harbour Office.

Broadcasting transmissions cover a minimum period of 6½ hours daily in each of two programmes, English and Chinese. The transmitters are not sufficiently powerful to be readily heard outside the limits of Hong Kong territory but the local popularity of the programmes is indicated by the remarkable increase in the number of receiving licences which on 31st August, 1949, was over 38,000.

Call signals are as follows:

- **VPS** for marine, 500 k/cs.
- For commercial services, as in Berne lists.
- **ZBW** medium wave, European Broadcasting, 845 k/cs.
- **ZEK** medium wave, Chinese Broadcasting, 640 k/cs.
- **ZBW3** short wave, 2 k/w, 9·525 m/cs. shared by ZBW and ZEK.

An automatic telephone service is provided by the Hong Kong Telephone Co., Ltd. By 31st August, 1949, over 18,000 direct exchange lines were in operation and the company's plans envisage a total of 28,000 lines as soon as the necessary trained staff and equipment are available.

**PUBLIC FINANCE**

Up to and including 1939, the Colony's financial year coincided with the calendar year, but thereafter the financial year was changed to the twelve months ending on the 31st March.

| Period       | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1938         | $36,735,854 | $37,175,897 |
| 1939         | $41,478,052 | $37,949,116 |
| 1940-41 (15 months) | $70,175,114 | $64,787,556 |
| 1941-42 (estimates) | $56,786,000 | $60,642,715 |
| 1942-46*     |           |             |
| 1946-47 (11 months) | $82,141,556 | $85,624,391 |
| 1947-48      | $164,298,310 | $127,701,174 |
| 1948-49      | $194,933,955 | $159,954,023 |

The major sources of revenue are Duties, Earnings and Profits Tax and Assessed Taxes (Rates).

There is no general customs tariff in Hong Kong, import duties being confined to liquor, tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, toilet preparations and proprietary medicines and table waters. A special foreign registration fee of 20 per cent. of the value of a motor vehicle is payable in respect of any vehicle not produced within the British Empire. Earnings and Profits Tax comprises a tax on income from property, salaries, profits and interest, the standard rate being 10 per cent. Rates varying from 15 to 17 per cent. are charged on the annual value of property.

These measures between them accounted for total revenue of approximately $97 million (over £6 million) in 1948-49.

**Public Debt**

The Public Debt of the Colony as at the 31st March, 1949, totalled $69,016,000 comprising four issues:

(a) 4 per cent. Conversion Loan raised in 1933 and repayable not later than the 31st August, 1953—$4,838,000.

(b) 3½ per cent. Dollar Loan raised in 1934—$6,160,000.

(c) 3½ per cent. Dollar Loan raised in 1940—$8,018,000.

(d) 3½ per cent. Rehabilitation Loan, 1973-78—$50,000,000.

(a) Redeemable by Sinking Fund, which is fully invested and amounted at the 31st March, 1949, to £220,551 10s.

(b) and (c) are redeemable by 25 annual drawings which were suspended during the occupation of the Colony but have since been brought up to date.

(d) This loan was raised in January, 1948, and the Sinking Fund at 31st March, 1949, amounted to £32,004 3s. 4d.

**TRADE**

The following table shows the value of the Colony's imports and exports during 1948 and gives the corresponding figures for 1938-1940 and 1946-1947:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
|      | millions of $ | millions of $ |
| 1938 | 618·2 | 511·9 |
| 1939 | 594·2 | 533·4 |
| 1940 | 752·7 | 621·8 |
| 1946 | 935·5 | 765·6 |
| 1947 | 1,549·9 | 1,216·8 |
| 1948 | 2,077·5 | 1,582·7 |

*Occupied by the Japanese, followed by a period of British Military Administration up to 30th April, 1946.*
The increase shown in the post-war figures does not necessarily represent an increase in the volume of commodities handled, since the value of all goods was very much greater than the value of similar goods before the war. It is, however, estimated that a volume of trade equivalent to the volume of pre-war trade was handled in 1947, and the figures for 1948 show a further increase in both imports and exports, which raises the volume of trade above the pre-war figures.

The most noteworthy feature of 1948 was a great increase of trade with the United Kingdom. Trade with the United States continued to improve and—in spite of the deterioration of the situation in that country—trade with China was decidedly better than it had been in 1947.

**Currency and Banking**

The unit of currency in the Colony is the Hong Kong dollar. Until 1935 it was based on the Mexican Silver Dollar and the British Silver Dollar, and considerable fluctuation occurred until the silver standard was abandoned. As from 5th December, 1935, under the Currency Ordinance 1935, an Exchange Fund was established and it was provided that the note issuing Banks, namely the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Mercantile Bank of India, should surrender to the Fund all silver previously deposited against note issues, and should deposit full sterling cover for all notes issued thereafter. Since 1935 the value of the Hong Kong dollar has been maintained both before and after the Japanese occupation at approximately one shilling and threepence.

Notes of denominations from five dollar upwards are issued by the note issuing banks, and the Government issues notes of one dollar, ten cents, five cents and one cent, and coins of 10 cents in nickel brass.

The colony is included in the sterling bloc and the authorised banks for dealing in foreign exchange are, in addition to the three note-issuing banks mentioned above—

- Thomas Cook and Sons, Ltd.
- Chase Bank.
- National City Bank of New York, Inc.
- American Express Co., Inc.
- Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank.
- Netherlands Trading Society.
- Banque Belge pour l'Etranger.
- Banque de l'Indo-Chine.
- Bank of China.
- Bank of Communications.
- Bank of Canton.
- Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank.
- Bank of East Asia.
- Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation.
- Chinese Postal Remittances and Savings Bank.
- Farmers Bank of China.
- China and South Seas Bank.
- Bank of Kwangsi.
- Young Bros. Banking Corporation.
- National Commercial and Saving Bank, Ltd.
- The Central Trust of China.

In addition to these incorporated banks, there are in the colony many Chinese banks which handle a considerable volume of remittances from Chinese living overseas to their relations in China.

In January, 1948, the Banking Ordinance, 1948, was passed according to which no company may carry on banking business without being licensed.

Further information about Hong Kong will be found in the Annual Report of the Colony and the Annual Departmental Reports.
