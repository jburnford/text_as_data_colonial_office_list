FEDERATION OF MALAYA

SITUATION AND AREA

The territories comprising the Federation of Malaya are situated in the southern section of the Kra Peninsula, which protrudes at the southeastern corner of Asia between India and China, between latitudes 1° and 7° N. and longitudes 100° and 105° E. The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,850 square miles, rather more than twice the size of the island of Ceylon, and slightly larger than England without Wales. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang, which is twice the area of Lancashire and Yorkshire combined, and the smallest is the State of Perlis, which is about twice the size of Rutland.

The State of Perlis lies on the north-west coast of the Peninsula and is bounded by a range of mountains running north and south, which separates it from the Siamese province of Setul. On the east the boundary is with the Siamese province of Nakon Sridhammaraj and the Malay State of Kedah, which is bordered on the interior by the Siamese States of Songkla and Patani and by the State of Perak. The Muda River separates it from Province Wellesley.

The State of Perak stretches south from Province Wellesley, Kedah and Siam and is separated from Kelantan and Pahang on the east by the main range of mountains that form the backbone of the Peninsula. On the south, the Bernam River separates the State from Selangor, which is bordered on the east by the State of Pahang and on the south by the State of Negri Sembilan.

Stretching north on the east coast between the northern border of Pahang and the Siamese boundary lie the two States of Trengganu and Kelantan.

In the extreme south of the Malay Peninsula lies the State of Johore. Four-fifths of the surface of the Peninsula is covered by dense tropical jungle. The only generally cleared parts of the country are the long stretches down the west coast, an area in the north and a number of open stretches up the principal rivers. The State of Trengganu, for example, is divided into sixteen river basins, all of which empty into the China Sea.

**CLIMATE**

The principal features of the Malayan climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and uniform temperature. The year is commonly divided into south-west and north-east monsoon seasons, which correspond roughly with the summer and winter of Northern latitudes. The months between these two seasons, which correspond with spring and autumn of Northern latitudes, are the wettest months over most parts of Malaya. Coastal districts, however, have their own peculiar rainy seasons.

Rainfall averages about 100 inches a year, though the annual fall varies considerably from place to place and year to year. Jelebu, in Negri Sembilan, is the driest place in Malaya with an average of 65 inches and Maxwell’s Hill the wettest with 198 inches a year.

The average maximum temperature in the plains is rather less than 90° F., and minimum about 70° F. At hill stations temperatures are considerably lower; at Cameron Highlands the extreme temperatures recorded are 79° F. and 36° F. and at Fraser’s Hill 81° F. and 53° F.

The nights are reasonably cool everywhere, and although the days are frequently hot and, on account of the high humidity, somewhat oppressive, it very rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not obtained at night. The effect of the heat and humidity is, however, cumulative, and after a few years a change to a more bracing climate becomes imperative if health is to be maintained.

The highest temperature recorded during 1948 was 97° F., which occurred at several places on various dates. The lowest temperature recorded in the plains was 65° F. at Kuantan on 18th December and at Jelebu on 17th September.

**GENERAL DESCRIPTION**

The Kra Peninsula is divided by mountain ranges, the principal trend of which is north and south. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country, while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains, which are mainly alluvial, and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80 per cent. of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp, 14 per cent. under rubber, 2·4 per cent. under padi and 2·1 per cent. under coconuts and oil palms.

The Malay rivers at their sources and in their upper reaches are quick flowing, often with tortuous rapids and precipitous gorges.

In the lower reaches, the descent is more gradual and the water takes on a muddy hue from contamination with the silt of the plains through which they meander, debouching ultimately through strips of mangrove swamp, particularly on the west coast.

The two principal rivers of the Peninsula are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter being some ten miles shorter than the River Thames. It springs in the main range of mountains, the highest of which is Gunong Tahan, which rises to over 7,000 feet at its summit. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory south of the Himalayas, while there are half a dozen prominencies which would comfortably overshadow Ben Nevis. That part of the country free from the torrid luxuriance of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other stretches have been scarred by the incisions of industry as in the Kinta Valley of Perak, which opens out into a monotonous prospect of silver-grey silt, the residuum of tin extraction.

The coast-line of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west lies a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat, with infrequent indentations of picturesque bays fringed with coconut palms and the graceful spires of the casuarina. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand and surf bordered by a littoral vegetation which lends to it a beauty possibly unparalleled in the tropics.

Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands off the North Kedah coast rising to over 2,000 feet wrapped in wild and rugged beauty. Farther south there is the island of Penang, picturesque in a different way, whose features have been eulogised by travellers from the earliest histories. The island of Pangkor off the coast of Perak was once a Dutch settlement, but little remains in evidence of this history beneath the vegetation, which has long since reclaimed its own.

Finally, off the east coast among a sprinkle of beautiful islands there is Tioman with its symbolic silhouette of granite peaks.

**POPULATION**

The most recent census, taken on the 23rd September, 1947, showed a total population (excluding transients) of 4,908,086, including 29,648 nomadic aborigines. This represented an increase of 29·6 per cent. since the 1931 census. The Federation is 50,600 square miles in area and the mean population density in September, 1947, was therefore approximately 97 per square mile. The Indian population has dropped since 1931, partly as the result of the ban imposed by the Government of India on emigration from India to Malaya of unskilled labourers, but chiefly because of abnormally high death rates and low birth rates during the Japanese occupation. The indigenous Malay population has increased, and so has the Chinese. The highest percentage increase is that of the Chinese (46·7 per cent.). The Malays outnumber the Chinese in the country as a whole, but Chinese outnumber the Malays in the Settlement of Penang and in the Malay States of Selangor, Perak, Negri Sembilan, and Johore. Almost half the total Malay population is contained in the three Malay States of Kedah, Kelantan and Trengganu, where Malays outnumber all the other races.

The following figures show comparative increases and decreases since 1931, by race:

|          | Malaysians | Chinese | Indians | Others |
|----------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1931     | 1,863,872 | 1,284,888 | 570,987 | 68,011 |
| 1947     | 2,427,834 | 1,884,534 | 530,638 | 65,080 |
Population of the main towns of the Federation in September, 1947, was as follows:

- George Town (Penang) ........................................... 189,068
- Kuala Lumpur (Selangor) ........................................ 175,961
- Ipoh (Perak) .......................................................... 80,894
- Malacca (Malacca) .................................................. 54,507
- Taiping (Perak) ....................................................... 41,361
- Johore Bahru (Johore) .............................................. 38,826

- Klang (Selangor) ..................................................... 33,506
- Alor Star (Kedah) .................................................... 32,424
- Bandar Maharani (Johore) ......................................... 32,228
- Kuala Trengganu (Trengganu) .................................... 27,004
- Bandar Penggaram (Perak) ........................................ 26,306
- Telok Anson (Perak) ................................................ 23,055
- Kota Bharu (Kelantan) ............................................. 22,765

RELIGION

The Muslim religion is practised by the Malays, who are Sunni Muslims of the Shafi'i School. The Malay Rulers are the titular religious heads of their Muslim subjects in each State. The Muslim community also includes a number of the local Indian population and a lesser number of persons of other races.

There are Christian churches in most of the larger towns of Malaya and the Christian community includes an appreciable number of local Asians.

Hinduism is the religion of the majority of the Indian labourers and of a large number of the local Indian population of all classes, including the Chettiaris.

Buddhism is practised by a section of the Chinese and Indian communities and by the small Siamese groups. The Sikh community follow the religious belief of that name.

Amongst the Chinese population may be found a variety of beliefs which include Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, with the addition of the worship of a number of local deities.

Little is known of the beliefs of the primitive aboriginal tribes of the interior, but they are said to practise forms of Shamanism and Animism.

HISTORY

European power in Malaya may be dated from 1511, when a Portuguese fleet captured Malacca; it succeeded to periods of Indian and Islamic influence. Indian traders from the Coromandel coast, arriving in the Peninsula in about the first century A.D., found the aboriginal inhabitants living by fishing and the most primitive agriculture. The Indians, beginning to settle in the country and intermarry with the aborigines, built the first towns; the chief one, which stood on the River Merbok in Kedah, was known in Malay records as Langkasuka. Eventually there emerged an Indo-Malayan kingdom called Sri-Vijaya, of which the capital was at one time at Palembang in Sumatra, but may later have been at Langkasuka. This Indian influence, which had replaced the aboriginal tribal organisation by the rule of Rajas, had disseminated Buddhism, and had added to the Malay language a large number of Sanskrit words, together with the Indian alphabets, lasted until about the fifteenth century, when Muslim missionaries began to undermine it. Indians, Persians and Arabians, they had come to Sumatra a century earlier, and soon spread to the Peninsula.

By the seventeenth century Indian culture and religion had yielded to those of Islam; the Arabic alphabet was introduced, Arabic words came into the language, and Indian aesthetics gave place to Muslim austerity. A great part in this process was played by Iskander Muda, Sultan of Aceh.

In northern Sumatra, whose piratical hordes swept through Malaya, massacring and pillaging, and at the same time compelling conversion to Islam at the point of the sword. Meanwhile European power was beginning. The Portuguese in Malacca succeeded a Malay kingdom which, founded by a dispossessed ruler of Tumasik (the modern Singapore), had extended its sway over much of the peninsula. They held Malacca from 1511 to 1641, when they were dispossessed by the Dutch.

The Portuguese were crusaders even more than traders, and made themselves detested by the Malays by their compulsory conversions to Christianity. In contrast, the Dutch concerned themselves almost entirely with trade during their 150 years of rule in Malacca, jealously guarding their monopoly of the tin and spice trades. But neither the Portuguese nor the Dutch extended their rule beyond the town of Malacca. It was to break the Dutch trading monopoly that the British first settled in Malaya. Francis Light, in 1786, obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795, during the Napoleonic wars; it served as a base for the successful attack on Dutch Java by Lord Minto and Sir Stamford Raffles. Raffles became Lieutenant-Governor of Java; but in 1814 Java and Malacca alike were handed back to the Dutch. Raffles, with his far-seeing vision, held this to be a grave mistake, and by continued representations to the company secured permission to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. He obtained a concession from the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore, and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. Raffles' vision was proved not only by his choice of a site, but by his determination to make it a free port. With these two advantages Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the Entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands as the third of the Straits Settlements in 1824, when by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London Malaya was recognised as a British sphere of influence. Raffles strongly favoured British expansion in Malaya; but after his early death in 1826 the parsimonious conservatism of the East India Company frowned on such a policy. However, in 1858 the Straits Settlements came under the control of the India Office, and in 1867 of the Colonial Office, while such factors as the danger to the British position latent in the huge concessions of land granted at this time by the Sultans to Europeans and others, the growing interest in the tin, and subsequently rubber, which could be obtained from Malaya, and a deterioration of the political situation of the Malay States into civil war and disorder, hastened the extension of British authority in the Peninsula. In 1873 Sir Andrew Clarke, the new Governor of the Straits, came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan, and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam, after long negotiations, transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern states, and there resulted agreements in the same year with Kedah, Kelantan and Perlis, and in 1919 with Trengganu. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914.
All these treaties were in their main features similar: the Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in return guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each state a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the rulers agreed to follow on all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The early residents were faced with great difficulties. The new methods of raising revenue which became necessary to finance the development of the country aroused great hostility, to which the forbidding of slavery and of forced labour added. There were risings in Perak in 1874 and in Pahang in 1891-1892. In time, however, the residents, by patience and conciliation, overcame these difficulties; and the foundations laid by such early residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories of the Colonial Empire. Politically, the main change in the early years of the century was the formation of the Federated Malay States. Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a federation with a resident general as chief executive officer, and a system of centralised government was inaugurated which lasted in varying forms until 1932. In that year there was a measure of decentralisation; legislative powers were to some extent restored to the states and the authority of the rulers and residents was reinforced.

Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt halt during Japanese occupation from December, 1941, to August, 1945.

During the period of British military administration Sir Harold MacMichael negotiated with Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers new agreements under which they transferred full sovereignty and jurisdiction to His Majesty the King, thereby opening the way for the establishment of the Malayan Union by Order in Council on 1st April, 1946. It had been planned at the same time to establish a form of common citizenship, but, in view of the strong objections put forward by the Malays to the form of these proposals, the Order in Council which would have given effect to them was not made. The Malays also objected to the transfer of sovereignty, and feared domination by the non-Malay communities as a result of the proposed new citizenship. On 25th July, 1946, a working committee, consisting of representatives of Government, of Their Highnesses the Rulers, and of the United Malays' National Organisation, was appointed to submit agreed views, if possible, for both sides to examine and criticise. Its Report, published in December, 1946, recommended a federation in which each state and settlement would retain its individuality under a strong central government; and qualifications for a form of common citizenship. These proposals received the conditional approval of His Majesty's Government on 11th December, 1946. To enable all interested communities to have free and full opportunity of expressing their views a Consultative Committee was appointed, composed mainly of influential members of the non-Malay communities. After receiving oral and written representations throughout the country the Consultative Committee published its report on 31st March, 1947. After further discussion with Their Highnesses the Rulers and the representatives of U.M.N.O., the scheme which finally emerged, and which followed in the main that proposed in December, 1946, although differing on several important points of detail, was finally accepted by His Majesty's Government in July, 1947, when its main features were summarised in a White Paper (Cmd. 7171). The signature of agreements between His Majesty and each Malay Ruler, and of a Federation Agreement to embrace the arrangements as a whole, followed on 21st January, 1948, and the new Constitution came into force on 1st February, 1948.

CONSTITUTION

The Federation of Malaya, which succeeded the Malayan Union, came into being on 1st February, 1948, on the conclusion of the Federation of Malaya Agreement between His Majesty the King and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the nine Malay States of Johore, Pahang, Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Trengganu and the two British settlements of Penang and Malacca. His Majesty the King and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Malay States have power to admit any other territory into the Federation by mutual agreement. Under the Federation Agreement there is a Conference of Rulers, which is consulted on matters of special concern to the Malay States and in particular on immigration policy.

The Central Government, which was set up under the Federation Agreement, and to which legislation on matters of importance to the whole country is reserved, consists of a High Commissioner appointed by His Majesty, a Federal Executive Council, and a Federal Legislative Council. The Legislative Council consists of 75 members: 14 official and ex officio, the 9 Mentri Besar or chief ministers of the Malay States, 2 representing the Settlement Councils, and 50 unofficial, these last nominated on a mainly non-racial basis to represent important vocations and interests. New legislation is enacted jointly by the High Commissioner and Their Highnesses the Rulers. The new provisions concerning citizenship are summarized in Cmd. 7171.

Each State is governed under a written Constitution by its Ruler assisted by a State Executive Council and a Council of State, and each Settlement has a Settlement Council. His Majesty the King, through the High Commissioner, exercises control over questions of defence and external relations.

The Federation Agreement also records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress shall be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as circumstances permit for the election of members to the several legislatures established under the Agreement.

ADMINISTRATION

Under the Federal constitution the executive authority in each State is vested in the Ruler, who is aided and advised by his Executive Council; it extends to all matters not included in the Federal legislative list. The Councils of State and the Settlement Councils have legislative powers in such matters as are not reserved for the Federal authority. The Federal estimates provide separately for the income and expenditure of each of the States and Settlements, and for block grants from Federal revenue to make up the deficiency of their own revenues.
The seat of the Federal Government is at Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of most Federal Departments and of the Military Command (Malaya District). In each state there is a British Adviser as adviser to the State Government and officers of the various Federal departments who, while being responsible to the heads of their own departments, work closely with State officers. Most of the administrative officers in districts are Asians trained in Malaya.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Rehabilitation of the educational system is practically complete and the problem is now how to provide for the tremendous expansion which will be needed to cope with the post-war urge for education of all kinds. There are already, in schools of all kinds, 581,000 pupils as compared with 263,000 in 1941.

Primary education is given in Malay, Chinese and Indian vernacular schools, of which there are 3,650. In the Malay schools no fees are charged and attendance is compulsory for boys; there has been a notable increase in the number of girls attending schools. Chinese schools are mainly conducted by Committees of the Chinese community following a typical Chinese Vernacular syllabus. The enrolment in Chinese vernacular schools is 208,000. Chinese schools are visited by Government inspectors, who report whether they are of the standard of efficiency required to qualify them for a Government grant. Indian schools are mostly on estates, supervised by the estate Managers; they have since 1948 received generous grants which include teachers' salaries on approved scales.

English schools, that is, schools where English is the medium of instruction, are mostly secondary in scope, though many have primary schools attached. Pupils of all races are admitted, some directly, and some from vernacular schools, in many cases without fees being required, and receive education up to School Certificate standard. The Malay College at Kuala Kangsar and the Malay Girls' College at Kuala Lumpar are residential schools following the secondary school curriculum of the English schools.

Higher education in Malaya which hitherto has been provided by Raffles College and the King Edward VII College of Medicine, both at Singapore, is now provided by the University of Malaya, which embraces the two Singapore Colleges. The University was formally constituted on 8th October, 1949. Also various scholarships are available for selected students to study in the United Kingdom. In the Federation, the Technical College at Kuala Lumpur provides a three-year course in various types of engineering, and the College of Agriculture at Serdang provides courses in agriculture, with special reference to local problems.

Malay vernacular teachers are trained at the Sultan Idris Training College, and at the Malacca Women's Training College. Extensive training schemes have been formed to relieve the serious shortage of teachers.

**Information Services**

Since the liberation of Malaya, a Department of Public Relations has been established, charged with responsibility for the presentation of accurate factual information regarding Government policy to the people of Malaya.

Diversities of race, language, religion and custom, together with the illiteracy of the majority of the population, present difficulties. The Department makes considerable use of mobile public address and cinema units as a method of reaching rural audiences. More than 2,220,000 people were addressed in 1948. Simple publications in Malay, English, Chinese and Tamil have begun the bridging of the gap between the publication of Government Enactments in English and their understanding by the local people. Pioneer work has been done in conjunction with the Trade Union Adviser's Department in preparing simple pamphlets in vernacular languages on trades unionism and allied matters of importance to the workers.

Publicity in connection with the Emergency has been undertaken by the Department on a considerable scale.

**Health**

The climate of Malaya is healthy but monotonously warm, with a high humidity.

The general health of the country has greatly improved in the last two years and is almost at pre-war level.

The latest developments in the treatment and prophylaxis of important tropical diseases such as malaria and tropical typhus are closely followed and put into practice.

The post-war increase in the incidence of tuberculosis has given rise to schemes to combat this disease. Epidemic smallpox is now under control and practically eradicated. Sixty-five General and District Hospitals, in which 13,500 beds are provided, are maintained by Government, as well as institutions for persons suffering from leprosy, mental diseases, infectious diseases; also V.D. clinics and dental clinics. One hundred and sixty-two private hospitals with 6,637 beds are maintained on rubber estates. In the larger towns, housing shortage is a serious problem and water supplies are treated according to modern methods. Sewage disposal by domestic septic tanks is the practice in use in suburban areas, but conservancy methods are a feature of the built-up areas. Malaria is controlled in towns and villages by anti-larval methods.

The treatment of the rural population is carried out by means of fixed and travelling dispensaries and welfare clinics. 2,558,764 patients were treated either as out-patients or in-patients during 1948.

Child Welfare Centres are established in all the densely populated parts of the country.

The Institute for Medical Research deals with a wide range of investigations, amongst which those on tropical typhus, malaria and nutritional problems are the most prominent.

**Labour**

The year 1948 was a very momentous one in the history of labour in Malaya. Despite a general upward trend in wages and a steady fall in the cost of living, there was, during the early months of the year, a good deal of incipient unrest.

The second quarter produced a crescendo of strikes, particularly on the larger estates, where conditions of employment were amongst the best in the country. Most of these strikes were started and maintained by intimidation. The demands put forward clearly indicated central direction and
it became obvious that the unrest was Communist-inspired. It transpired, however, that there was a distinct limit to the number of strikes which these subversive elements could maintain at one time. In their efforts to sustain the maximum number of strikes, they dispersed their forces over a very wide field and, as a result, were unable to maintain sufficient pressure by way of intimidation to keep them all going.

Towards the end of May the Communist-dominated Pan-Malayan Federation of Trade Unions and its satellites began to sense an increasing unwillingness on the part of the worker to assist in furthering their subversive aims. At the same time legislation was introduced which was designed to loosen the Communist grip on the Trade Union movement. Convinced that their power to use the masses in order to disrupt the economy of the country was fast disappearing, the Communist Trade Union leaders and their followers took to the jungle and resorted to the method of armed banditry. A state of emergency was declared, existing strikes rapidly terminated, and after June there was practically no further industrial unrest. Employer-employee relations progressively improved and industrial output increased appreciably, despite continued terrorist activities.

Welfare

The Department of Social Welfare has rapidly developed its technical services and has expanded its work in the rural areas. Training Courses for officers and local recruits to the service are producing excellent results. The scope of the voluntary organisations has widened and much has been done towards their co-ordination.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

The road system of Malaya is 6,060 miles in length and is composed of the following mileages and types of road:

| Class | Description                  | Mileage |
|-------|------------------------------|---------|
| A     | Concrete surface             | 20      |
|       | Metalled surface, grouted or sealed with bitumen | 3,917   |
| B     | Metalled surface, waterbound | 337     |
| C     | Hard surface, bitumen sealed | 212     |
| D     | Hard surface, waterbound     | 849     |
| E     | Earth surface                | 725     |

Approximately 2,120 miles of roads have been declared as "Federal" roads and funds for their maintenance are provided for by the Federal Government. Federal roads, in general, include all the main through routes, roads serving the principal ports, roads in a stage of preliminary development and roads which could be said to be principally of strategic value.

The remaining 3,940 miles of roads are maintained by the respective Governments of the States or Settlements in which the roads are situated.

About 640 miles of road were resurfaced during 1948, and the programme of replacement of bridges destroyed during the Malayan campaign was continued.

The expenditure on maintenance of the 5,335 miles of metalled roads amounted to $17,544,000 giving an average cost of $3,288 per mile.

Rail

The railway system which is government-owned serves Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. The track is of metre-gauge. From Singapore Island the railway crosses to the mainland by the Johore Causeway. The main line then runs roughly parallel to the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula, but at some distance inland, to Prai on the west coast, opposite the Island of Penang. This main west coast line is 488 miles long. From Bukit Mertajam (5 miles south of Prai), a line branches off the main line and continues in a northerly direction to the Siamese frontier at Padang Besar, the junction with the Royal State Railways of Siam, 99 miles from Bukit Mertajam. Lines branch from the main line to serve railway-operated ports at Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson and Port Weld. A branch line, 22 miles long, which connected the port of Malacca with the main line, was removed by the Japanese during their 3½ years of occupation, and has not yet been replaced.

The East Coast Line branches from the main line at Gemas, 137 miles from Singapore, and runs in a northerly direction through the States of Negri Sembilan, Pahang and Kelantan, and terminates at the port of Tumpat on the east coast close to the Siamese border. The distance from Gemas to Tumpat is 327 miles. At Pasir Mas, 16 miles south of Tumpat, a branch line 13 miles long runs west to connect with the Royal State Railways of Siam at the border station of Sungei Golok.

The Japanese removed a length of 200 miles of the East Coast Line between Mentakab (Pahang) and Krai (Kelantan). The restoration work on the 17 miles between Sungei Kusial and Krai was completed and the section was opened for traffic on 8th September, 1948. This work included the restoration of the Guillemand and Sungei Nai bridges. The relaying operations northwards from Mentakab were continued with the specially constructed track-laying train using prefabricated track. On 15th April, 1948 the section from Mentakab to Kuala Krau was completed and on 3rd November, 1948, the section from Mentakab to Jerantut was completed. The distance from Mentakab to Jerantut is 32 miles. Relaying northwards from Jerantut has been suspended temporarily.

A through service is run once a week between Prai and Bangkok, the Siamese capital.

A twice weekly service is also maintained between Prai and Tumpat in Kelantan via the Siamese Southern Line Padang Besar–Sungei Golok, but this service has been temporarily suspended in view of the present state of emergency in Malaya.

Buffet cars and sleeping saloons are provided on the night mail trains between Prai and Singapore, and one air-conditioned buffet car is attached to the Kuala Lumpur–Prai day mail on alternate days.

First class fares are at the rate of 12½ cents per mile.

Shipping

Due to the policy of decentralisation under the New Constitution, the sphere of direct administration of the Marine Department of the Federation of Malaya has been reduced and is now confined to the Marine Departments of Penang, Malacca and Port Swettenham. The Department is also responsible for the maintenance and improvement
of all navigational aids around the coasts of the Federation and for the dredging of harbours and approaches.

In the States of Perak, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Kedah, Johore, Trengganu and Kelantan, the Marine Superintendent acts in an advisory capacity to the State Governments on marine affairs.

Navigational aids around the Federation coast have been improved and maintained in a state of efficiency. Complete new electrical light house equipment for Pulau Angsa, North Klang Strait, arrived from the United Kingdom and is now in operation, together with a new light ship for Angsa Bank.

With the installation of these two important up-to-date aids, mariners will have little difficulty in making the North approach to Klang Strait.

The clearing of wrecks and the subsequent dredging programmes are proceeding satisfactorily.

Shipping has improved generally and no reaction has been felt from the emergency. Wartime restrictions have now disappeared and services are running under conditions of normal peacetime commerce.

Direct services between Federation ports and the United Kingdom are provided by the Peninsular and Oriental, Blue Funnel, Glen and Shire, and East Asiatic Company Lines.

The following figures for Penang, Port Swettenham, Malacca and Teluk Anson were recorded in 1948:

| No. of Vessels | Tons       |
|----------------|------------|
| Penang         | 2,969      |
| Port Swettenham| 1,764      |
| Malacca        | 484        |
|                | 5,217      |
|                | 13,348,496 |

Country Craft

The total number of country craft that entered and cleared Federation ports was as follows:

| No. of Vessels | Tons       |
|----------------|------------|
| Penang         | 7,334      |
| Port Swettenham| 7,061      |
| Malacca        | 6,675      |
|                | 21,070     |
|                | 758,667    |

Air

The International Airline Operating Companies which include B.O.A.C., Qantas and K.L.M., provide scheduled services between Singapore and the continents of Europe and Australia. In addition, air services connect Singapore with capitals in the Netherlands East Indies, Siam, French Indo-China, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Burma, India and Ceylon.

Malaya is provided with a very efficient domestic air service operated by Malayan Airways, Ltd., who, in addition to running daily services between Singapore and centres in the Federation, operate frequent schedules to Sarawak and N. Borneo and to points in the N.E.I. and Siam.

Projected services in South-East Asia which will affect Malaya include routes from Singapore to Shanghai (via Bangkok and Hong Kong) and to Manila via Borneo.

Although modern aerodromes, telecommunications and navigational aid equipment are still in short supply, the air routes at present being operated in this region are provided with the minimum ground organisation required to maintain the safe operation of all these services.

The international and domestic air services operating through Malaya have surpassed considerably the services available to the general public at the outbreak of the last war, and they will increase and expand still further during the coming year.

The completion of the new International Airport at Tengah will go far towards enabling Singapore to maintain its position as a focal point of trade communications in South East Asia.

Posts

The former postal services of the States have been unified into one postal Administration for the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore. There is rapid and reliable delivery by postmen and increasing use is being made of the internal air services.

Telecommunications

The Telecommunications Department, Malaya is a pan-Malayan Department serving the Federation of Malaya and the Colony of Singapore, except in so far as the local telephone services of Singapore and Johore Bahru are concerned which are operated by a private company.

There are telegraph services throughout Malaya and links with Cable and Wireless, Ltd. There are over 200 telephone exchanges throughout the Peninsula.

The re-establishment of radio telephone links between Malaya and the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries is in hand and the first-named service will probably commence in 1950.

Subsidiary services such as teleprinters on the lines of "Telex" exist and certain V.H.F. links between points where normal land line cannot be used have been established.

Broadcasting

The Federation of Malaya is at present served by broadcasting stations located at Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca, radiating programmes in the English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil languages on medium wave. These stations originate mainly entertainment programmes and talks of local interest. Each station relays the news bulletin, special features and talks, and school broadcasts radiated on shortwave over the whole of the Peninsula by the main transmitters of the Department of Broadcasting located in Singapore. A 5 K.W. shortwave transmitter will be in operation from Kuala Lumpur before the end of 1949 and two 10 K.W. medium wave transmitters should be in operation from Kuala Lumpur early in 1950. The installation of these transmitters will give wider coverage of Malaya from the Federation's capital, and it is the ultimate aim of the Department to give good medium wave listening to all the main centres of population in Malaya.

And for every further addition of 50 cents or part thereof. | 25

(c) Estate Duty

Estate duty is collected under the Estate Duty (Transitional Provision) Ordinance, 1946.

The rates of Estate Duty form a graduated scale rising from 1 per cent. to 40 per cent. according to the aggregate value of all the property liable to duty on death.

The total amount of Estate Duty collected in the year 1948 was $1,801,229.

(d) Stamp Duties

Stamp Duties are collected under the various Stamp Enactments of the former Federated and Unfederated Malay States and Straits Settlements, and in some cases vary between States and Settlements. An ordinance to unify stamp duties is at present being drafted and will be introduced in the near future.

The total revenue from stamp duties was $4,099,644 for 1948.

Under the Stamp Enactments of the Federated Malay States and Straits Settlements a tax of 10 per cent. is imposed on all bets made on a totalisator or pari-mutual of any turf club and 10 per cent. on all sweepstakes run by a turf club on the result of any race.

(e) Licences

The rates for various licences such as pawnshops, spirit and toddy shops, and dogs vary in the different States and Settlements. The main source of revenue from licences is that for motor vehicles which amounted to $6,739,725 during 1948. The licences of motor vehicles are based on horse power and type of engine and vary according to whether the vehicle is for private, public or load carrying purposes.

(f) Municipal

Municipal Revenue amounting to $5,777,755 consists of general assessment rates, specific fees and charge for services in Town Board areas. The municipal revenue in the municipal areas of Penang and Malacca is collected by the Municipal Commissioners and is not in Federation of Malaya Revenue.

(g) Income Tax

The Income Tax Ordinance, 1947 (No. 48 of 1947) was brought into force on the 1st January, 1948, and the 1st January, 1948 was appointed as the date of commencement of the first year of assessment. In July, 1948, an amending bill designed to give effect to the recommendations of an Income Tax Joint Committee was introduced into the Legislative Council and was enacted as the Income Tax (Amendment) Ordinance, No. 11 of 1948. The amendment of the legislation prevented the work of assessment and collection being commenced before the last quarter of the year, and it was not possible for the return forms to be issued until November, 1948. By the 31st December, 1948, approximately $2,300,000 had been collected, but, on the basis of the latest information available, the yield of tax for the year of assessment 1948 is estimated to be between $23,000,000 and $25,000,000. The yield for 1949 is expected to be approximately the same.

Owing to the close economic relations existing between the Federation and the Colony of Singapore it was considered essential that the tax should be operated on a pan-Malayan basis. The Federation and the Colony Ordinances are, therefore in all but a few minor respects, identical, and it is provided that a taxpayer resident in either territory shall make one return of his combined income from the Federation and from the Colony, and that only one assessment shall be made on his income. The net proceeds of the tax in such cases will, in due course, be allocated between the two Governments.
The Colonial Income Tax Office in London act as agents for the Federation Income Tax Department, and assess and collect the tax payable by companies and individuals resident in the United Kingdom who elect to make their returns to the London Office.

Currency and Banking

The legal currency of the Federation of Malaya is the Malayan dollar which is on the Sterling Exchange Standard fixed at the value of 2s. 4d. per dollar. It is governed by the various State Currency Enactments.

The currency in circulation consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
(a) The Straits Settlements Currency Commissioners.
(b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya.

(ii) Bank Notes issued prior to 1st October, 1923 by—
(a) The Chartered Bank of India Australia and China.
(b) The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.

(iii) Silver dollars and half dollars.
(iv) Subsidiary silver coin.
(v) Nickel coin (5-cent pieces).
(vi) Copper coin.
(vii) Bronze coin.

(i) and (ii) above consist of notes in the following denominations:—$10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1, and subsidiary notes 50 cents, 25 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. The total nominal currency note circulation on 31st December, 1948, was $400,938,886.

Silver dollars, half dollars, subsidiary silver coin and nickel coin have almost entirely disappeared from circulation and no further issues of such coin are being made. Cupro-nickel coin in denominations of 20, 10 and 5 cents is now being minted.

Copper coin consists of denominations of 1-cent, ½-cent, and ¼-cent pieces.

Bronze coin consists of 1-cent and ½-cent pieces. The total nominal circulation of coins on 31st December, 1948, was $6,506,124.

Banking and Credit

The undermentioned are the leading banks in the Federation. Those marked with an asterisk are banks incorporated here:—

Ban Hin Lee Bank, Ltd.
Bank of China.
*Batu Pahat Bank, Ltd.
Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.
Eastern Bank, Ltd.

Oversea Chinese Banking Corporation, Ltd.

In addition approximately 800 "Remittance Shops" operate under permit in the territory for the purpose of facilitating petty remittances to China, particularly to districts where no banking facilities are available.

There is no central bank in the Federation and therefore there is no official bank rate. The terms on which credit is offered as well as the scale of charges for banking services are fixed by the members of the Malayan Exchange Banks Association.

The following comparative figures of Post Office Savings Bank transactions for the years 1947 and 1948 cover the Federation of Malaya with the exception of the Settlements of Penang and Malacca:

|                | 1947       | 1948       |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| Number of open accounts | $165,212.00 | $182,854.00 |
| Number of transactions | $382,379.00 | $360,878.00 |
| Liability to depositors exclusive of interest | $27,843,627.90 | $35,600,000.00 |
| Turnover        | $40,245,101.67 | $42,300,000.00 |

Foreign Exchange Control was inaugurated in the Federation of Malaya on 4th January, 1946, in conformity with the system already in force throughout the sterling area or "Scheduled Territories" as they are now known.

A feature of Exchange Control in Malaya is the system of allowing remittances by Chinese up to a limit of $45 per month for the maintenance of their families in China. This system is operated through remittance shops who undertake to collect money, write letters from the remitter to beneficiary, and through an agent in China deliver the money, write the acknowledgment at the dictation of the beneficiary, and deliver the reply. This concession represents a considerable export of resources to China, for which, from a Foreign Exchange viewpoint, no consideration is received in return.

A recent revision of the conditions under which remittance shops are permitted to operate has been made, which provides that such shops can operate only under permit issued by the Controller. At the same time, a substantial deposit or a bank's guarantee is required from remittance shops in order to afford protection of the remitters.

Another aspect which is of interest is the trade carried on between Malaya on the one hand and Sumatra, Java and the islands adjacent to Malaya on the other. This trade is known as "Chin Chew" trade and is a very important one in normal times, but during the period under review owing to the difficulties—political and otherwise in Sumatra—it has been restricted. The system operates in the following manner. A Chin Chew trader exports by Tongkang to an adjacent territory a cargo of Malayan goods and brings back a cargo of approximately the equivalent value of local produce. Alternatively, he may take with him a certain amount of Malayan money to non-Malayan territories in which Malayan currency circulates, and there purchase local produce which he brings to this country, sells and buys local produce acceptable in adjacent territories. Malayan currency may not, however, be exported to or imported from those parts of the N.E.I. which come within N.E.I. Customs jurisdiction. In such cases, any balance which cannot be settled by barter, may be transferred through banking channels."
