UGANDA

SITUATION AND AREA

The territories comprising the Uganda Protectorate are surrounded by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Kenya, Tanganyika, Ruanda-Urundi (under Belgian mandate) and the Belgian Congo. The Protectorate extends from about parallel 1° south latitude to the northern limits of the navigable waters of the Albert Nile at Nimule. The eastern boundary runs from Mount Zulia on the Sudan border along the Turkana escarpment, to the summit of Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and thence follows the Malawa and the Sio rivers into the north-eastern waters of Lake Victoria. The outstanding features on the western side are the Nile-Congo watershed, Lake Albert, the River Semliki, the Ruwenzori Range (16,794 feet), and Lake Edward. The area of the Protectorate is approximately 93,981 square miles, of which 13,680 square miles are water and swamp.

CLIMATE

Except for certain highland areas in the southwest and in the east, and for the lower-lying Lake Albert and Nile Valley area, most of Uganda is at an altitude of about 4,000 feet. The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° F. and 75° F., and at Entebbe the mean temperature, the mean maximum and the mean minimum are 71° F., 78° F. and 63° F. respectively.

Over most of Uganda the annual rainfall is between 40 inches and 55 inches but local departures vary from a minimum of approximately 23 inches to a maximum of 90 inches. The rainy season is not very well defined but there are generally two drier seasons in the year—one including June and July and the other December and January.

The climate is on the whole not unhealthy for Europeans, particularly at the higher levels, the pleasantest months being January to March and July to October.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Protectorate forms part of the central African tableland, the elevation varying from about 3,720 feet above sea level at Lake Victoria to about 3,300 to the west of Hoima and Masindi, where there is a sudden fall of 1,200 feet to Lake Albert. To the north of Lake Albert, 2,928 feet, there is a gradual descent along the valley of the Nile, while Kabale in the extreme south-west is at an altitude of 6,400 feet. Central Uganda is a densely populated country of flattened hills and valleys, lakes and swamps. It is fertile and capable of producing a large variety of crops, chiefly cotton, coffee, sugar, tobacco and rubber. The principal native food crops are plantains, millet and sweet potatoes; maize, rice, sugar-cane, chillies, yams, ground-nuts, sim-sim and a little wheat are also grown. Western Uganda is an elevated, mountainous area, part of which is short grass land, with a healthy climate where European fruits and vegetables can be grown. Big game is plentiful and there are areas of dense forest. North-eastern Uganda, towards the borders of the Sudan, is a dry and arid area, sparsely populated by semi-nomadic tribes.

Uganda is essentially an agricultural country. Except for the Karamojong in the north-east and the Bahima in the short grass lands of the southwest, who live chiefly by cattle raising and trading, the population is almost entirely engaged in agriculture. Cotton lint and cotton seed represent over 60 per cent. of the value of the total exports, and cotton is entirely a native grown crop, so that the agricultural production of the Protectorate is very largely in the hands of African cultivators. There are a few non-native estates, those owned by Europeans being engaged in the production of coffee, rubber, and tea, while the sugar and sisal estates are in the hands of Asians. Alienation of land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended.

There is a wide range of minerals such as gold, tin, wolfram, tantalite-columbite, bismuth, mica, copper, beryl, asbestos, lead, graphite, iron and phosphates which hitherto have been worked only on a small scale. Interest has been taken in substances suitable for local industries such as salt, limestone, glass sands, pottery clays, talc, etc.

One hundred and ninety-four cotton ginneries, two sugar factories and a distillery for the manufacture of power alcohol have been established; there are tobacco factories at Kampala and Jinja, and coffee curing factories at Kampala, Masaka and Bubulu. Other industries are as yet in their infancy but the resources of water power in different parts of the Protectorate are considerable and will doubtless play their part in the future economic history of the country.

The headquarters of the Uganda administration are at Entebbe, and the chief commercial towns are Kampala and Jinja; all three are on or near the north shore of Lake Victoria and all are supplied with electricity.

No part of the Protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Kigezi in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile Valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria can be contracted throughout the year.

With reasonable care, European infants appear to thrive well in the greater part of the country, provided they are kept free from such tropical infections as malaria. Ordinarily European children are not retained longer than over 6 or 7 years of age but this is mainly due to difficulties in respect of schooling.

Sleeping sickness, which proved such a scourge to the country in 1902 and the years following and necessitated the evacuation of the natives from the islands in Lake Victoria, and from the shores of the great lakes and rivers, is now well under control. During 1921 and 1922 the island population was to a great extent restored and many of the islands were successfully reopened. A few cases still occur, usually amongst persons living in contact with tsetse fly. A department of Tsetse Control was formed in January, 1947. Its work to date has mainly been to survey the tsetse areas with the object of determining the distribution of the species and, by such methods as controlled late burning of the grass, to stem the advance of the tsetse.

Active measures against all endemic and epidemic diseases are being taken by the medical and administrative authorities, and the country is rapidly becoming healthier, especially in towns and closely developed areas.

The most important native language is Luganda, belonging to the Bantu group, while Swahili, in a debased form, is widely understood. In the north-east, Nilotic languages are used.

Total (1948 Census) .. 4,926,725

The African population is divided into four language groups, the Bantu, Nilotic, Nilo-hamitic and Sudanian. The Bantu speakers fall sociologically into four groups; first, the independent mountaineers living on Mt. Ruwenzori (the Amba and Konjo), Mt. Elgon (the Gishu) and on the high ridges of Kigezi District (the Chiga). The first three communities practise circumcision as part of a system of age-sets, the last do not. The second group of Bantu speakers are the serf population of the plains, known in Ankole as "Iro", in Ruanda-Urundi as "Hutu" and in Karagwe (Tanganyika) as "Nyambo". The third group of Bantu speakers are the aristocracy of Kushitic origin who derive from Western Ethiopia, and who have for the last four centuries dominated Ankole, Ruanda-Urundi and Karagwe. These people, known variously as Hima, Hema or Huma, and Tusi or Tutsi, now speak the Bantu languages of their serfs. The fourth group of Bantu speakers are those who live in the central areas of the Protectorate and are deeply affected both in culture and blood by nilotic influences. This last group includes many of the best known Uganda tribes, i.e. the Ganda, Nyoro, Soga, Toro.

The principal Nilotic tribes belong to the Lwo group, which includes as well as the Acholi, the Alur and the Jo pa Dhola of Uganda, the Shilluk, Anuak and Jur of the Southern Sudan, and the Jo Luo of Kenya. The Lango of Uganda also belong by culture, though not by descent, to this group. It is now known that the present reigning dynasties in Bunyoro, Toro and Buganda derive from men of Lwo stock, and are not (as was first suggested by Speke and accepted by many later authorities) of Hima origin. These mixed Nilotic-Bantu dynasties have been dominant in the central areas of Uganda for some three centuries. Up till the early 18th century the Nyoro dynasty (from which the other dynasties of this group derive) was supreme, but the destruction of the Nyoro army of invasion in Central Ruanda at this period signalled the decay of the Nyoro kingdom and the complementary rise of the Ganda to a position of dominance, which was finally established by their alliance with the British.

The Nilo-hamites are a congeries of tribes of mixed Nilotic and Hamitic origin. Like the Nilotic tribes they spread over Kenya, Uganda and the Southern Sudan. They are thought to derive from central Somaliland, whence they were evicted by the Oromo (Galla) people, the latter themselves under pressure from the Somali. The Uganda tribes of this group are the Iteso, the Kumam, the Ikarimojong, the Labwor, the Dodoth and the Sabei, who are related to the Bari, Lango, Lotuko and Tapotha of the Sudan, and the Turkana, Suk, Nandi, Kipsigis and Masai of Kenya. Lake Kyoga and its eastward extension in the Mpologoma swamp proved an effective barrier to the movement of these tribes, who might otherwise have over-run the Bantu Kingdoms.

The Sudanians are a group of negro tribes extending all the way along the Nile-Congo watershed from the French territory of Ubangi-Shari. These peoples are believed to have been impelled eastwards into Uganda by the victorious campaigns of the Azande and Mangbettu tribes, whose aristocracies derive from Hamitic people of the Chad region. The Sudanian tribes of Uganda are the Madi, the Lugbara and the Kuku. People of this same stock also probably form the majority of the population of the Alur and Kakwa tribes. The Sudanians mostly inhabit West Nile District, the old "Lado Enclave", but some have crossed the Nile and have mingled with the Acholi.

RELIGION

The Protestant and Roman Catholic churches have been working in the Protectorate for over 60 years and now have about one and a quarter million adherents between them. There are also several hundreds of thousands of Muslims. The remainder of the population is pagan at heart, though the desire for education brings many more into the orbit of the missions each year.

The Protestants are represented by the Church Missionary Society, and, to a much smaller degree, by the Seventh Day Adventists and the Salvation Army. The Roman Catholic church is represented by the White Fathers (French), the Verona Mission (Italian) and the Mill Hill Mission Canadian and Dutch.

HISTORY

The countries that now make up the Protectorate did not become known to Europe until the journey of Speke and Grant in search of the sources of the Nile. In 1862, coming from the south, they were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala, and were astonished to find themselves among an organised and comparatively civilised people. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages—the discovery of the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864 and Egyptian plans for the annexation of much of present-day Uganda followed. Under such famous governors as Baker, Gordon and Emin, the Egyptian flag flew in the Nile district from 1872 to 1889.

Stanley visited Uganda in 1875 and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa's dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed in 1879 by French Roman Catholics. Mutesa died in 1884 and was succeeded by his son Mwanga.

Christianity had meanwhile made headway, but Mwanga proved unfavourable to it, and for his father's tolerance substituted persecution and even massacre of the missionaries' adherents. In 1888 his people turned on him and he fled to the south of Lake Victoria; but, the Arab traders and native Mohammedans gaining the upper hand, the missionaries and native christians were also driven out. In the same year control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company, and when the Anglo-German agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda,
Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the company's influence in Uganda. He found Mwanga recently restored with the help of his fugitive Christian subjects, and concluded a treaty with him within a few days of his arrival.

In 1891 Lugard visited the western limits of the British sphere and, at the south end of Lake Albert, found a remnant of Emin's Egyptian (Sudanese) troops. These he enlisted and brought into Buganda. In January, 1892, soon after his return to Kampala, war broke out between the Protestant and Roman Catholic factions. The latter were defeated and fled taking Mwanga with them. Peace was concluded and Mwanga restored in March, 1892.

Meanwhile the company, crippled by the cost of occupation, gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda, and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future governance. On 1st April, 1893, he assumed on behalf of the British Government the obligations and responsibilities of the company in Buganda and the Union Jack replaced the company's flag at the fort, which may still be seen on Old Kampala Hill. The formal establishment of a Protectorate, over Mwanga's kingdom only, was deferred until 18th June, 1894. Meanwhile Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler, Kabarega, driven out by the combined forces of the Sudanese (led by British officers) and the Baganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions, which are now included within the present Uganda, and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory. Henceforward Mwanga's kingdom (which is the present Buganda Province) was referred to as "Buganda". It was extended at this time to include three counties of old Bunyoro, thereby creating a tribal problem which has remained insoluble.

In July, 1897, Mwanga fled from his country for the third and last time, and in the following August his infant son, Daudi Chwa, the father of the present Kabaka (or ruler) of Buganda, was proclaimed in his stead. A few months later the very existence of the protectorate was threatened by a mutiny of the Sudanese troops. They occupied Luba's fort in Busoga and murdered their commander, Captain Thruston. Indian troops were hurried to Uganda but the position was not restored until February, 1898.

Since then there is little but peaceful progress to record. Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government in 1900 as Special Commissioner to settle the country, and concluded an agreement with the Kabaka and people of Buganda, which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown and the ownership of the land. The next year similar agreements were made with the chiefs in Toro and Ankole. Administration has since been extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganised tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" have been followed wherever and whenever it was possible, as in the "agreement districts." In 1903 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony, and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of frontiers with the Sudan, the Belgian Congo and German East Africa, now Tanganyika. In 1903 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign to the Colonial Office.

During the First World War the population of all races contributed their quota to the success of the British cause in the East African campaign. This was repeated in the Second World War in which soldiers from Uganda fought in the Ethiopian, Madagascar and Burma campaigns with distinction, while military labour corps rendered valuable service in the Middle East. The period between the wars was marked by a large increase in agricultural productivity and consequent commercial activity, in which the rapidly growing Indian community played a dominating part. Government was characterised during this period by a system whereby the indigenous structure of "chiefly" appointments in Buganda Province was gradually extended all over the territory and transformed into a local civil service. Towards the end of this period experiments were in progress particularly in the Eastern Province towards the establishment of a more liberal system, whereby the power of the chiefs as tribal judges was limited by a panel of jurors, while their administrative authority was balanced by the advice of a local elected Council. In Buganda, however, where the constitution was defined by the 1900 Agreement, such experiments were more difficult to organise.

Discontent among manual labourers at the rise in cost of living towards the end of the Second World War was sedulously fostered by a group of Buganda agitators who sought to effect a coup d'état. A general strike was organised in Buganda in January, 1945, and blocks placed on roads radiating from Kampala. This attempt to upset the Civil Government of the Protectorate was frustrated and measures taken to deal with the persons responsible and to alleviate the causes of discontent. However, public opinion was further exacerbated in September, 1945, by the assassination of M. Nsibirwa, the Chief Minister (Katikiro) of Buganda on the steps of Namirembe Protestant Cathedral by an employee of the opposition. A secondary effect of these civil disturbances was to accelerate the process of constitutional change which had already been under consideration, so as to devolve greater responsibility on to the local councils and upon their elected members.

In implementation of the policy of devolution of responsibility an adjustment has been made in the division of direct African taxation between the Protectorate Government and African Local Governments by which a smaller proportion of revenue goes to the central Protectorate Government and a correspondingly greater proportion of revenue goes to the African Local Governments whose financial ability to assume a greater share of those responsibilities which properly come within the sphere of local government is thereby increased. The adjustment did not apply to the Buganda Province whose Government was not in favour of the proposal.

Early in 1949, the "African Local Governments Ordinance" was passed in respect of the whole Protectorate excluding Buganda which has, under the Uganda Agreement, somewhat similar powers. This Ordinance provides for the legal recognition and reconstitution of Councils, increases their powers in matters of Local Government and defines more clearly their position in relation to the administration of the Protectorate. "The African Local Governments Ordinance" also gives legal force to bye-laws made by District Councils.

In April, 1949, following the failure of certain demands of a constitutional and economic nature by political agitators, widespread organised
disturbances broke out in the province of Buganda in which much damage to property was caused. The property of loyal Buganda officials and that of the Buganda Government suffered in particular. The disturbances are at present the subject of a Commission of Inquiry whose investigations, at the time of writing, are not yet complete.

CONSTITUTION

By the Uganda Order-in-Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, both consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, and the Resident, Buganda (ex-officio members), and such other persons holding office in the Public Service as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such other persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. There are one official and two unofficial members.

It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor, Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture and Director of Education (ex-officio members), with official and unofficial members as in the case of the Executive Council. There are ten unofficial members (three European, three Indian and four African). There are at present four official members in addition to those noted above.

A system of councils is now established in every Province. These are at five levels which provide a chain of election from the bottom upwards to Legislative Council—the parish, the sub-county, the county, the district and the Province. In the Eastern, Western and Northern Provinces the provincial council acts as an electoral college for entry to the Legislative Council of the Protectorate. In these three Provinces the district council (which is in fact the tribal assembly) is the most important organ of government. In Buganda Province however, where the tribal assembly is at the Provincial level, district councils do not exist, and members are elected direct from the county councils to the "Great Lukiko" (i.e., the Council of Buganda).

At present the Provincial Councils of the Eastern and Northern Provinces elect, subject to the Governor's approval, one member each to Legislative Council. In the case of the Western Province a member is nominated in turn by the Mugabe of Ankole, the Mukama of Toro and the Mukama of Bunyoro. The declared intention of Government is that as Provincial Councils gain experience the Eastern and Northern Provincial Councils shall elect two members; H.H. the Kabaka will continue to nominate one of his Ministers and the Buganda Lukiko shall elect one member; in the case of the Western Province the Provincial Council shall elect one member and the Mugabe of Ankole, the Mukama of Toro and the Mukama of Bunyoro, will continue to nominate one member in turn.

ADMINISTRATION

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces—Buganda, Eastern, Western and Northern. Buganda is on a different footing from the remain-

der, owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 by which its form of government is largely controlled.

The Ruler of Buganda, the Kabaka, is accorded under the Uganda Agreement the title of "Highness" and a salute of 9 guns, a degree of recognition which is not accorded to the rulers of the three Agreement Districts, Ankole (the Omugabe), Toro (the Omukama), and Bunyoro (the Omukama). Although in the Uganda Agreement it is laid down that the Kabaka shall rule the Buganda "to whom he shall administer justice through the Lukiko, or native council, and through others of his officers in the manner approved by Her Majesty's Government", in fact his powers are largely delegated to his Chief Minister (Katikiro), Principal Judge (Omumaluzi) and Chief Accountant (Omwanka). The same tripartite structure of local government headquarters is in course of development on similar lines in other provinces at district level.

All chiefs in Buganda and the three Agreement Districts are appointed by the Ruler "with the approval of the Governor". Elsewhere appointment of chiefs is by the Governor direct, though the recommendation may come from a committee of the District Council. Chiefs are now by legal definition everywhere the executive officers of local government, and they combine in their functions administration, judicial, and fiscal duties. Their administrative powers are defined by the Native Authority Ordinance (Cap. 112 Laws), their judicial powers by the Native Courts Ordinance (No. 3 of 1940) and their fiscal duties by the Native Administration Tax Ordinance.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education was at first entirely and still is mainly in the hands of the various missionary societies, who receive grants from the Protectorate Government. Their efforts have, for some years past, been supplemented by Government.

Expenditure is as follows:

(1) Total Direct Expenditure on African Education Grants to state-aided schools—Government schools and Teacher Training Centre—School Inspectors, etc. £340,000

(2) Total Direct Expenditure on Indian and Goan Education—Grants to Indian Schools, Teacher Training, etc. £45,000

(3) Total Direct Expenditure on European education £6,000

(4) Total Expenditure on Administration, Scholastic materials—Maintenance of School Grounds, Stores and Materials—Contribution to internal and external travelling and transport of staff and students £59,000

Total £450,000

Information Service

Information Services form part of the activities of the Department of Public Relations and Social Welfare, which was set up at the end of 1946 as part of the plan for post-war development of the country.
Since its inception, the department has initiated the following information services:

The Publication of official bulletins in Luganda, Lutoro, Ateso, Lunyankole, Gang, Gujarati and English with a wide circulation.

The independent vernacular press, at present printed only in Luganda, takes a special two-page sheet of news, communiques, etc., prepared by the department, which is included as an insert in every copy of the papers published.

The presentation and the release of departmental news to the European and the vernacular press is undertaken as a routine service, as is the supply of news items to overseas and East African journals.

A press club has been started in Kampala for the use of vernacular editors, where meetings with the Public Relations Office officials are held weekly for informal discussion. An African journalists' society has also been formed.

Six demonstration teams are constantly touring the territory, presenting to the people progressive ideas concerning all aspects of social, economic and cultural life. A mobile cinema van showing news and educational films is attached to each of the units.

A series of lectures to explain government to the people, and Government's plan and projects for the future, has been inaugurated for English-speaking Africans, together with cinema shows to vary the programme.

Medical

Large African, Asian and European hospitals are provided by Government in Kampala, the commercial capital of the protectorate.

Medical officers are stationed in every district headquarters and have charge of a hospital and a chain of dispensaries and aid posts, situated in the more densely populated areas. These subsidiary centres are regularly visited by the medical officers.

Nursing sisters are attached to most of the district hospitals, and, in addition to tutorial and supervisory duties, conduct ante-natal and child welfare clinics at regular intervals in the larger dispensaries.

Hospital accommodation in most districts has been considerably improved in recent years.

There is a full time medical officer of health in Kampala. Responsibility for public health is vested in the medical officer in each district, assisted in some of the more populous areas by a health inspector.

Schools for the training of Africans as Assistant Medical Officers, Dispensers and Nurses are attached in the African Hospital in Kampala. Midwives are trained at Namirembe and Nsambya Missions which are situated near Kampala. At Masaka, in Buganda, there is a training centre for Medical Assistants and Nursing Orderlies and a further centre at Lira, in the Northern Province, for Nursing Orderlies; selected men from this centre are allowed to qualify as medical assistants. African Health Inspectors and Hygiene Orderlies are trained at Mbale in the Eastern Province.

Labour

Although a small Labour Department has been maintained for a number of years, this fell during the war to a smaller Inspectorate, and the organisation of a substantial Department only commenced in 1948.

The present authorised establishment is a Labour Commissioner, two Senior Labour Officers, a Senior Medical Officer (seconded), two Factories Inspectors and ten Labour Officers (or Assistant Labour Officers).

In addition the senior African staff consists of a Senior Labour Inspector and twelve Labour Inspectors.

Its duties are those usually undertaken by a colonial labour department in accordance with the International Labour Conventions and consist mainly of the implementation of local labour legislation including that applicable to women and children, supervision, inspection, conciliation and advice in labour disputes, assessment of workmen's compensation and the organisation of labour exchanges. In addition there is a particular responsibility for the organisation and welfare of the large numbers of workers who come into Uganda annually from the Belgian territories.

Welfare

Social Welfare or Community Centres are being established by capital grants where need is proved and local initiative shown. Clubs for African women have been formed in Buganda and Busoga on lines similar to Women's Institutes in England. Close liaison is maintained with the Missions, Medical Department, voluntary and youth associations: grants in aid are made in some cases. A mass literacy campaign has been launched in Buganda and experiments are being made in other provinces. Follow-up literature is provided through the Uganda African Literature Committee, which is financed through the Department of Public Relations and Social Welfare and the East African Literature Bureau. Continuation or adult classes have been started in the Kampala area. A probation service is now being established.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

The system of all-weather main roads radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres is maintained by the Public Works Department, which has a road mileage of 2,465 under its control. In the Western Province the system establishes connection between the tin mines and the Kagera River Steamship Service, taps the resources of the Rutshuru area of the Belgian Congo for that service and links up direct the district headquarters in the West of the Protectorate. Connections with adjoining territories are made in the East with Kenya, in the North with the Sudan, in the West with the Belgian Congo, in the South with Tanganyika and in the South-West with Ruanda-Urundi. About 8,621 miles of excellent roads are also kept up by the native administrations. Motor transport, in consequence of these facilities, has reached an advanced stage of development in the Protectorate.

Railways, Air Services and Postal Services

PUBLIC FINANCE

The revenue is principally derived from income tax, poll taxes, customs and excise duties, cotton and coffee taxes, trading licences and land rents. The revenue from income tax in 1945 was £291,373, from poll taxes £633,861, and from customs and excise duties £1,045,690. There has been no grant-in-aid from the British Government since 1914-15. The Uganda Loan, 1932 (£2,235,600), was floated in January, 1932, and
Uganda Loan, 1937 (£614,400), was floated in April, 1939. The unit of currency is the East African shilling.

The currency is the same as that of Kenya. Banking facilities are afforded by the National Bank of India, Ltd., with branches at Entebbe, Mbale, Kampala, and Jinja, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., with branches at Kampala, Jinja and Mbale and Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Kampala, Jinja and Mbale.

Western Pacific

High Commission
The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by the Western Pacific Order-in-Council of 1877.
The High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised power. By the Pacific Order in Council of 1893 the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order-in-Council, 1922, the High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends also to the New Hebrides, and the Banks and Torres Islands.
The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of the expenses of the British Agent and Consul in Tonga and the British Services in the New Hebrides.
The Chief Justice of Fiji and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a judicial commissioner.
Deputy commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.
The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.
A Judicial Commissioner's Court has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.
With some few exceptions an appeal against all decisions of the High Commissioner's court lies to the Supreme Court of Fiji.
In addition to other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons who endanger the peace of the islands.
The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:
The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (including the Phoenix and Line Islands groups).
The British Solomon Islands protectorate.
Tonga.
The New Hebrides.
Pitcairn Island.
Particulars of these are given below.
