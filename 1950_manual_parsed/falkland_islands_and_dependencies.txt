Falkland Islands

Situation and Area
The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles south of Monte Video. They consist of East Falkland Island and West Falkland Island, which, with the adjacent islands, have an estimated area of 2,580 square miles and 2,038 square miles respectively.

There are two groups of Dependencies: (i) South Georgia with South Orkney and South Sandwich, the boundaries being the 50th parallel of south latitude and the 20th and 50th meridians of west longitude; (ii) South Shetland and Graham Land, bounded by the parallel of latitude 58° S., and the meridians of longitude 50° and 80° W.

The island of South Georgia lies about 800 miles to the east of the Falkland Islands, South Orkney and South Sandwich being about 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia. The northern point of South Shetland is about 500 miles south of the Falklands.

Climate
In the Falklands the temperature is uniformly low, ranging from 70° to 28°F in summer and from 58° to 20°F in winter, with an annual mean of 43°F.

Data based on records from 1929–1947, excluding 1930:

Lowest annual rainfall, 18 inches in 1946.
Greatest annual rainfall, 35 inches in 1945.

The annual rainfall seldom exceeds 30 inches, and although snow falls frequently it does not as a rule lie long. In summer the atmosphere is at times very dry and evaporation rapid.

The climate is healthy, though somewhat trying to people from the United Kingdom owing to the constant high winds in summer. The conditions of living generally are of a reasonably good standard though limited resources and horizons render the country unsuitable for persons of a neurasthenic tendency. An adequate variety of diet is obtainable and the quality of the food is very fair. Good vegetables can be grown and fruit is procured from Monte Video.

General Description
The Falkland Islands have a very deeply indented coast line and many good natural harbours. The surface is hilly, attaining its maximum elevation of 2,315 feet in Mount Adam, West Falkland.

The entire country is covered with wild moorland interrupted by outcrops of rock and the peculiar collections of angular boulders named "stone runs."

There is no cultivation, except in the immediate vicinity of the settlements and shepherds' houses where vegetables and in a few places hay is grown. The soil is chiefly peat but areas of sand also occur. There are no indigenous trees.

The only town is Stanley in East Falkland, with a population of about 1,250. The houses are mostly iron and wood, built as required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house but there are several boarding houses affording fair accommodation. Stanley is a port of register and had, on 31st December, 1948, 11 vessels, aggregating 2,972 tons.
The cost of mutton is 3d. per lb., of beef 4d., fowls' eggs, when procurable, cost 2½d. to 3d. each, and penguin eggs in spring are sold at a price varying from 4s. to 8s. 6d. per hundred. Milk is 8d. per quart. Most other foodstuffs have to be imported.

**DEPENDENCIES**

The Dependencies—South Georgia, the South Shetlands, the Sandwich Islands and all islands and territories between the 20th degree of west longitude and the 50th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude, with all islands and territories between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude, which are situated south of the 58th parallel of south latitude—are defined in the Letters Patent of the 21st July, 1908, as amended by the Letters Patent of the 28th March, 1917.

The island of South Georgia is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, and the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea. There is a coastal fringe free from snow in summer and more or less clothed with vegetation, including tussock grass, on the N.E. side of the island. Land whaling stations are established in four of the numerous bays.

The remaining Dependencies are even more inhospitable, being nearly completely covered with snow and ice and almost entirely destitute of plant life. All the Dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character. A chain of stations at which work on surveying, geology, meteorology, etc., is done is maintained in them.

This work is carried out by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, the personnel of which are recruited from the United Kingdom and the Dominions.

**POPULATION IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS**

The population is white and almost exclusively of British descent or birth.

Population, 31st December, 1948—males 1,239; females, 1029. Total 2,268.

Birth rate, 1948—13·66 per 1,000.

Death rate, 1948—11·02 per 1,000.

**RELIGION**

The population is predominantly Protestant, but there is a strong Roman Catholic section. In Stanley there are the Church of England Cathedral, a Non-conformist Tabernacle and a Roman Catholic Chapel.

**HISTORY**

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1764 Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis in East Falkland. The French settlement was taken over by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1766.

In 1765 Captain Byron took possession of West Falkland, and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770; this action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the British garrison in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774. In 1820, the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement in the East Falkland which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government. Until 1843, they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making Admiralty surveys. In 1843, a Civil Administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis until the following year when they were removed to Stanley, then known as Port William.

The colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 until 1880 and for a mail service until 1884-5, since which year the colony has been self-supporting.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain James Cook, who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain William Smith in 1819, and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821.

The Dependencies were visited only by exploring expeditions, sealers and whalers until the rise of the modern whaling industry in those regions.

**The Falkland Islands Company, Limited**

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian and other settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This, however, was not found profitable, and the company have for many years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, in shipping, and in general trade.

**CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION**

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council composed of three *ex officio* members and three nominated members, and a Legislative Council composed of three *ex officio* members, four elected members, two nominated unofficial, and three nominated official. The nominated members of the Legislative Council are appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet. Unless dissolved earlier by the Governor, elections are held every four years.

There is a Town Council for Stanley.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

In Stanley, a Government school is maintained from public funds, which, whilst being elementary in character, makes provision for attendance at a continuation class for a two years' course of further education.

The Government contributes £2 per month towards the cost of the board and lodging of children from the country districts attending school in Stanley.

One supervisor of camp education and fourteen camp teachers are provided by the Government. Some of these teachers travel from house to house but eight settlements have resident teachers. The number of children receiving education in the colony in 1948 was 332.

Two scholarships, for a period of three years, are awarded annually to successful candidates between the ages of 13 and 14 years at the British school in Monte Video. The first scholarships commenced in February, 1943.

(Note.—"Camp" is the term applied locally to the country districts outside Stanley.)

**Health**

For medical purposes the Colony is divided into four areas each of which is supervised by a medical officer. The hospital is in Stanley in charge of the Senior Medical Officer. It is
small and out of date but extensions are being built. A motor fishing vessel specially equipped for the purpose is used to carry urgent cases from outlying places to hospital and an ambulance plane service has been inaugurated.

The general health of the Colony is good but epidemics of measles, rubella, mumps and streptococcal throat occur periodically to which the people have little natural resistance.

Ante-natal and child-welfare clinics held weekly in the hospital are well attended. Routine examination of the school children is made twice a year.

Maternity cases are encouraged to come into hospital as many of the outlying farms are very far from medical help.

The chief causes of minor ill-health is the common cold and a mild, endemic gastro-enteritis which reaches epidemic form in late spring and early autumn.

A dental officer is attached to the medical department.

Labour

There is a general workers' union entitled the Labour Federation which includes practically the whole labour force of the Colony.

Welfare

Although there is no special Welfare Department its purposes are served by the Medical Department and the Labour Federation.

Communication

Internal communication is maintained by sea and horses, but there are no roads beyond the immediate vicinity of Stanley, the traveller being guided by natural landmarks.

Communication between Stanley and the outside world is effected principally through Monte Video, to which port a service is maintained by the s.s. Fitzroy, belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited, and running on a mail contract renewed annually from 1941.

The distance from Stanley to Monte Video is rather more than 1,000 miles and the time taken on the voyage by the s.s. Fitzroy is about five days. Opportunities for the receipt and despatch of mails are available every few weeks.

The inter-isular service for mails and passengers is maintained by s.s. Fitzroy.

When ice conditions allow communication with the ports in the Dependencies is kept up by the m/v John Biscoe.

There are two wireless stations for external traffic, one at Stanley and one at Cumberland Bay, in South Georgia. A smaller station at Fox Bay on the West Falkland is maintained for inter-isular communication. The principal farm stations on East Falkland Island are connected by telephone with the Stanley exchange and those on West Falkland Island with the Government headquarters at Fox Bay.

The usual postal services are available and include use of air letter forms for correspondence within the Commonwealth.

All mail travels by sea as far as Monte Video—about 5 days voyage.

The radio-telegraphic station communicates with England, Norway, Uruguay, Argentine, Chile, the Antarctic Bases and South Georgia. The tariff includes the usual reduced variants for greetings, etc.

Assets, December, 1948—Colony, £264,805; Dependencies (including Research Fund), Not available. There is no Public Debt.
Currency and Banking

The currency is British coinage and local £5, £1 and 10s. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established, in which, on 31st December, 1948, the deposits were £502,496, belonging to 1,826 depositors.

Production and Trade

The inhabitants of the Falkland Islands are occupied in sheep farming, the whole acreage of the Colony being divided into large sheep runs. Wool is the principal product but tallow and hides are also exported. There were on 30th June, 1948, 618,627 sheep, 10,725 cattle and 2,810 horses in the islands.

The whaling field of the Dependencies, in which whaling by modern methods was first carried on in 1904, became more productive than all those in the rest of the world combined, but declined greatly with the development of pelagic whaling. Seal oil is also produced.

In the case of the Colony, exports in 1948 amounted to £321,384; 96·6 per cent. went to United Kingdom; and 74·19 per cent. of the imports came from the British Empire.

Dependencies—14·06 per cent. of imports from British Empire, mainly United Kingdom. Exports £3,900,203; of this total £2,140,928 or 54·88 per cent. consigned to United Kingdom.
