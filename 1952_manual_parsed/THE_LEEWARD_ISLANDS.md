EDUCATION

During the year 1950 the cost of education in the Colony was $565,359.

CIVIL SERVICE

A cost-of-living allowance is now paid on salaries as follows:

- 50 per cent. on the first £100.
- 30 per cent. on the second £100.
- 20 per cent. on the third £100.

COMMUNICATIONS

Shipping

Communications between the Colony and the United Kingdom are maintained by vessels of the Harrison Line which call approximately once a month at Antigua and St. Kitts to discharge cargo and load sugar and cotton for the United Kingdom. During the crop season for sugar more frequent calls are made. These vessels call about four times during the last five months of each year at Montserrat in order to load cotton for the United Kingdom. In 1950, a vessel belonging to the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique also maintained a regular service between Antigua and the United Kingdom.

Irregular inter-island services are provided by schooners, sloops and two converted M.L.Cs.

Air

British West Indian Airways maintain a thrice-weekly service between Antigua and St. Kitts, and regular services from Antigua to other parts of the British West Indies. The service to Jamaica connects with the British Overseas Airways Corporation’s service to the United Kingdom.

Pan-American World Airways maintain a service between Puerto Rico and Trinidad, which calls thrice weekly northbound and southbound at Antigua and at St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands whence Tortola in the British Virgin Islands may easily be reached by motor launch.

K.L.M. maintain a service between Curacao and St. Martin, which calls at Guadeloupe and St. Kitts en route.
