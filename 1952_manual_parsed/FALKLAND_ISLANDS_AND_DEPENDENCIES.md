FALKLAND ISLANDS AND DEPENDENCIES

See pages 122–126 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

CLIMATE

The islands are in the same latitude South as London is North but there is little similarity in climate apart from hours of sunshine, which are almost identical. Mean monthly temperatures are uniformly lower but London has both higher and lower extremes. Warm spells, such as occur in a good English summer, are never experienced. Cold outbreaks may occur at almost any time of the year and the weather is generally changeable. The islands are exposed and persistent strong winds spoil many otherwise pleasant days in the summer. (The wind reaches gale force one day in five.) Annual rainfall is rather higher than in the London area.

The climate is bracing. Some people find the strong winds trying though somewhat similar conditions are found in the exposed coastal districts of Scotland. Spring, autumn and winter clothing, as used in the United Kingdom, is suitable. There is no need for extra-heavy under-clothes and wind-proof outer clothing is much warmer.

Mean annual temperature . . . 43° F.
Mean annual maximum . . . 70° F.
Mean annual minimum . . . 19° F.
Mean annual wind speed . . . 15 knots
Mean annual rainfall . . . 30 inches

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Stanley had, on the 31st December, 1950, six vessels on its register aggregating 1,003 registered tons.

POPULATION IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS

Birth rate, 1950—15·68 per 1,000.
Death rate, 1950 : 11·65 per 1,000.

CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council composed of three ex officio members and two nominated members, and a Legislative Council composed of three ex officio members, four elected members, two nominated unofficial, and two nominated official members. The nominated members of the Legislative Council are appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet. Unless the Council is dissolved earlier by the Governor, elections are held every four years.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

In Stanley a Government School is maintained from public funds. It provides infant, primary and secondary courses. The school-leaving age is 14, but provision is made for voluntary attendance at a continuation class for a two years' course of further education. This, in many subjects, reaches school certificate standard.

The Government contributes £2 per month towards the cost of board and lodging of children from the country districts attending the Stanley or Settlement Schools.

One Supervisor of Camp Education and ten Camp teachers are provided by the Government. Some of the teachers travel from house to house but seven settlements have resident teachers. The number of children receiving education in 1950 was 353.

Two scholarships, for a period of three years, are awarded annually to successful candidates between the ages of 12 and 14 years at schools in England. The first scholarships commenced in February, 1943.

(Note: "Camp" is the term applied locally to the country districts outside Stanley.)

Health

The Medical Service of the Colony is at present carried out by three Government Medical Officers, two in Stanley and one at Fox Bay on the West Falkland. In addition to this the Falkland Islands Company employs a doctor at Darwin on the East Falkland.

The Hospital in Stanley is in charge of the Senior Medical Officer. It has, at present, 17 beds, but is in process of extension. When the work is completed in a few months' time it will accommodate 35 patients.

Ante-natal and Child Welfare Clinics are well attended. The Hospital maintains a Maternity Department in which nearly all the confinements from both islands take place. Examinations of the school children take place twice a year and are combined with regular tuberculin tests.

A Dental Officer is stationed at Stanley and a Dentist for the outlying farms on East and West Falklands will, it is hoped, commence duty early in 1952.

The population, entirely European, is, generally speaking, of good health, but has, as frequently observed in other isolated communities, little resistance to infectious diseases imported from the South American coast, which is only five days journey by sea. Fortunately, no severe epidemic diseases of the notifiable group have occurred during the last five years.

The efficiency of the Medical Service, previously entirely dependent on communication by horse or boat, has greatly improved since the introduction of an Air Service, which has proved invaluable in cases of emergency.

Welfare

Although there is no special Welfare Department its purposes are served by the Medical Department, Stanley Town Council, and the Labour Federation. There is an old established Benefit Club in Stanley which provides a form of insurance against unemployment through sickness of its members and assists with funeral expenses. A scheme of Children's Allowances has been introduced by the Government.
