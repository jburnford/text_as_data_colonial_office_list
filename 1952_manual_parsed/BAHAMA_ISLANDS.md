HISTORY

Delete the first two sentences under this heading on page 68 of The Colonial Office List 1951 and insert:

"San Salvador (Watling's Island), so-called by Columbus when he made his landfall there in October, 1492, was known as Guanahani by the aboriginal Lucayan Indians and is one of the most easterly of the Bahamas. A few years after Columbus discovered the islands, the Lucayans were transported to work the mines in Hispaniola."

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

To the list of institutions which provide higher education, "St. John's College" should be added.

Broadcast Lessons. The teacher-training lectures and adult education programmes are now broadcast in the afternoons from 3.15 p.m. to 3.45 p.m. instead of in the evenings.

Information

The North American Regional Broadcasting Conference was duly held in Canada in 1949 and continued in the United States of America in 1950. It was agreed at this Conference that the Bahamas should retain its Class 1-A clear channel on the frequency of 1,540 kcs.

In August, 1950, the Bahamas station ZNS started commercial operation and increased its hours to 15 per day.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

New Providence is served by an adequate road system maintained by the Public Works Department. All the main roads have been surfaced with asphalt, many of them being reconditioned by the R.A.F. during the War. In the Out Islands, Eleuthera has now a good main arterial road, asphalt-surfaced over most of its length, but in the other islands the roads are mainly rough farm tracks, except in the principal towns and settlements, where they are asphalt or concrete-surfaced. Maintenance in the Out Islands is carried out by the local Board of Works.

Shipping

Ships of the Canadian National Steamship Line now provide a regular freight service from Halifax or Montreal.

Freight service between the United Kingdom and the Colony is maintained by steamers of the Royal Mail Line and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company. The latter Line also provides a passenger service by the "Reina del Pacifico". There is also a regular freight service between Nassau and New York and Florida. During the winter months, a number of cruise ships call at Nassau.

Air

Oakes' Airport, the main airport in the Bahamas, provides 24-hour service for long and short range international and local airlines. During 1950 a considerable increase in air traffic over previous years was evident and frequent services were operated between Nassau and England, Canada, the United States, British colonies in the Caribbean and South America.

British Overseas Airways provide services between England and Nassau via Bermuda, and between Nassau and South America via Jamaica. Both British Overseas Airways and Pan-American Airways provide daily services between Nassau and Miami with an increase in frequency of services during the winter season.

Trans-Canada Airlines operate frequent services between Nassau and Toronto, Montreal and Tampa. The Nassau-Montreal service connects with the trans-Atlantic routes of this company to Scotland, London and the continent of Europe. These services are also increased during the season.

The major local company, Bahamas Airways, provides frequent services to West Palm Beach via West End, Grand Bahama, and also conducts twice-weekly services to the main Out Islands. Aircraft of this company and another local company, Skyways Limited, are available for charter flights to any of the Out Islands.

Besides Oakes' Airport, there is another airport at West End, Grand Bahama, which operates from dawn to dusk only, and a private landing strip at Rock Sound, Eleuthera.

At the end of 1950, there were thirteen aircraft on the Bahamas Register of Aircraft. During the year, Oakes' Airport experienced an increase in traffic of approximately 28 per cent. over the 1949 movements. Traffic in the Nassau Control Area was also greatly increased due to the opening of Grand Bahama Airport.

Postal

Internal Services. The daily airmail service to West End, Grand Bahama, has been replaced by a service operating two to three times per week.

International Services. The despatch of airmails direct to Great Britain and Bermuda now takes place three to four times per week (as compared with five times per week previously).
