PRODUCTION AND TRADE

(See Note on page 27)

The quantity and value of the principal products exported during 1950 were:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Asphalt and products | 85,737 tons | $4,308,709 |
| Petroleum products | 1,006,475,442 gals. | 126,304,001 |
| Sugar | 123,553 tons | 17,900,584 |
| Rum | 1,165,600 p.gals. | 2,065,021 |

| Grapefruit juice | 1,007,244 L.gals. | 1,282,472 |
| Bitters | 47,587 p.gals. | 619,962 |

Asphalt. The quantity of asphalt produced in 1950 was 132,846 tons, compared with 145,160 tons in 1949.

Petroleum. Production of crude oil in 1950 amounted to 20,632,421 barrels, compared with 20,616,721 barrels in 1949.

Sugar. The 1950 sugar crop yielded 146,508 tons, compared with 158,890 tons in 1949. Peasant farmers produced 36·81 per cent of a total of 1,401,931 tons of cane milled. At the end of the year there were six sugar factories.

The export of molasses in 1950 was 409,358 cwt. The greater part of the remainder of the supply was used in the manufacture of rum.

Coconuts. Copra milled in 1950 was 35,408,000 lb. compared with 35,353,920 lb. in 1949. With the exception of 1,568,000 lb., which was exported, all the copra produced in 1950 was delivered to the factories for oil extraction and processing.

Citrus. There are now about 14,500 acres under citrus. Good crops of oranges and grapefruit were obtained but the lime crop was indifferent. Exports of all citrus and citrus products during 1950 were valued at $2,176,231 as compared with $1,163,969 in 1949.

Coffee. The acreage of this crop has increased owing largely to replacements under the Cocoa Subsidy Scheme. Heavy rains had a depressing effect on yields, particularly that of the Arabica crop. Returns from the Robusta crop were more satisfactory, but less than those obtained in 1949. In 1950 a total of 1,636,199 lb. of raw coffee and 57,101 lb. of prepared coffee was exported, compared with 2,344,817 lb. of raw coffee and 52,369 lb. of prepared coffee in 1949.

Exports were shipped chiefly to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 31·3%; Brazil, 15·1%; Canada, 14·4%; U.S.A. 8·2%; and Netherlands West Indies, 5%.

The total value of the Colony's imports in 1950 was $169,225,970. Domestic exports totalled $142,283,745; ships' stores and bunkers, $25,278,752; and re-exports 10,029,734, making a total export figure of $177,592,231.
