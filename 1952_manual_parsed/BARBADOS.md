GENERAL DESCRIPTION

In 1951 adult suffrage was introduced and the number of electors is expected to exceed 95,000.

The Public Debt at the 31st March, 1951, remained at £605,360. The Sinking Fund at that date was £276,601.

In 1949–50 grants and loans to the Colony under the United Kingdom Colonial Development and Welfare Acts amounted to £337,500. The figures for 1950–51 were £3,203.

Customs revenue for the financial year 1950–51 amounted to $4,664,404, an increase of $722,781 over the revenue for the previous year.

Duty collected on rum during the financial year was $934,742.

The amount of income tax collected during the financial year was $3,675,740, an increase of $818,739 on the amount collected in the previous year. The rates of income tax vary from year to year.

The main items of expenditure during the financial year 1950–51 were:

- Education, $1,651,566, an increase of $111,044;
- Medical Services, $1,036,729, an increase of $86,810;

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The currency system comprises notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board, set up in 1951, notes previously issued by the Government and by the Governments of British Guiana and Trinidad, and United Kingdom coin of which silver is legal tender up to $9·60 (£2). There is no local issue of coin. Government currency notes continue as legal tender but are being withdrawn with the introduction of the Eastern Caribbean note issue. With this issue the currency note system of the Eastern Group of British Caribbean Territories (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and the Windward Islands) was unified in 1951. Legislative provision was also made for eventual unification of coin.

The number of depositors of the Government Savings Bank at the 30th June, 1950, was 40,876, and the total amount standing to their credit was $10,471,968.

PRODUCTION AND TRADE

(See Note on page 27.)

The trade figures for goods imported during 1950, which amounted to £8,065,944, showed an increase as compared with £7,064,988 for 1949. This increase was due chiefly to the importations of greater quantities of goods and the increased values. The chief imports were animal feeding-stuffs, fish (all kinds), flour, meat (all kinds), rice, lumber, bags and sacks (empty), cotton piece...
goods, other cotton manufactures, artificial silk piece goods, electrical apparatus and machinery.

The total value of exports was £5,736,623, as compared with £4,627,490 in 1949, the increase being largely due to the abundant sugar crop. The main exports and chief industries of the Island centre around the sugar, molasses and rum industries.

The main exports compared with 1949 are set out in the following table.

| Item          | Quantity |
|---------------|----------|
| Sugar, tons   | 126,609  |
| Molasses, gallons | 6,143,926 |
| Rum, gallons  | 631,926  |
| Soap, lbs.    | 238,511  |
| Margarine, lbs.| 326,868  |

| Soap          | 7,702    |

The United Kingdom and Canada are the main customers for sugar, rum and molasses, while the other West Indian Colonies import soap and margarine.
