Health

The largest hospital group is at Dar-es-Salaam with accommodation for a total of 487 of all races.

Government leprosaria are maintained at Chazi in the Eastern Province and Makete in the Southern Highlands. In addition a number of Government subsidised leprosaria are maintained by the Missions in various parts of the Territory.

Specialist services include medicine, surgery, pathology, tuberculosis, ophthalmology and sleeping sickness.

The headquarters of the inter-territorial anti-malarial unit is now at Amani in the Northern Province.

A Departmental Nutrition Officer is at present working with the East African Medical Survey at Mwanza.

Labour

Three Regional Assistant Labour Commissioners and a Trade Testing Inspector have been added to the Labour Department Staff.

On the lines of communication, Government have established various camps and shelters for the free use of African labourers travelling to and from the employment areas which are maintained by this Department; so also have the professional and private recruiters, the latter including organisations of employers. At these camps food is provided and a dresser and first-aid facilities are also available.

Twenty Labour Exchanges are now in operation in the Territory with the object of placing skilled and semi-skilled workers in touch with potential employers. These exchanges are linked together at the headquarters where a further subsidiary exchange deals with applications for employment from districts where no labour exchange exists. Labour exchanges are established at the following more important employment areas and district headquarters:

Arusha; Bukoba; Dar-es-Salaam; Dodoma; Iringa; Kilosa; Korogwe; Lindi; Mbeya; Morogoro; Moshi; Musoma; Mwanza; Njombe; Same; Shinyanga; Songea; Tabora; Tanga; Tukuyu.
