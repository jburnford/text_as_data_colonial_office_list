**SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE**

See pages 371–374 of *The Colonial Office List 1951.*

**Population**

No complete census has been taken but the population of the Protectorate is now estimated at from 500,000 to 700,000.

**Administration**

The Protectorate Advisory Council continues to be an important instrument in the Government of the country. Good progress has been made in the setting up of Local Authorities and District Councils.

**Social Services**

**Health**

It is intended to give short training in simple first-aid and home-nursing to persons nominated by the tribes. These tribal dressers will be supplied with limited quantities of drugs and dressings but will not be paid members of the Medical Department.

**Communications**

A radio telephone now operates between Hargeisa and the district headquarters.

**Public Revenue and Expenditure**

(See Note on page 27.)

The Revenue of the Protectorate for the financial year 1950–51 amounted to £494,096 and the Expenditure to £1,093,797.

**Currency and Banking**

Indian currency was legal tender for many years. East African currency was introduced shortly after the return of British forces to the Protectorate in 1941 and became legal tender concurrently with Indian currency early in 1942. The post-war years saw a gradual extension in the use of East African currency due to government policy of withdrawing rupees from circulation. Finally a general withdrawal and exchange was organized in October, 1951 (to coincide with similar operations in Aden), and Indian currency ceased to be legal tender on 31st October, 1951.

By the time these notes are published a branch bank will have been opened in the capital, Hargeisa, and the normal banking business of the Protectorate (including the Government account), hitherto conducted in Aden, will doubtless have been transferred to it.

There is also a Government Savings Bank in the Protectorate.

**Trade**

(See Note on page 27.)

Imports in 1950 were valued at £1,217,448 and Exports at £726,040. The main imports were rice, dates and other fruit, tea, sugar, yarn and textile fabrics and petrol. The main exports were sheep and sheep and goat skins.
