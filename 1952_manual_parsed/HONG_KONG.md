HONG KONG

See pages 174–187 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

Situation and Area

The Colony of Hong Kong, consisting of a number of islands and a portion of the mainland on the south-eastern coast of China, is situated at the eastern side of the Pearl River between 22° 9' and 22° 37' N. and 113° 52' and 114° 30' E. The capital city, Victoria, situated on the island of Hong Kong, is 91 miles S.E. of Canton and 40 miles E. of the Portuguese Colony of Macao. The island of Hong Kong is about 11 miles long and from 2 to 5 miles broad (total area 32 sq. miles). Opposite and to the north of the island is the peninsula of Kowloon (3½ sq. miles) and Stonecutters Island (¼ sq. mile) which, with Green Island and Aplichau, form the Colonial territory formally ceded by China. The other component of the Colony is the New Territories which includes a large number of islands and a portion of the mainland stretching north of Kowloon for approximately 16 miles, the boundary following the small Shumchun river. This territory is leased from China, its area being 359 sq. miles, making the total area of the Colony 391 sq. miles.

General Description

Hong Kong Island lies close to the mainland, being separated at one point by a narrow strait (Leymun) not more than ¼-mile wide, forming the harbour's main deep-water approach used by ocean-going ships. The harbour (17 sq. miles water area) lies between the island and the mainland. It has one of the finest natural harbours in the world and has up-to-date dock facilities for the largest ships. The surrounding land consists of steep granite hills, which though in many parts treeless, form a panorama of outstanding beauty. The city of Victoria lies along the north side of Hong Kong Island facing the harbour and is largely built on a long strip of reclaimed land. In some places it has been possible to build houses in terraces rising several hundred feet up the hillside and thanks to excellent roads and a vehicular railway there is a considerable residential area on and around the island's heights. The highest point on the island is Victoria Peak (1,809 ft.).

Kowloon, with a population equalling that of Victoria, lies on the mainland opposite Hong Kong on a narrow peninsula jutting southward into the harbour. It formerly was covered by low hills which have been extensively levelled and built on. It also contains the Colony's main industrial area, the main wharves for ocean-going ships, one of the two large dockyards with ship-building facilities, and the southern terminus of the Kowloon-Canton Railway which occupies the extreme southern tip of the peninsula. On the reclaimed area north-east of Kowloon lies the Colony's aerodrome, Kai Tak, with a seaplane base in front of it in Kowloon Bay. North of Kowloon lies the steep escarpment of the Kowloon hills under which the railway passes in a tunnel 2,404 yds. long. The most northerly part of Kowloon immediately south of the Kowloon hills forms one of the Colony's most attractive suburbs known as Kowloon Tong.

North of Kowloon and geographically separated from it by the escarpment, lies the main part of the New Territories by far the largest part of which consist of steep and barren hillsides. Approximately in the centre of the area rises the Colony's highest mountain, Taimoshan (3,141 ft.). The eastern side of the New Territories is more mountainous than the west and has a deeply indented coastline along which are a few villages where a frugal living can be made by farming in narrow valleys and fishing in innumerable inlets. In the north-western part of the New Territories lies the main area of cultivable land in which lies the large market town of Yuen Long. This area, producing chiefly rice, stretches away on the north to the marshes on the eastern shore of Deep Bay. Also included in the New Territories are 75 islands, some of them uninhabitated and others with no more than a single village consisting of one or two families. The largest is Lantao Island at the mouth of the Pearl River estuary, a rugged and beautiful place with twin peaks over 3,000 feet high. Round its coasts are several fishing villages and sheltered among its hills are a number of Buddhist monasteries and settlements. The most populous island is Cheung Chau, a local fishing centre with a land population of approximately 19,000.

Population

No official census has been taken since 1931 when the total population was found to be 849,751. From 1937, when the Japanese invaded China, the Colony's population has fluctuated with the different changes in its own and China's fortunes. In 1941, due to the number of refugees from China, the population was estimated to have risen to over 1,600,000 but during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong it fell rapidly until in August 1945 it was estimated to have been less than 600,000. After the war there was a steady influx of people, most of them Hong Kong residents returning from China, and to these were added from 1949 onwards a great number of refugees, largely from Shanghai, seeking to avoid the troubled conditions attendant upon the change of government in China. By May 1950 the population was estimated to have been the highest in the Colony's history—2,360,000—but in the second part of the year a decline began, many...
of the refugees either proceeding overseas or returning to their homes in China. At the beginning of 1951 the population estimate was 2,030,000, and by the middle of the year it was evident that the figure was steadying at slightly below this last estimate.

**ADMINISTRATION**

Radio Hong Kong is now controlled by the Public Relations Office instead of by the Post Office as in the past.

The departments dealing with agriculture, fisheries, forestry and public gardens were combined in 1950 under a Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. A Director of Marketing was appointed to control the government wholesale fish and vegetable markets; this officer is also Registrar of Co-operative Societies.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

In June 1951 there were 967 registered schools with a total enrolment of approximately 173,000 that is, 43,000 more than in June, 1949.

Primary education extends over a six years' course at the end of which selected pupils may enter either a five years' secondary course in English, leading to the Hong Kong School Certificate, or a six years' secondary course in Chinese which will in the near future lead to a Chinese School Certificate. Alternatively, at the end of the primary stage, pupils may enter the Government Junior Technical School or various private vocational schools. Certain schools have special post-school certificate classes giving a one years' course in preparation either for the Hong Kong University Matriculation or for business.

In the fifth paragraph under this sub-heading on p. 177 of *The Colonial Office List 1951* reference is made to "election" to training colleges. The word "election" should be replaced by "entry".

A School for Higher Chinese Studies was opened in 1951 offering 3-year post-secondary school courses in Chinese, commerce and journalism.

The buildings of the University of Hong Kong were severely damaged and most of the equipment lost during the Pacific War. The University re-opened in 1946 since when the number of students has steadily increased. There are now over 700 students in the faculties of medicine, arts, science, engineering and architecture.

**Health**

The Hong Kong Anti-Tuberculosis Association's Ruttonjee Sanatorium now has approximately 130 beds.

On 30th June, 1951, the staff of the Medical Department of the Colony consisted of:

- Doctors, 156, of whom 132 were Chinese.
- Nurses and Hospital Dressers, 579, of whom 478 were Chinese.
- Health and Malaria Inspectors, 22, of whom 19 were Chinese.
- Others (including technicians, subordinate and menial staff), 1,975, mostly Chinese.

**Labour**

The Commissioner of Labour, who is the adviser to Government on all labour matters, is assisted by a Labour Advisory Board on which employers and workers are represented in equal numbers.

The Illegal Strikes and Lock-outs Ordinance, 1949 (No. 16 of 1949) has been extended to the end of 1951.

**Social Welfare**

Unrestricted immigration until late 1950, a grossly overcrowded population, local sensitivity to political and military events elsewhere and also to the effects of natural disasters in nearby China and the fact that the majority of Hong Kong residents do not think of Hong Kong as their real home, increases the problems of constructive social welfare work.

A great deal of the Colony's social welfare and charitable work is carried out by over sixty voluntary organisations. Government provides heavy indirect subventions to many of these and in addition makes cash grants to nearly thirty of them through the Social Welfare Office.

The Government Social Welfare Office was established in August, 1947, as a specialised sub-department of the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs. Its principal responsibilities are:

(a) the Probation Service, which includes the development of remand homes, probation hostels and approved schools;

(b) public assistance work, which includes relief in cash or kind, the administration of welfare centres, emergency relief work after fires and typhoons, relief camps and repatriation;

(c) child welfare, which includes liaison with orphanages, home visiting, care and protection of deprived children, and liaison with voluntary organizations;

(d) liaison with all voluntary youth welfare organizations and boys' and girls' clubs, and certain aspects of vocational training;

(e) promotion of community welfare through urban neighbourhood associations;

(f) moral welfare work with special attention to juvenile prostitution;

(g) training of social workers, and the welfare of seamen, displaced persons, the aged and attempted suicides.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Internal Communications**

Through passenger services to Canton were suspended in October, 1949, after the change of administration in Canton and have not yet been resumed although goods trains run between the Colony and Shanghai.

The total number of passengers carried for the year ending 31st March, 1951, on the British Section of the Kowloon-Canton Railway amounted to 6,055,398. Goods tonnage totalled 371,790 tons. The gross receipts amounted to $10,366,797.

There are efficient taxi services, rickshaws and a few remaining sedan chairs in the Colony.

**Shipping**

Since 1945 the harbour has been almost entirely cleared of wrecks; and the lights, moorings, wharfage and dockyard facilities have been restored to their pre-war efficiency. Hong Kong's record for rapid cargo-handling and quick turn round of shipping compares favourably with that of any other port in the Far East.

Owing to unsettled political conditions in China, the coastal trade from Hong Kong represents only a fraction of the tonnage engaged on this service.
before the war, and those same conditions have caused the disruption of the trade to Canton and other river ports.

The revival of the ocean trade to and from Hong Kong since the end of the war has been remarkable, and successive years have shown increases up till 1951. Although the tonnage figures for ocean-going vessels show a slight decline during the last year, the cargo which these vessels loaded and discharged was 496,935 tons greater than the previous year. The past year has also shown a remarkable increase in the tonnage of junks and launches using the port.

The net tonnages of vessels entered and cleared for the year ending 31st March, 1951, were as follows:

| Type of Vessel          | Tonnage |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Ocean-going vessels     | 17,773,362 |
| River steamers          | 4,655,428 |
| Junk and launches       | 4,415,356 |
| **Total**               | **26,844,346** |

**Air**

In the year ending March, 1951, 73,064 passengers used the Airport and 5,290 aircraft arrived or departed on international flights. The airfield provides two runways, one of which has been extended to constitute the maximum length of 5,418 feet; both are surfaced with asphalt on a concrete base. The largest aircraft using it are the Douglas DC-6. Canadairs and Constellations call regularly on scheduled air services. The adjacent marine base is suitable for all types of flying-boats.

A survey party from the United Kingdom Ministry of Civil Aviation has recently been studying the possibility of improving the present airport to enable it to cater for larger aircraft by the extension of existing, and construction of new, runways.

**Telecommunications and Telephones**

An extension of the radioplane network to cover South Korea, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and North Borneo is projected.

New and up-to-date broadcasting studios are now situated on the top floor of Electra House (Cable and Wireless).

**PUBLIC FINANCE**

(See Note on page 27.)

For the financial year 1950–51 the Revenue of the Colony was $291,599,484 and the Expenditure, $251,677,495. Duties, Earnings and Profits Tax and Assessed Taxes (Rates) accounted for a revenue of approximately $147½ million (£9,250,000) in 1950–51.

**Public Debt**

The Public Debt of the Colony as at 31st March, 1951, totalled $64,632,000.

**TRADE**

(See Note on page 27.)

In 1950 the value of the Colony’s imports was $3,787,700,000 and that of its exports was $3,715,600,000.

The volume of trade in 1950 thus showed an increase of over 48 per cent. as compared with 1949 and is a record in the Colony’s history.

This increase is due in part to the disposal from congested godowns of goods which had been diverted to Hong Kong by reason of the unsettled conditions in China in 1949. In addition the figures, which relate to value only, must be discounted to some extent in view of the rise in prices of both raw materials and finished goods.

Trade with the United Kingdom increased by 8·6 per cent. as compared with 1949.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Government issues of coins comprise coins of 50, 10 and 5 cents in nickel brass.

The authorised banks for dealing in foreign exchange listed under this heading in *The Colonial Office List* 1951 should now be amended as follows:

Delete “Chase Bank”, For “Nederlandsch-Indische Handelsbank” read “Nationale Handelsbank N.V.”. Delete “Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank” and insert “Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited”.
