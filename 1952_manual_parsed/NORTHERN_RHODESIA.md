SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

European. At the end of 1950 there were 22 Government schools in the territory. Of these, seven offered primary education up to Standard 5 and secondary education up to Form III. Two others, while offering the full primary range, continued to Form II only. Eight schools provided instruction only within the primary range, four from K.G. to Standard 5 and four from K.G. to Standard 2. There were five Infants’ Schools. The total enrolment at Government schools was 4,748.
Certain controlled schools under private management catered for children below the permissive school age and others offered instruction within the Government school range. In addition the Lusaka Dominican Convent High School offered secondary education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard (Form IV). The total enrolment at controlled schools under private management was 1,141 including 229 children below the permissive school age.

Boarding accommodation was available at four Government schools and four private schools. In addition there were, in connection with Government schools, three aided private hostels.

By arrangement with the Southern Rhodesia Education Department correspondence tuition was provided as required for 61 children (mainly six to eight years old) living more than three miles from the nearest day school.

Coloured and Asiatic. Katapola School, under Government management, offered education for coloured children in the primary range. There were four private government-aided Indian schools.

African. In 1950 there were 1,273 schools receiving grants-in-aid including 96 native authority schools. There are 50 Government schools.

The estimated expenditure on African Education for 1951 is £498,974, of which £252,150 is grants-in-aid for recurrent expenditure. In addition, the sum of £159,807 is estimated to be spent under the Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme.

Information Services

With regard to wireless programmes, the small-scale rediffusion experiment which was initiated in the main African area in Lusaka has proved very successful.

Owing to an improvement in the housing position it was possible to fill some vacancies in the Broadcasting (Engineers) Section of the Information Department and with the delivery of equipment the development of the transmission side of broadcasting has shown very satisfactory progress.

The 15 kw. transmitter has been installed.

Plans for extensions to studios and transmitters which will allow simultaneous broadcasting in several languages have been implemented.

Now that mobile recording equipment has arrived programmes of African plays and music are being expanded and new and outstanding material is being provided.

With regard to the development of the tourist industry, for which the Information Department is also responsible, a big-game safari scheme for a limited number of hunters is now in operation.

Labour

The number of persons in employment in mines, sawmills, railways and the Public Works Department in the territory in 1950 was 6,250 Europeans and 57,300 Africans. A further 8,000 Europeans and 125,000 Africans (estimated) were engaged in other forms of employment in the territory.

In the principal industry in the country (copper mining) the average monthly wages, exclusive of bonuses, cost-of-living allowance and overtime, etc., for Europeans were £48·48 (surface) and £54·02 (underground) and for Africans 62s. 2d. (surface) and 75s. 11d. (underground). To these earnings, which represent little more than half of the total remuneration, must be added the value of sub-economic rents of housing etc., enjoyed by Europeans and free housing and food provided for Africans.

Wage rates in other industries and occupations continued to rise during 1950 but so did the cost of living. The index stood at 156 at the end of the year (1939 = 100).

The year brought two major disputes between the African Mineworkers' Trade Union and the four Copper Mining Companies. The first, relating to wage increases, was settled but the second, relating to the question of a profit-sharing scheme for African employees, was unresolved at the end of the year.

Disputes applying to the whole Territory occurred between the Northern Rhodesia African Drivers' Trade Union and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and between the Northern Rhodesia African Shop Assistants' Trade Union and the same body during the year. Both were settled.

During the year there were three strikes by European workers and 71 by African workers. In the case of the latter the strikes were almost all of short duration, and were resolved on the spot by local Labour Officers. The total man-days lost by African workers amounted to 6,124 in strikes involving 4,777 workers. 1,732 Europeans lost 2,522 man-days.

The dispute inherited from 1949 between the Mine Workers' Union, supported by the African Mineworkers' Trade Union and the four Copper Mining Companies, over shorter working hours in the copper mining industry, was submitted to a Board of Inquiry which sat at Kitwe in September. The Board's report was published later in the year, and recommended that the normal weekly working hours should not be reduced to 40, but that they should not exceed 48, which they do at present, in some cases. The Board also recommended an extra annual paid holiday, and extended travelling time for European employees proceeding on leave. The Board also advised against the introduction of compulsory arbitration for disputes in the mining industry following upon the failure of conciliation.

Trade Unionism continued to spread amongst African workers, and by the end of the year there were seven Trade Unions. The number of European employee representative bodies remained at four, with a like number of Associations representing employers.

As a result of negotiations between the Northern Rhodesia Master Builders' and Allied Trades Association and the Northern Rhodesia General Workers' Trade Union, a very comprehensive agreement covering wages and conditions of employment was reached. This agreement lays down, for the first time in the building industry, uniform rates of wages, a 48-hour week, payment rate of time and a half for overtime, three paid Public Holidays per year, and provision for paid annual leave. The Agreement also provides for the payment to all employees of an inclusive wage in place of the old arrangement of cash wage plus food ration. The inclusive wage now includes a cash equivalent of rations and, in order to assist labourers in the new idea of feeding themselves, this cash equivalent is paid weekly. The balance of wages is paid at the end of the month or the ticket, as the case may be. This experiment appears to be working very well, and it also seems to have some effect in combating absenteeism.
A further big step forward in industrial relations has been taken by both sides in the building industry in the setting up of a Joint Industrial Council.

One of the most important Ordinances affecting both African and European labour introduced during the year was the Silicosis Ordinance (No. 27 of 1950), which was brought into operation on 1st November, 1950.

On 10th July, 1950, the Apprenticeship (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 6 of 1950) was enacted. This was designed to prevent articles and certificates of apprenticeship being given except under the Ordinance.

The scope of the Apprenticeship Ordinance was considerably widened on 3rd October, 1950, by the schedule of trades being made applicable to all industries and undertakings, including the Government of Northern Rhodesia.

The Employment of Natives (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 9 of 1950) enacted on 21st July, 1950, provided that an African employee might, with the approval of the Commissioner for Labour and Mines and with his own consent, be charged rent for housing provided for him by his employer. This amendment was introduced to meet the wishes of Africans for an inclusive wage system and approval was given in the first instance only in respect of the higher grades of mine employees.

The Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children (Amendment) Ordinance (No. 49 of 1950) was introduced to carry out more effectively the intention of Ordinance No. 45 of 1949, to prevent the employment of young persons between the ages of twelve and sixteen in industrial undertakings without permission. This Ordinance had not come into operation at the end of the year.

Under the provisions of the Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance, 1949, the Trade Unions (Registration) Regulations, 1950, were made by the Governor in Council on 13th May, 1950. The Regulations prescribed the manner of application for registration of a Trade Union, the forms to be used, the making of annual returns and the fees payable.

The Employment of Natives Regulations were amended on 4th July, 1950, to permit the Director of Medical Services and the Commissioner for Labour and Mines to approve, subject to certain safeguards, temporary buildings to be used for a period of not more than ten years, provided that each year after the second year a Labour Officer and a Medical Officer jointly certified that these buildings were fit for human habitation.

The staff of the Labour Branch of the Department, excluding officers engaged purely on clerical duties, was 20, in the Trade Testing branch three officers, in the Apprenticeship branch one officer; the Workmen's Compensation Commissioner, who was also a member of the Department, performed the duties of Controller of Apprenticeship in addition to his other duties.

For the purpose of the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance a workman is now, with certain exceptions, an employee whose earnings do not exceed £1,200 per annum (as compared with £950 per annum previously).

Welfare

Government employs three women Welfare Officers and one male Welfare Officer, although no department of Social Welfare has yet been formed.

The Salvation Army operates a Home of Refuge for European children and an Old Men's Home. Both Homes are at Ndola. An additional children's home was opened during 1951 and is operated by the Diocese of Northern Rhodesia. This home is also at Ndola.

African welfare in urban areas is very largely the concern of local Government authorities and of large employers of labour, who employ both European and African Welfare Officers. The duties of these officers include the organisation of sport and general recreational activities, youth clubs, handicrafts, libraries, etc.

A number of patriotic and charitable bodies exist. All appeals for charitable purposes are conducted by the Central Charities Committee, a non-official body set up for the purpose.

Compassionate and old age allowances are payable to Europeans who fulfil the necessary conditions.

THE RHODES-LIVINGSTONE INSTITUTE

The Rhodes-Livingstone Institute was founded in 1937 by Sir Hubert Young to undertake sociological research in Central Africa. Its funds are drawn partly from private donations and partly from a Government grant and it has also received a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. During 1950, members of the Institute were studying the Lunda, Yao, Shona and Ndebele peoples, besides problems of African urban life and the economic life of the Tonga people. The Institute also publishes a number of occasional papers on anthropology and related subjects.

COMMUNICATIONS

Aviation

The Air Pilot of Northern Rhodesia (1950 Edition) together with the Air Law (1951 Edition) provide detailed information on aviation in Northern Rhodesia.

One International and three National Airports lying along the North/South corridor route throughout the territory provide Customs, Health and Immigration controls as well as fuel, Air Traffic Control, radio and radio navigation aids. In all, 42 airfields are maintained, of which 14 are constructed for use in all weathers.

Central African Airways provide both regional and internal scheduled services with a fleet of aircraft consisting of 7 Vikings, 5 Doves and 4 Beavers.

They operate routes as follows:

(a) Internal

(i) Lusaka, Fort Jameson—Thrice weekly each way (with additional weekly excursion to Monkey Bay).

(ii) Lusaka, Livingstone—Twice weekly each way.

(iii) Lusaka, Mankoya, Mongu, Kalabo, Balovale, Livingstone—Twice weekly.

(iv) Lusaka, Broken Hill*, Ndola, Kasama, Abercorn—Five times weekly each way.

* Flagstop.
(b) Regional Services

(i) Johannesburg, Salisbury, Lusaka, Ndola, Kasama, Abercorn, Tabara, Nairobi.

(ii) Johannesburg, Livingstone, Lusaka, Ndola—Twice weekly each way.

(iii) Johannesburg, Blantyre, Dar-es-Salaam, Nairobi—Twice weekly.

(iv) Fort Jameson, Lilongwi, Blantyre—Twice weekly.

East African Airways connect Fort Jameson with Nairobi, Salisbury and Blantyre twice weekly. Zambesi Airways is, at present, the only Charter operator in the Territory and is based at Livingstone, using Rapids, Fox Moths and Fairchild aircraft.

The Northern Rhodesia Flying Club retains its main activities on the copperbelt but with zonal branches at Lusaka and Livingstone.

Posts, Telegraphs and Wireless

The daily mail service by rail between post offices on the line of rail is now supplemented by air mails between certain main centres.

The South African Airways (Springbok Service) handling airmails for overseas countries now operates three times a week.

There are now 66 post offices (including one mobile post office), 15 of which are money order offices and 56 telegraph offices. The main telegraph and trunk route lies alongside the railway line from the Victoria Falls to Chingola with branches from Kitwe to Mufulira, and from Ndola to Luanshya and the Belgian Congo Border. There is also a radio telephone link between Lusaka and Fort Jameson.

Wireless stations at Abercorn, Balovale, Broken Hill, Chinsali, Feira, Fort Jameson, Fort Rosebery, Isoka, Kasama, Kasempa, Kawambwa, Livingstone, Lundazi, Luwingu, Mankoya, Mkoshi, Mongu, Mpika, Mporokoso, Mumbwa, Mwinilunga, Nakonde, Namwala, Ndola, Petauke, Ridgeway (Lusaka), Senanga, Serenje, Sesheke, Solwezi and Shiwangandu maintain a public service.

PUBLIC FINANCE

(See Note on page 27.)

The actual Revenue in 1950 was £12,059,220 and the Expenditure £10,591,694 (excluding development).

The estimated figures for 1951 were £14,417,630 and £14,375,310 (excluding development) respectively.

Loan expenditure for development purposes was £2,213,311 during 1950 and the total of such expenditure to the end of 1950 was £5,369,571.

The estimated loan expenditure for development during 1951 was £1,586,303.

Revenue

With regard to rates of income tax given under this sub-heading in The Colonial Office List 1951, the deduction allowed from total income in respect of children is now £150 for each child. The maximum deduction in respect of Life, Accident and Sickness Insurance is now also £150.

The Customs Revenue is expected to exceed £1,925,000 in 1951.

Public Debt.

The public debt as at 31st December, 1950, was £4,637,000.

Sinking Funds

The total balance in the funds as at the 31st December, 1950, was £425,539.

TRADE AND INDUSTRY

Agriculture

The total cattle population in 1950 was 907,000, an increase of 4% on the previous year. 136,000 were owned by Europeans and 771,000 by Africans. 600,000 of the African-owned cattle were in the Southern and Barotse Provinces.

Cattle prices were increased during the year, and 32,000 head were sold for slaughter. Supplies from Barotseland are increasing, and buying is now effected by the trade.

An outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease was controlled by the inoculation of 40,000 head with a heat-attenuated live virus. 20,000 doses of phenanthridinium were issued for the control of trypanosomiasis, and 270,000 doses of anthrax vaccine were supplied.

The greater portion of the territory is undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in its food supply, nearly the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little general trade in food commodities except in the railway belt where the surplus native maize crop is marketed by the Maize Control Board. This surplus in 1950 amounted to 359,000 bags. The staple native cereals are finger millet (Eleusine coracana), Kaffir corn (Sorghum) and maize. The millet is produced over extensive tracts of the territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby grain crops are grown in rotation with forest re-growths. Other native crops are bullrush millet (Pennisetum typhoideum), groundnuts, cassava, sweet potatoes and a variety of curcurbits and legumes.

Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but mainly on a small scale for private consumption, except in the Petauke District of the Eastern
Province where there is a flourishing Burley tobacco industry with a production of 327,000 lb. in 1950. The industry is now organised on co-operative lines.

In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management. In the Fort Jameson district there is also a large area taken up by European farmers mainly engaged in tobacco growing.

Maize and tobacco are the chief crops of the settler. In the season 1949/50 the total maize on the line of rail was 571,000 bags. The season was favourable for maize growing and there was also an increase in the acreage planted over the previous season.

Wheat growing under irrigation has almost disappeared, production in 1950 being only 3,200 bags. Farmers are finding potato, onion and vegetable growing more lucrative than wheat growing.

Tobacco growers enjoyed a favourable season. The Eastern area crop reached a figure of 3,214,500 lb., while in the Western area the production was 2,956,000 lb.

Turkish tobacco production in the Western tobacco area continued at the low level of the previous year, only 100,000 lb. being produced in 1950.

The Headquarters of the Department of Agriculture are at Lusaka.

Forestry

The declared Forest Reserves and Protected Forest Areas now total 2,155 sq. miles.

The mining companies cut in 1950 a further 1,281,200 cubic feet of local timber and another 580,000 cubic feet was cut in the territory for minor industries. Other recorded consumption in 1950 included 371,800 poles and 524,000 cords of firewood.

The staff of the Forestry Branch of the Department of Agriculture had increased to 16 professional, 21 technical and 5 clerical European officers and a permanent staff of 255 Africans besides casual labour by the end of 1950.

Land Settlement

Crown land is now granted only on lease, normally for terms of 999 years in the case of farms and 99 years in the case of plots in townships and residential smallholdings, although in special circumstances, leases are granted for shorter periods. As regards agricultural land, preliminary leases are granted in the first instance, the term being 2 years for farms and 3 years for agricultural smallholdings (i.e. areas up to 300 acres). Personal occupation is required by lessees of farms. If the lessee develops his land to the satisfaction of the Crown, on the expiration of his preliminary lease he is granted a lease for 999 years.

Crown land suitable for mixed farming, ranching and tobacco-growing is available within easy reach of the railway, though good mixed farming land is now becoming scarce. All farms are unimproved and valuations range from 6s. 8d. to 30s. per acre. Some privately-owned freehold farms are in the market at prices ranging from £2 to £10 or more per acre according to the degree of development. A settler must be in possession of at least £3,000 capital actually available for farming purposes in order to obtain a grant of a leasehold farm from Government. In approved cases, however, New Settlement Loans of up to £1,500 are granted by the Land Board. Applications for Crown land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Deputy Director of Surveys and Lands, Livingstone.

Minerals

The Department of Mines administers the Mining Ordinance, the Mining and Explosives Regulations, the Mining (Silicosis Prevention) Regulations, the Winding Engine Driver's (Certificate of Competency) Regulations, the Gold Trade Ordinance and the Factories Ordinance and Factories (Safety) Regulations. The Registration of mining titles is carried out by the Registrar of Titles in the Department of Surveys and Lands.

The copper produced in the territory in 1950 totalled 276,433 tons, valued at £43,410,364 against 259,081 tons valued at £31,255,168 in 1949. The production of the various copper mines in 1950 was — Mufulira, 81,317 tons of blister copper; Nchanga, 34,545 tons of blister copper, 10,529 tons of electrolytic copper, and 259 tons of copper concentrates which were sold as concentrates; Nkana, 11,938 tons of blister copper, 67,144 tons of electrolytic copper and 30 tons of copper (other); Roan Antelope, 70,957 tons of blister copper. As a by-product Nkana also produced 34,914 cwts. of cobalt alloy and 1,296 ozs. of gold, 173,304 ozs. of silver and 27,056 lbs. of selenium, which were recovered from refinery slimes.

Lead, zinc and vanadium are produced at Broken Hill, but no vanadium was recovered during 1950.

Some of the lead is fabricated at the mine into pipes and sheets for use in the metallurgical plants at Broken Hill and at the copper mines. No iron ore was mined during 1950. Iron ore and manganese ore are used as reagents in the production of lead and zinc. The value of the major products from Broken Hill during 1950 was: lead, £1,537,559, zinc, £3,126,650. Other mineral activities are on a small scale.

The mineral production for the years 1949 and 1950 was:

| Mineral          | 1949   | 1950   |
|------------------|--------|--------|
| Gold             | ozs.   | 1,186  | 1,432  |

| Mica (sheet)     | lbs.   | 6,672  | 4,409  |
| Silica rock      | tons   | 1,203  | 165    |

The minerals produced during 1949 were valued at £35,579,543 and those produced during 1950 were valued at £49,323,187.
Imports and Exports

In 1950 the f.o.b. value of total imports was £26,710,475 and the f.o.r. value of total exports £49,941,724. (These figures include Government Stores but exclude Specie.)
