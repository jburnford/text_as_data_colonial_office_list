NIGERIA

See pages 275–302 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

CONSTITUTION

A new Constitution for Nigeria was approved on the 29th June, 1951. The Territory is divided into three Regions, the Northern, Eastern and Western Regions, with Lagos and the Colony included in the Western Region. The Territory of the Cameroons is administered as an integral part of Nigeria in accordance with a Trusteeship Agreement dated 14th December, 1946.

The provisions of the new Constitution are recorded in the Nigeria (Constitution) Order in Council, 1951, and in the Nigeria (Supplementary Provisions) Order in Council, 1951. New Letters Patent and Royal Instructions were also issued during the year. The Supplementary Provisions Order in Council creates three offices of Lieutenant-Governor, one for each Region, replacing the previous offices of Chief Commissioner of the Northern, Eastern and Western Provinces.

The Constitution now provides for a Legislature in each Region and for a Central Legislature for the whole Territory. In the Northern and Western Regions the Regional Legislature consists of a House of Chiefs and a House of Assembly, and in the Eastern Region there is a single House, the House of Assembly. The Northern House of Chiefs consists of the Lieutenant-Governor as President, three official members, 50 Chiefs, and an Adviser on Moslem Law. The Northern House of Assembly consists of a President, 4 official members, 90 elected members, and special members up to a maximum of 10. The Western House of Chiefs consists of the Lieutenant-Governor as President, 3 official members, and 50 Chiefs. The Western House of Assembly consists of a President, 4 official members, 80 elected members and special members up to a maximum of 3. The Eastern House of Assembly consists of the Lieutenant-Governor as President, 5 official members, 80 elected members and special members up to a maximum of 3.

The Central Legislature consists of a House of Representatives of 148 members. Of these members 68 are elected by the two Houses of the Northern Legislature, 34 by the Western Legislature, and 34 by the Eastern House of Assembly. There are also 6 members to represent interests and communities not otherwise adequately represented, and 6 official members, being the Chief Secretary, the three Lieutenant-Governors, the Attorney-General, and the Financial Secretary.

In each Region there is a Regional Executive Council of which the Lieutenant-Governor is President. Each of these Councils contains also 3 ex-officio members and between 6 and 9 Ministers (between 7 and 9 in the case of the Eastern Region) selected from amongst members of the Legislatures.

At the Centre there is a Council of Ministers consisting of the Governor as President, the 6 official members of the House of Representatives, and 12 Ministers selected from amongst members of the House of Representatives in such a way that each of the three Regions shall be represented by 4 Ministers.

The Regional Legislatures have legislative jurisdiction over a specified range of subjects, of which the most important are Agriculture, Animal Health, Fisheries, Forestry, Local Industries, Co-operative Societies, Social Welfare, Education,
Regional Public Works, Town and Country Planning, Customary Land Tenure and certain other Land matters. The Central Legislature has legislative jurisdiction on all subjects including those listed for Regional jurisdiction.

The principal function of the Executive Councils in the Regions and of the Council of Ministers at the Centre is to be the principal instrument of policy in respect of matters to which the jurisdiction of the Legislature extends.

Elected members of the Regional Houses of Assembly are elected by a process of indirect election. The stages in this process vary in each of the three Regions. Voters must be persons of the age of 21 years or upwards, being British subjects or protected persons, and either resident in, or natives of, the area in which they wish to vote. They must also either have paid tax in Nigeria or have been exempted from payment. In the Northern Region there is a further restriction of the franchise to males.

In the exercise of the prerogative power of pardon the Governor is advised by a small Privy Council composed of persons specially appointed for this purpose.

**ADMINISTRATION**

Nigeria is divided for administrative purposes into the Northern, Western and Eastern Regions. The Northern and Eastern Regions are identical with the former Northern and Eastern Provinces, but the Western Region includes the Colony as well as the former Western Provinces.

The Northern Region consists of the provinces of Adamawa, Bauchi, Benue, Bornu, Ilorin, Kabba, Kano, Katsina, Niger, Plateau, Sokoto and Zaria.

The Western Region consists of the Colony, and the provinces of Abeokuta, Benin, Ibadan, Ijebu, Oyo, Ondo and Warri.

The Eastern Region consists of the provinces of Calabar, Cameroons, Bamenda, Ogoja, Onitsha, Owerri and Rivers.

The provinces are each partitioned into divisions.

The seat of Central Government and place of residence of the Governor is Lagos. Each of the Regions is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor responsible to the Governor, the seats of administration being Kaduna (Northern Region), Enugu (Eastern Region), and Ibadan (Western Region). The Cameroons and Bamenda provinces are administered by the Commissioner of the Cameroons, who is responsible to the Lieutenant-Governor, Eastern Region.

Each province is under the control of a Resident, assisted by a staff of district officers and assistant district officers who have charge of the various divisions into which the province is divided. The Residents and their assistants are responsible for the detailed administration of the country.

**Native Authorities**—In the early days of administration in the Northern Provinces the system known as "indirect rule" was set up. The effect of this system is that today the functions of local government are for the most part carried out through native chiefs and councils with the assistance of the British administrative staff. The native authorities are responsible, through the administrative staff, to the Government for the peace and good order of their respective areas. Certain essential services have been undertaken by the native authorities and maintained out of the revenue obtained from a share of the taxes collected by them, together with the whole of the native court receipts and various minor fees. The revenue of each native treasury is shown in annual estimates, together with the expenditure for the year, drawn up with the advice of the administrative staff and approved by the Lieutenant-Governor of the region.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Posts and Telegraphs**

There is now an internal air letter service in the territory.

**PUBLIC FINANCE AND TAXATION**

(See note on page 27.)

**Revenue and Expenditure**

As will be seen from the figures given below the cost and extent of public services has risen greatly since before the 1939-1945 War. The increases have been met by raising the rates of direct and indirect tax levied upon a considerably greater volume of imports and exports and higher personal incomes.

In 1938-39 Revenue was some £6 million and Expenditure (omitting earnings and expenditure of the Nigerian Railway) some £7 million. Including Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes, financed by the U.K. Government, but excluding Nigerian Railway figures, Revenue and Expenditure totals for recent years are as follows:

| Year    | Revenue   | Expenditure | Surplus (+) or Deficit (-) |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1947-48 | £18,404,163 | £17,185,940 | + £1,218,223               |
| 1948-49 | £23,811,381 | £23,898,427 | - £87,046                 |
| 1949-50 | £30,764,681 | £28,253,090 | + £2,511,591               |
| 1950-51 | £32,213,855 | £30,168,040 (Est.) | + £2,045,815             |
| 1951-52 | £36,225,990 | £35,907,350 (Est.) | + £318,640               |

The General Revenue Balance (surplus) at the 31st March, 1951 amounted to £13,723,595. In addition, £6,564,544 was standing to the credit of the Revenue Equalisation Fund at that date.

The chief sources of revenue are Import, Export and Excise Duties which, in 1950-51 provided £18 million and Direct Taxes which provided £5 million, the balance being made up of such items as revenue from the Marine, Posts and Telegraphs, Electricity and other Government Departments, Mining Royalties, Fees and Licences.

The chief items of expenditure fall into two groups; expenditure on Services, Works and Departments, on the one hand, and expenditure...
on Development and Welfare schemes on the other. Of the first group, nearly £10 millions of the expenditure for 1951/52 is attributable to the cost of Defence, the Police, Marine Works and Services, Pensions and Gratuities, Posts and Telegraphs, Public Works, Agriculture and Forestry, Education, Electrical Works and Services, and Medical and Veterinary Services.

Expenditure on the second group, Development and Welfare, is financed jointly from Nigerian Revenue and Loans and from Colonial Development and Welfare Grants.

During 1951/52 more than £4 millions was provided in grants, and a further £1.6 millions was found from revenue. Schemes for improvement and advance in Agriculture, Industry, Education, Medical Services, Leprosy Control, and Water Supplies were among those planned for 1951/52, together with assistance for a number of research projects.

Public Debt.

At 31st March, 1951, the total Funded Debt amounted to £14,438,000 and the relative Sinking Funds totalled £3,670,094.

The annual charges on these loans are:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Interest       | 484,640 |
| Statutory Sinking Fund | 148,880 |

£633,520

These charges represent 2 per cent. of the estimated total ordinary expenditure for 1951/52.

During 1949, two loans raised in 1919 and 1930 respectively totalling £10,626,599 were redeemed.

In addition to the funded debt, Government has obtained loans from other sources, the balances of which at 31st March, 1951 were as follows:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Colonial Development & Welfare Scheme D.549 | 25,000 (Interest free). |
| Cocoa Marketing Board | 2,663,336 (with interest per annum repayable by 80 equated half yearly instalments). |
| University College, Ibadan | 475,000 (with interest at 3% per annum repayable in 24/40 years.) |

Total £3,163,336

Assets other than the Statutory Sinking Funds at 31st March, 1951 comprised:

|                | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| West African Airways Corporation Debentures | 452,200 |
| Investments in Niger Agricultural Projects Ltd. | 118,750 |

£570,950

Direct Taxation

Two forms of direct taxation are in force, income tax and general tax.

Early in 1948 an arrangement was made with H.M. Government for the avoidance of double taxation, with retrospective effect from April, 1946. The main result of this arrangement, which is in line with similar arrangements made by H.M. Government with other countries including the U.S.A., Canada, Australia and a number of Colonies, is that the profits of a British trading concern having a permanent establishment in Nigeria bear the full rate of Nigerian Income Tax, the burden of relieving the resultant double taxation being borne by the U.K. Similar arrangements were made in 1950 with the Governments of the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and the Gambia, with effect from April, 1950.

Revenue Derived from Income Tax:

Individuals and Companies

Revised figures are:

| Year     | £       |
|----------|---------|
| 1949–50 | 4,452,438 |
| 1950–51 | 4,525,000 (estimated) |
| 1951–52 | 4,150,000 (estimated) |

Secondary Industries. The largest factories in the country are the African Plywood and Timber Co. at Sapele; the factory of the British-American Tobacco Co. at Ibadan which produces 700 million cigarettes a year; and a soap factory and a brewery both at Apapa. Other industries of importance are:

(i) Groundnut Mills: There are three groundnut mills operating in Kano under private enterprise with a total throughput of some 20,000 tons of groundnuts per year.

(ii) Palm Oil Mills: Each with a throughput of 1,000 to 2,000 tons of fruit per annum. 9,250 tons of fruit were handled during 1950/51 representing sales of oil and kernels to the value to £90,000.
