Education

The various missionary societies continue to play a leading part in the educational system of the Protectorate. In 1950 there were 1,352 Government or grant-aided African primary schools and of these 1,295 were Mission-owned. The total number of children attending these schools was 158,900, of whom 37,800 were girls. It is not possible to obtain accurate figures for Mission or Muslim schools not aided by Government, but it is estimated that these may contain up to the same number of pupils as those in the aided system. There were in 1950 50 Government or aided African secondary schools, of which 41 were Mission-owned. These schools contained 5,056 pupils, of whom 645 were girls.

The education of the Asian community was provided for by eight Government and 70 aided schools, of which 74 were primary and four secondary. These schools contained 7,012 pupils (3,195 girls) in primary and 1,251 (302 girls) in secondary classes.

European primary schools in Uganda contained 232 pupils and a further 304 European children attended primary and secondary schools in Kenya. 1,896 students were undergoing training at the 41 Primary and Vernacular Teacher Training Centres.

In the field of higher education, Makerere College, which is situated in Uganda, is an autonomous institution financed by the East African Governments, with assistance under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. In 1950 this College was admitted to special relations with the University of London and was recognised as the University College of East Africa. In that year the College had 230 students including seven women; 82 men and five women were from Uganda.

Four Government scholars returned from study overseas during 1950, eight scholars began their studies overseas and some 12 more were chosen for the 1951 session.

PUBLIC FINANCE

(See Note on page 27.)

The main sources of revenue are Export Taxes (principally on cotton and coffee), Customs and Excise, Income Tax and Native and Non-Native Poll Tax. The revised 1950 revenue estimates for Export Taxes were £4,040,753, and for Customs and Excise, £2,389,000. The corresponding figures for 1951 are £7,593,500 and £3,478,000. The Public Debt consists of £850,000 of Uganda Government 3½ per cent. inscribed stock, 1955–1965, raised under Ordinances Nos. 1 of 1932 and 24 of 1937, and £3,100,000 of Uganda Government 3½ per cent. inscribed stock, 1966–1969, raised under Ordinance No. 8 of 1950. The unit of currency is the East African Shilling.

The figures for Revenue and Expenditure for 1949 in the table on page 402 of The Colonial Office List 1951 should be replaced by:—"Revenue: £8,094,381" and "Expenditure: £6,686,863." The figures for 1950 are £9,905,164 and £7,999,440 respectively and for 1951, £14,733,314 and £12,804,803 respectively.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

To the list of branches of the National Bank of India, Ltd., given under this heading in The Colonial Office List 1951 should be added Masaka, Jinja, Soroti and Fort Portal; to the list of branches of the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., should be added Masaka and Soroti; and to those of Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.), Tororo and Fort Portal.

PRODUCTION AND TRADE

The principal economic crops of Uganda are cotton and coffee. Cotton, which is cultivated almost entirely by Africans, is grown as a rain crop without the assistance of irrigation, with the result that there is a somewhat wide variation from year to year in the total crop produced. But the general level of production shows a steady upward trend. In the 1949/50 season 1,628,000 acres were planted. This was the second highest acreage ever attained in the Protectorate and yielded a crop amounting to 342,000 bales.
Both Robusta and Arabica varieties of coffee are grown, production in 1949/50 exceeding 32,000 tons. Other economic crops are groundnuts, tobacco and tea. Salted fish and crocodile skins are important items of export. Recent investigations have shown that Uganda contains valuable mineral deposits including gold, copper, cobalt, wolfram, magnetite, apatite, niobium and zirconium.

The principal imports are cotton piece goods, agricultural and industrial machinery, motor vehicles, petroleum and oil. The following table gives comparative figures for the value of imports and exports in recent years:

| Year | Imports (£) | Exports (£) |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1938 | 2,992,974  | 4,668,966   |
| 1948 | 9,271,287  | 14,461,488  |
| 1949 | 12,271,287 | 23,805,322  |
| 1950 | 15,402,126 | 28,879,350  |
