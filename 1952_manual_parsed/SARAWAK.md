SOCIAL SERVICES

Information Services

The Government of Sarawak Information Service, which is a branch of the office of the Chief Secretary, was established in January, 1951, and has since that date been considerably expanded. G.S.I.S. conducts the Government's relations with the Sarawak and Malayan Press to which it supplies information and guidance on Government policy and activity, and co-ordinates official publicity campaigns. It produces two monthly newspapers in Malay and Iban and operates five mobile cinemas which give free shows to the public and to schools. It distributes pamphlets, newspapers, periodicals and posters in English, Malay and Chinese throughout the country, and has opened a public Information Reading Room in Kuching. It is hoped that more Reading Rooms will shortly be opened in other centres, which will be a base for community radio listening.

Welfare

A Social Welfare Council has also been established, which includes representatives of all the various organisations which are interested in this kind of work, as well as of the general public. The Council co-ordinates all existing voluntary social welfare activities in the Colony, sponsors such welfare projects as it approves of, and initiates new projects.

A Girls' Home was established at the end of 1950 and is being managed by the Salvation Army with financial assistance from the Government.

COMMUNICATIONS

Air

The new airport at Kuching, which possesses modern air radio and navigational aids, was officially opened to traffic in September, 1950.

Air communication with Singapore, Labuan, Jesselton and Sandakan is at present maintained by means of services four times weekly in each direction operated by Malayan Airways Dakota aircraft.
A new runway is under construction at Sibu mainly financed by Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Posts and Telegraphs

"Tatau" should be added to the list of Post Offices given under this sub-heading in The Colonial Office List 1951.

The air-mail service with Singapore, Labuan, Jesselton and Sandakan, maintained by aircraft of Messrs. Malayan Airways Ltd., is now operated four times weekly.

With regard to telegraph rates to Commonwealth countries, the Government Ordinary full rate is now 25 cents per word.

832 telephones are now connected in local centres of which 404 are in use in Government offices and bungalows.

PUBLIC FINANCE
(See Note on page 27.)

The Colony has no public debt. Approximately two-thirds of the revenue is derived from Customs import and export duties; other sources are excise duties, licences and taxes which include income tax on Companies and revenue from Government property. The only direct taxes levied on the native population are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year and the Malay "head tax" of $1 which is levied on all males of working age.

|       | From/to U.K. | From/to other British Countries | From/to U.S.A. | From/to other Countries | Total |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| Imports | 5,420,710    | 270,096,216                     | 232,072       | 13,581,706             | 289,330,704 |
| Exports | 8,533,008    | 225,810,422                     | 5,722,164     | 134,520,897            | 374,586,491 |

The apparently favourable trade balance for 1950 does not give a clear picture of the position as exports and re-exports of petroleum account for no less than $230,308,089 of the total exports. Similarly, $199,078,712 of the imports are accounted for by crude oil won in the neighbouring territory of Brunei and piped to the refinery in Sarawak. Crude oil actually won in Sarawak during the year 1950 amounted to 56,601 tons.

Next to petroleum, the chief imports are foodstuffs and manufactured goods, and the chief exports rubber, sago flour, pepper, timber, rattans, and jelutong.
