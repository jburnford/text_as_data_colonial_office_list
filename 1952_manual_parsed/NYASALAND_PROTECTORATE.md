NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

See pages 322–330 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The second sentence of the first paragraph under this heading in The Colonial Office List 1951, beginning "The south-eastern boundary..." should be disregarded.

The provinces of the Protectorate are subdivided into 17 administrative areas, each in charge of a district commissioner, who is also a district magistrate.

POPULATION

The estimated population at the end of 1950 was Europeans, 3,820; Asiatics, 5,248; Africans, 2,340,126.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

The Five-Year Educational Plan for the years 1950–54 is now in operation. The first Five-Year plan for 1945–49 aimed at laying the foundations of a ten-year expansion programme. During this period half the recurrent expenditure was met by the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund, whereas the whole recurrent cost of the second five years will be borne locally. As a result of the Educational Survey which was completed in 1950 and which covered all existing facilities for African primary education in every district, vital information has been acquired on a local basis of what is needed for the development and consolidation of the primary school system. An agreed expansion programme has been drawn up for each district detailing the development in each year from 1950–54.

The Governor is advised on education policy by four separate committees for African, European, Asian and Eurafican education. Each committee contains representatives of the section of the community concerned. Each administrative district has a School Committee which advises the Director of Education on local matters. Policy is implemented under the supervision of the Education Department which inspects all schools, controls and maintains Government schools, conducts Government and public examinations, and pays all local educational grants. The staff of the Department consists of 39 Europeans, 48 Africans, two Indians and two Euraficans. The total expenditure on Education for all races in 1950 amounted to £180,150.

Information Services

The Public Relations branch of the Secretariat was constituted as a separate Government Department in 1951.

COMMUNICATIONS

Postal

Air mails from and to adjoining countries and overseas are received and despatched daily, except Tuesdays.

There are now 50 post offices and 12 postal agencies in the Protectorate.

Telegraphs

The African trans-continental telegraph line has in the past provided the main trunk telegraph route between Southern Rhodesia and Tanganyika, with Zomba and Blantyre as the principal stations connected thereto. Telegraph facilities have, however, now been supplemented by the provision of radio teleprinter working between Zomba and Salisbury, and a hand speed radio link between Zomba–Lusaka and Zomba–Beira. Hand speed radio telegraph stations for internal communications have been provided at Zomba, Karonga, Likoma Island, Lilongwe, Mkhoma, Mzuzu, Kasungu, Mzimba, Njakwa, Fort Johnston and Salima.

Telephones

All towns in the Southern Province are connected by telephone and by the end of 1951 communication will also be established to Lilongwe and a number of points in the Central Province.

External telephone communications are provided for by means of a Zomba-Salisbury radio telephone link, which gives service to all parts of Southern Rhodesia, to certain parts of the Union of South Africa and to the port of Beira in Portuguese East Africa.
