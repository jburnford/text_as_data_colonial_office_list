GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Gold Coast Colony

The Southern Togoland Territorial Council fulfils functions similar to those of the Joint Provincial Council of Chiefs in the Colony, in respect of the southern section of Togoland under United Kingdom Trusteeship which is administered with the Colony.

HISTORY

Constitutional History from the Nineteenth Century

In 1948 a Commission of Enquiry was appointed to investigate the underlying causes of certain disturbances which had occurred earlier in that year. The Commission's recommendations included various proposals for constitutional reform; and as a result of His Majesty's Government's comments on the Commission's report, a fully representative all-African Committee was appointed to examine them. The Committee reported to the Governor in August, 1949; and after detailed study of its proposals a new constitution was drawn up which came into effect in January, 1951. The new constitution makes provision for a Legislative Assembly legislating for the whole of the Gold Coast and elected partly by constituencies and partly from the Territorial Councils of Chiefs. It also provides for an Executive Council of Ministers chosen from and approved by the Assembly. Three of the Ministers are officials. Certain reserve powers are retained by the Governor. The first elections, under a system of universal suffrage which was worked out for the constituencies, took place in February, 1951.

Economic and Social Developments

The social and economic history of the Gold Coast in the twentieth century has been accelerated by a number of influences and in particular by the spread of education and the development of the cocoa industry.
The prosperity of the various African companies for nearly four centuries depended in large measure on the slave trade. Its suppression in the nineteenth century, coinciding with the Ashanti wars, reduced commerce on the coast to straits from which it revived only temporarily when the security of Captain Maclean's administration fostered the development of the palm oil trade. Vegetable oils remained for several decades one of the principal objects of commerce on the coast. This and other trades were, however, displaced in importance by the cocoa industry which from small beginnings rapidly expanded in the new century until the Gold Coast became the world's largest producer, and cocoa the key to the country's prosperity. This prosperity is being threatened by swollen shoot, a serious and contagious virus disease of cocoa whose depredations constitute a grave menace to the economy of the country. A strenuous campaign based on the best scientific advice and research is being waged by Government and slow but steady progress is being made in the eradication of the diseased trees and the rehabilitation of the devastated areas. The marketing of cocoa has been undertaken since 1947 by the Government sponsored Gold Coast Cocoa Marketing Board.

From the days of the Portuguese, gold attracted to the coast adventurers of many nations; in recent times the prosperity of the Gold Coast has been increased by the discovery and working of diamonds, manganese and bauxite, and by the rapid expansion of the timber industry.

Takoradi Harbour, built during the Governorship of Sir Gordon Guggisberg and opened in 1928, has become the economic gateway of the country and contributes greatly to its prosperity and development.

The pioneers of education in the Gold Coast were the Wesleyan and Basel missions of the early nineteenth century. They were followed by many others, the Anglican, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic being prominent among them. Education was for many years left entirely to the missions, assisted in the latter part of the century by increasing subventions from Government. Throughout the present century Government, while continuing its aid to the missions, has also built many schools of its own, and Native Authorities have taken an increasingly prominent part in the extension of schooling facilities. Government has, in these and other ways, pursued a policy of wide educational expansion of which the opening of Achimota College in 1924 afforded remarkable evidence, and the establishment of the University College in 1948 a proof of a continued progress.

**CONSTITUTION**

The Constitutional instruments providing for the Government of the Gold Coast and setting up the constitution which came into effect on the 1st January, 1951, are the Gold Coast (Constitution) Order in Council, 1951; the Letters Patent, passed under the Great Seal of the Realm (constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief); the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast Order in Council, 1950; and the Instructions passed under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet to the Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President; three *ex officio* members, namely the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary; and not less than eight representative members, who are members of the Legislative Assembly proposed by the Governor and approved by the Assembly.

The Leader of the Government Business in the Legislative Assembly is elected by a majority of the Executive Council from among their number.

The Governor at his discretion may charge any member of the Executive Council with the responsibility of Government Departments. Members are known as Ministers. There is provision for Ministerial Secretaries to be appointed from among members of the Legislative Assembly and for a Permanent Secretary in each Ministry who will be a public officer appointed by the Governor.

The Legislative Assembly legislates for all Territories of the Gold Coast and consists of a Speaker, three *ex officio* members, namely the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary, three special members who represent the commercial interests of whom only one is permitted to vote, and three special members who represent mining interests also with only one vote. The seventy-five elected members are made up of thirty-three rural members, five municipal members, eleven territorial members elected by the Joint Provincial Council, six territorial members elected by the Asanteman Council, nineteen territorial members elected by the Electoral College of the Northern Territories formed out of the Northern Territories Territorial Council and one territorial member elected by the Southern Togoland Council.

The rural members are those elected by the people of constituencies whose boundaries were laid down in the Elections Ordinance, 1950, made under a special Order in Council for the purpose. This Ordinance laid down electoral procedure, of which the main provision is that elections in rural constituencies should take place by secret ballot in two stages.

In the first stage primary elections are held to choose representatives for local electoral colleges, which in the second stage choose one, or in certain cases two, representatives for each constituency. In order to qualify for registration to vote or for nomination as a candidate, an individual man or woman must be aged 21, a British subject and have a residential qualification of a minimum of six months. Literacy is not imposed as a qualification except in the case of candidates for the secondary elections.

The four municipalities of Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi/Takoradi and Cape Coast are represented by the urban members who are elected by direct election.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Primary education consists of a six-year course from which pupils may proceed further to a four-year senior primary course.

Secondary Education. In December, 1950, 426 candidates from Government-assisted institutions, including the Achimota School, passed the overseas School Certificate Examination of the University of Cambridge Local Examination Syndicate.

The University College of the Gold Coast. There were 182 students taking Intermediate and Degree Courses and 28 taking the Associate Course at the Institute of Education during the 1950–51 session.

The College of Technology, Science and Arts, Kumasi. The Ordinance to establish this College was passed in September, 1951; and some
students were expected to be in residence in January, 1952. The college will play an important part in the structure of education in the Gold Coast and will eventually have an enrolment of 2,000 students in residence. It will provide courses in engineering, agriculture, commercial subjects, medical auxiliary services, teacher-training in specialist subjects, and in other professions at post-secondary levels.

**Information Services**

The Public Relations Department is now organised in seven sections: Administrative, Publications, Programmes, Broadcast Engineering, Cinema, Films and Photographic.

The Broadcast Engineering Section is responsible for the efficient running and maintenance of 21 Wire Rediffusion Stations and the relaying of B.B.C. and Gold Coast programmes to over 10,000 subscribers.

The Gold Coast Broadcasting Station broadcasts daily except Sundays and Public Holidays between 10.30 a.m. and 12 noon and between 3.15 p.m. and 6 p.m., on 49·6 and 61·04 metres respectively.

The purpose of the Films Section (the Gold Coast Film Unit) is to focus interest, through films, on matters of national concern and to project the Gold Coast to the outside world. "Amenu's Child", one of the films made in 1950, won an award at the Venice International Film Festival. During 1951 the Unit produced three documentary films, the subjects being clean water supply, Post Office savings facilities and juvenile delinquency.

**Medical Facilities**

Shortage of Medical Officers is still acute, but the position has been somewhat eased by an amendment to the Medical Practitioners' and Dentists' Registration Ordinance whereby temporary licences can be issued to doctors with registrable qualifications to practise in localities where their services are needed.

Out-patients treated in Gold Coast hospitals in 1950 numbered 947,231; 734 major operations were performed at the Gold Coast Hospital in Accra.

The new Midwifery Training School at Kumasi now accommodates 32 pupil midwives.

The Nurses Training College at Accra is functioning well. In 1950, 14 student nurses passed the State Registration Examination, making the total number of passes since the commencement of the examination, 28.

Of the three proposed rural health centres the one at Kpandu has been completed and a Senior Health Sister posted there. The sites have been acquired and contracts placed for a second centre to be constructed at Effiduasi in Ashanti and a third at Bimbilla in the Northern Territories.

The Medical Field Unit which is being organised into mass treatment teams is proving very useful. Its main function is to combat major endemic diseases such as yaws and trypanosomiasis and epidemic diseases such as cerebro-spinal meningitis and small-pox wherever possible. There are three mobile dispensaries under the charge of Government-trained nurses based on Winneba, Sunyani and Tamale respectively. These dispensaries which are an experiment are proving rather costly owing to the bad roads over which they travel and the frequent breakdowns resulting therefrom.

**Health**

In the rural areas particular attention is being paid by the Public Health authorities to village layouts, the protection of water supplies and the disposal of refuse.

**Labour**

An employment exchange has now been opened in Tamale, in addition to those at Accra, Kumasi, and Takoradi.

The senior staff of the Labour Department has been increased.

On the 1st April, 1951, there were 73 registered trade unions whose total paid-up membership was 23,726. This compares with 64 unions and 17,985 members on the 1st April, 1950.

**Rural Water Development**

To the end of April, 1951, 1,210 wells, 10 reservoirs, and 10 bore-holes had been completed in rural areas and in addition major piped supplies to seven towns were completed or in hand.

**Communications**

**Roads**

The mileage of all-weather roads maintained by the Public Works Department is now 3,685 miles, and that of roads maintained by the Political Administration, 2,928.

**Railways**

The gross earnings of the Railway and Takoradi and Accra Harbour Administration for the year 1950-51 were £3,262,611.

**Air**

The Gold Coast is connected with the United Kingdom by British Overseas Airways Corporation, with the United States of America and South Africa by Pan-American World Airways and with France, Portugal and Spain by airlines of the respective countries. West African Airways Corporation, besides operating an internal service, operate a coastal service to Dakar, where connection can be made with South America by B.O.A.C. and other international airlines. A W.A.A.C. service also operates to the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

Accra Airport, situated four-and-a-half miles north-east of Accra, is the Gold Coast international airport and is the terminus of the B.O.A.C. London-British West Africa service. It also handles P.A.W.A. aircraft operating between New York and Johannesburg, Air France aircraft operating between Dakar and Brazzaville, Transportes Aereos Portugueses aircraft operating between Lisbon and Lourenço Marques and, occasionally, Aviacion y Comercio aircraft operating between Madrid and Fernando Po or Bata.

There are three other aerodromes—at Takoradi, Kumasi and Tamale—and internal services to them by W.A.A.C. from Accra connect the western Gold Coast, Ashanti and the Northern Territories to the capital.

The four aerodromes have all-weather tarmac runways.

**Posts and Telegraphs**

There is now also a direct air parcel post service between the United Kingdom and the Gold Coast.

There are aeronautical radio-telecommunication stations with radio-beacons at Accra, Takoradi, Kumasi, and Tamale, with VHF and HF cathode-ray direction-finders at Tamale.
