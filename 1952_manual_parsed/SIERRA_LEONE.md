SIERRA LEONE

See pages 347–356 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

POPULATION

At the end of 1950 the population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at 1,975,000.

CONSTITUTION

On 7th April, 1951, new Letters Patent issued, to take effect on a date to be notified by proclamation of the Governor, revoking the Letters Patent of 1924. These differ from the earlier Letters Patent principally in that they no longer provide for a Legislative Council and for legislative procedure. The Letters Patent took effect from the 27th November, 1951. New Royal Instructions dated 9th April, 1951, revoke the Instructions of 1924. These provide for an Executive Council of four ex officio members and not less than four unofficial members appointed from among the elected members of the Legislative Council. The Instructions also deal with legislative procedure. On 9th April, 1951, there issued new Orders of the King in Council, one to provide for the Protectorate, the other to provide for the Legislative Council, each revoking the corresponding Orders in Council of 1924. The former Instrument does not differ substantially from the Order in Council of 1924, but the latter provides for a new Legislative Council, to consist of 32 members including the Governor (who is President) and a Vice-President. There are seven ex officio members, seven members elected from the Colony districts, twelve members elected from the Protectorate District Councils, two members elected from the Protectorate Assembly, and two nominated members appointed by the Governor. This Order in Council contains provisions in connection with legislative procedure which in 1924 were included in the Letters Patent. It does not, however, contain the procedure for the election of members to the Legislative Council, as did the Order in Council of 1924. This is now provided for in a local Statute, the Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance, 1951.

ADMINISTRATION

Protectorate

In 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities are vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the economic development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations, Government and from the Produce Marketing Board.
