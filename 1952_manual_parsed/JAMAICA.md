JAMAICA

See pages 187–206 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

HURRICANE DAMAGE AND RECONSTRUCTION

Jamaica was struck by a hurricane on the night of the 17th August, 1951. 157 lives were lost. The most serious damage was in the South-East part of the Island but damage to agriculture was widespread. Banana trees throughout the Island were blown down. The Governor opened a Hurricane Relief Fund to which His Late Majesty King George VI and other members of the Royal Family made contributions. Amongst donations from many parts of the world was a gift of £250,000 from the U.K. Government. Towards the cost of reconstructing the Island's productive capacity, the U.K. Government agreed to make available up to £4,600,000 (up to £3,100,000 as a grant and up to £1,500,000 as a loan).

COMMUNICATIONS

Air

A total of 6,680 flights were made in 1950 through the Palisadoes Airport.

The Montego Bay Airport was opened to internal traffic and limited international services throughout the year. There were 1,064 flights.

Grand Cayman: Alighting areas for flying boat operation were maintained at Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac; the latter, however, can only be used when the prevailing wind is from the south.

Turks Island: The small landing strip was used by light commercial and private aircraft operating occasional services between the Island and the Dominican Republic.

South Caicos: The landing strip was available to all aircraft on request or for purposes of emergency, and was used on several occasions.

The Kingston Oceanic Air Traffic Control Centre and the 7th Regional Notam Centre, which were established at Palisadoes in April, 1948 (on which date International Civil Aviation Organisation procedures were implemented in the Caribbean), provided air traffic control services to all aircraft within or passing through the area.

The Centre, in 1950, controlled 15,494 flights, which was an increase of 1,804 flights over the year 1949.

On the 1st October, 1950, the boundaries of the control area were extended, thus increasing considerably the area controlled by Kingston.

During 1950, all International Civil Aviation Organisation requirements were fulfilled by the Centre and the Tower. The Tower handled 13,214 operations in that year.

The Government Aeronautical Radio Station (MRX), which provided air-to-ground, point-to-point and meteorological communication services, was handed over to Messrs. International Aeradio (Caribbean) Limited on the 1st of July, 1950, and has been operated by that Company for and on behalf of Government since that date.

PUBLIC FINANCE

(See Note on page 27.)

At the end of the financial year 1949-50, the public debt stood at £14,001,129 representing approximately £9 17s. per head of population, and the estimated value of the sinking funds accumulated towards the redemption of this debt was £2,304,797. The net debt was therefore approximately £11,696,332.

The main sources of revenue are customs and excise duties and internal revenue. The total revenue from customs duties in 1949-50 was £3,405,316 of which £3,309,554 was the yield from import duties. Of the £1,959,525 paid in excise duty in 1949-50, £700,684 was in respect of the duty on rum and £948,625 on tobacco. Internal revenue in 1949-50 included £2,001,832 from income tax and surtax, £31,929 from excess profits tax, £438,903 from postal charges and £120,135 from licences.

The Revenue and Expenditure for the financial year 1950-51 were £10,356,594 and £10,491,757 respectively.

Grants and loans under Colonial Development and Welfare Acts amounted to £1,800.

PRODUCTION AND TRADE

The value of the total trade of Jamaica showed a slight upward trend in 1950. Food, drink and tobacco accounted for £5,375,156 as against £4,807,125 in 1949.

The total value of commodity trade (imports and exports) for the year 1950 amounted to £37,487,023 of which imports accounted for £22,379,233, domestic exports, £14,662,696 and foreign exports, £445,094.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Plans for the reorganisation of the solar evaporated salt industry have been mooted at various times for the last century, but from 1946 onwards great efforts have been made to find a solution to the difficulties of a small industry which is compelled to sell its products on a highly competitive world market, which had over fifty owners all with rival theories of what should be done and which was crippled by lack of capital.

On April 9th, 1951, the Turks Islands Salt Company Limited took over the industry, the owners of salinas and ancillary equipment and property voluntarily accepting £100,000 (including a schedule of Government equipment and property valued at £6,000) as compensation. Approximately one-third of the compensation was in cash and two-thirds in redeemable preference shares in the new Company. The new capital was made available from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds and a further sum of £60,000 is being loaned to the Company by the Colonial Development Corporation. The Government of the Dependency holds all the Ordinary shares in the Company and has a majority holding of the entire share capital and a majority on the Board of Directors. This variation of the principle of public ownership provides for a partnership of Public funds and Private capital and gives the Dependency the opportunity to acquire its major industry outright over a period of thirty years.

The strong Welfare aspect of this scheme is balanced by the necessity for sound commercial management because of the highly competitive nature of the salt business. The tasks of reorganisation and of speeding up lighterage and loading arrangements are now being tackled.

COMMUNICATIONS

Air

The small landing strip at Turks Island was used by light commercial and private aircraft operating occasional services between the Island and the Dominican Republic.

The landing strip at South Caicos was available to all aircraft on request or for purposes of emergency, and was used on several occasions.

were received during the year, £6,240 were received as grants and loans under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

**Currency and Banking**

The currency used is Jamaican bank notes, British silver and Jamaican subsidiary coinage.

On the 31st December, 1950, the Government Savings Bank had 1,515 depositors, deposits totalling £65,741.

**Trade**

(See Note on page 27.)

In 1950 total imports amounted to £101,630 of which £11,954 represented the value of imports from the United Kingdom, £45,372 from other British countries, £ nil from the U.S.A., and £44,304 from other countries. Exports for 1950 were valued at £35,296. No exports were despatched to the United Kingdom or to the U.S.A.
