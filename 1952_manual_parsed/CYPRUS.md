CYPRUS

See pages 110–122 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

SITUATION AND AREA

The island of Cyprus is situated 41 miles from Asia Minor to the north and 60 miles from Syria to the east (there is an error in the first sentence under this heading in The Colonial Office List 1951).

ADMINISTRATION

The word “seven” should be added before the word “magistrates” in the 10th line of subparagraph (3) under this heading in The Colonial Office List 1951.

In addition to the fact that the Turkish Family Law is expressly saved, the old Sher’i Courts which administered the Sher’iat (or Kuranic Law) were, on the recommendation of the Turkish Affairs Committee and as a result of the Turkish Family Courts Law, 1951, replaced by the Turkish Family Courts. Instead of being presided over
by the Sher'ie Hakimi (or Kadi) the new Courts have, as Presidents, Turkish Family Court Judges, the old office of Kadi being abrogated. These Courts have jurisdiction over persons of the Moslem faith in matters concerning betrothal, marriage, divorce (and matters pertaining thereto), maintenance, registration of Vakfiefs (Moslem Charitable, or otherwise inalienable grants, or trusts) and administration of Infants' Estates. Appeals lie in the usual way to the Supreme Court. The Sher'i Laws previously in force were repealed by the Turkish Family (Marriage and Divorce) Law, 1951.
