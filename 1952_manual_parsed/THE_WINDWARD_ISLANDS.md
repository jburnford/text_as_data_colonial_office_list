THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

See pages 419-434 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

CONSTITUTION

Each of the four colonies of Grenada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia and Dominica retains its own institutions. The Governor is normally resident in Grenada where he is assisted by a Chief Secretary of the Windward Islands. The government of each colony is administered by a resident Administrator subject to instructions from the Governor. There is no common Legislature, nor common laws, revenue or tariff. Each colony has a Legislative Council presided over by the Administrator, in which the majority of members are elected by universal adult suffrage; and each colony has an Executive Council which may be summoned and consulted by either the Governor or the Administrator. A Court of Appeal for the West Indies consisting of the chief justices of the several West Indies Islands except Jamaica was set up in 1920 by Imperial Act (9 and 10 Geo. V. c. 47) and a Supreme Court and Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands and Leeward Islands were established by the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands (Courts) Order-in-Council 1939. There is also a common audit system, instituted in 1889.

COMMUNICATIONS

The temporary service with Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft is now operated by British Guiana Airways between St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Dominica (and not between Grenada, St. Vincent and Dominica).

REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

(See Note on page 27.)

In 1949 the combined Revenue amounted to $8,692,588 and the combined Expenditure to $9,349,489. The provisional figures for 1950 are $10,398,816 and $10,141,578 respectively.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The currency comprises dollar notes ($1 = 4/2d.) and British coinage. Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board were introduced in 1951 when the Windward Islands joined with the other British territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands and Trinidad) in currency unification. Trinidad Government notes continue as legal tender but are being withdrawn and the Banks' powers of note issue have been terminated. Legislative provision has been made for eventual unification of coin in the Eastern Caribbean including the Windwards.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada have branches in the larger islands.

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS

(See Note on page 27.)
