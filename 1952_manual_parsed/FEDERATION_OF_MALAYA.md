FEDERATION OF MALAYA

See pages 234–255 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

(These notes were prepared by the Federal Government in mid-1951 and consequently do not refer to Sir Henry Gurney’s death and to the recent developments. It is intended to include in the 1953 edition a more comprehensive review than has been possible in this first restricted edition.

Further information may be obtained from the Annual Report on the Federation of Malaya 1951 which will be published by the Government Press, Kuala Lumpur and, subsequently, by H.M. Stationery Office, London. The Annual Report for 1950 is at present obtainable from H.M. Stationery Office.)

SOCIAL SERVICES

Health

During 1950, 3,892,000 patients were treated either as out-patients or in-patients in the fixed and travelling dispensaries and welfare clinics in the rural areas.

Labour

No serious strikes occurred during the period under review, and although there were a number of industrial disputes and some protracted negotiations, industrial peace was generally maintained. This is significant when viewed against its proper background, as many wage adjustments took place as the selling price of tin and rubber increased to no small degree during this period. Unfortunately the cost of living has steadily risen so that the improvement in real wages has not been as substantial as a cursory glance at wage increases would indicate.

There was, during 1950, a distinct movement of labour away from the larger plantations to the smaller holdings, where very high wages (but few amenities) obtained, owing to the operation of various sharing systems and as a direct result of slack supervision caused by the absence of many managers and owners. However, towards the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951, this movement slackened as the smallholdings approached saturation point and as workers began also to appreciate the value of amenities and the better chance of security on the larger plantations.

A total of 37,067 man-days were lost during 1950, compared with 5,3901 man-days in 1949. The increase in 1950 was mainly due to demands for wage increases and to differences over the interpretation of certain wage-rate directives in the rubber industry. Mine workers were, on the whole, satisfied with a bonus scheme which increased their earnings as the price of tin improved. After two agreed wage increases had been given in the rubber industry during 1950, further negotiations failed, and the parties decided to go to arbitration. A Board of Arbitration was convened in January, 1951.

The figures for the production of tin and rubber during 1950 and the early part of 1951 are in themselves a remarkable tribute to the employers and workers in the Federation, who have been living under the dangerous and insecure conditions of a serious emergency. The “Briggs” plan for regrouping of labour forces has meant that many thousands of workers have had to move their homes and this has thrown a tremendous strain on them and also on their employers. The steadiness and industry of the established labour forces in the larger places of employment have been of inestimable value to the Malayan economy.

Welfare

The technical services of the Department of Social Welfare have been strengthened. Juvenile Courts and an effective Probation Service are in being throughout the Federation of Malaya.
As from 1st January, 1951, the functions under the heading of "General Welfare" became the responsibility of the State and Settlement Governments. Social Welfare Officers and their staffs concerned with those functions are now an integral part of the State and Settlement Establishments.

The departmental training schemes have been continued and extended with success. The training course for Malayan Probation Officers held in Malacca in 1950 enabled the setting up of the Juvenile Courts and Probation Services.

The Central Welfare Council and the State and Settlement Welfare Committees, now independent bodies, together with other voluntary organisations, are taking an increasing part in personal social service and in dealing with special problems as in the campaign against tuberculosis and the building up of blind welfare services. A Malayan Youth Council has been set up. Youth Services have expanded. There has been an increase in the number of rural community centres and village halls.

**Information Services**

Since the war, a Department of Information has been established. The fundamental purpose of the Information machinery of Government may be defined as being to provide a sustained and intensive effort, with a planned strategy, to raise the level of public understanding and to inculcate in the people interest in, and knowledge of, their political, social and economic responsibilities.

In 1951 community radios were installed in some 744 Malayan villages.

The Malayan Film Unit has been permanently established and its locally-trained staff are now producing work of considerable value.

**Communications**

**Roads**

During 1950, 467 miles of road were re-metalled, hard surface or bitumen sealed and the programme of gradual replacement of old and unserviceable bridges and culverts was continued.

The expenditure in 1950 on the maintenance of the 5,373 miles of metalled roads in the Federation amounted to $17,679,000, giving an average cost of $3,290 per mile.

The total number and tonnage of ships that entered and cleared the Ports of Penang, Port Swettenham and Malacca during 1950 was as follows:

Total: 24,538 ships, 626,781 tons
