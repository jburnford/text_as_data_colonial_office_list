**KENYA**

See pages 207–222 of *The Colonial Office List 1951*.

**Situation and Area**

The area of the Highlands comprising about 16,000 square miles is included in the total of 224,960 square miles given in the table under this heading in *The Colonial Office List 1951*. The other figures in the table should be regarded as approximate only.

**Religion**

The total African Christian community is estimated to be of the order of 800,000 (not 300,000 as stated in *The Colonial Office List 1951*).

**Administration**

In the list of districts of the Coast Province given in *The Colonial Office List 1951* "Giriama" should now be read instead of "Kilifi".

"Mandera" should be added to the list of districts of the Northern Province.

**Post-War Reorganisation**

The full title of the Chief Secretary is now "Chief Secretary and Member for Development". Other revised titles are:—The Deputy Chief Secretary and Member for Education and Labour, The Member for Agriculture and Natural Resources, and The Member for Health, Lands and Local Government. The Member for Commerce and Industry now sits on the Executive and Legislative Councils as an *ex officio* member.

Sir Reginald Edwin Robins is no longer a member of the Authority for Development and Reconstruction. The members now are Sir Godfrey Rhodes, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O., M.L.C., Major A. G. Keyser, D.S.O., M.L.C. and Sir Alfred Vincent, M.C.A., in addition, of course, to the Chief Secretary and Member for Development as Chairman.

The Planning Committee set up in 1948 to revise the Development Programme, was reconstituted as a Standing Planning Committee in March, 1950, with the Chief Secretary as Chairman, two other official and four unofficial Members. This Committee submitted an interim report in November, 1950, and it presented in June, 1951, a comprehensive report recommending the lines of development for the remainder of the ten-year period.

**Social Services**

**Information Services**

The African Information Services, set up at the beginning of 1951, are charged with the task of providing a centralized service for the production and employment of information material in all media designed to assist the Press Officer, District Teams and the departments of Government, so as to advance the social and economic welfare of the African peoples.

The following are the main services provided by the office:

**Press Office**

The Press Office was established in the Secretariat on June 1st, 1951. All official hand-outs and communiques are issued to the European, Asian...
and African Press through this office, and particular attention is now being paid towards improving the standard of the African vernacular press.

Articles on the work of Government Departments and matters of general interest are prepared for local press use and for overseas, and distribution is made through the office to the local press of material prepared by the Colonial Office and the Central Office of Information.

A summary of opinion on African affairs as expressed in the local press is prepared fortnightly and distributed for information only on a limited distribution list to those interested in African Affairs.

This office also prepares and issues the K.I.O. Fortnightly, a publication of particular interest to farmers.

Every assistance is rendered to overseas journalists visiting Kenya as well as to the press throughout the world when information on the Colony is required.

Publications

"Pamoja", a Swahili broadsheet for Africans containing an editorial on local or world affairs, is published weekly and 18,500 copies distributed.

Funds and material are supplied for 14 district news sheets in local vernaculars and in some cases these are edited in the office.

Books, pamphlets, leaflets and posters are prepared as required to support specific publicity campaigns.

Broadcasting

Broadcasts to Africans are given daily from a studio in the office and transmitted throughout Kenya by Messrs. Cable and Wireless, Ltd. Special broadcasts such as running commentaries on the more important football matches and athletic meetings are given periodically as well as regular quiz competitions, radio plays and other features.

Three local broadcasts in Swahili are given each week from a studio in Mombasa. Funds for this service and material for the broadcasts are provided by the office.

The office owns and maintains some hundred wireless sets which are distributed to community centres, information rooms, district headquarters, missions, schools, etc., for communal listening to its programmes by Africans.

Still Photographs

A Photographic Section is maintained to provide pictures needed for the illustration of the Services' publications and to prepare filmstrips for Africans.

All photographs in a library of some 12,000 prints are available to the general public, visiting journalists, etc.

Prints are supplied to Government Departments for displays at Agricultural Shows and other exhibitions and to community centres for wall display.

The office owns and maintains some 90 filmstrip projectors which are placed in community centres throughout the Colony. In addition to locally produced filmstrips these are supplied with strips obtained from the United Kingdom.

Cine Films

A Production Unit makes 16mm. educational and comic films and newsreels for Africans.

A central film library is maintained consisting of locally produced films together with those supplied by the Central Office of Information and the Colonial Film Unit and some purchased from commercial sources.

In addition to the mobile information units this library supplies some 105 projection posts showing to Africans throughout the Colony.

35mm. copies of "British News" received from the Central Office of Information are supplied to commercial cinemas.

Mobile Information Units

Seven Mobile Information Units are attached to Provincial Commissioners' offices in the four main provinces. They are constantly on safari, working under the direction of the Provincial Administration, and give cinema shows in the evenings, and lectures supported by filmstrip shows during the daytime. The majority of the shows are for Africans but European and Asian schools also receive visits from time to time.

Despatch and Distribution

In addition to its own publications the office distributes some 10,000 copies of each issue of the Colonial Office publication in Swahili and English, "Siku Hizi", free to individual Africans, community centres, schools, information rooms, district headquarters, missions and employers of large labour forces. Posters, booklets, etc., received from the Colonial Office and the Central Office of Information are also distributed to various lists of addressees in the Colony, selected according to the type of material.

The average weekly output amounts to some 35,000 items.

Translation Work

The office undertakes translation work for other Government departments in five local vernaculars.

Health

Local Native Councils are now known as African District Councils.

Welfare

The Social Welfare Organisation has been re-named The Community Development Organisation. It is still, however, a branch of the African Affairs Group. It has its Headquarters at Jeanes School, Kabete, where the Central Composite Training Centre is also situated.

The Commissioner for Social Welfare has been re-designated the Commissioner for Community Development. He is directly responsible to the Chief Native Commissioner for the policy with regard to Community Development including African Information Services and the Jeanes School.

In general the word "Welfare", previously occurring in the designation of officials dealing with community development, has been replaced by the words "Community Development"—e.g. African Welfare Workers are now known as Community Development Assistants.

Remedial welfare work is now organised separately.
COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

The Colony's road system consists of approximately 17,000 miles of road maintained as follows:

- 4,680 by Public Works Department.
- 2,628 by European District Councils.
- 272 by Municipal Councils.
- 481 by Royal National Parks Trustees.
- 477 by Forestry Department.
- 8,500 by African District Councils and the Administration.

237 miles of the P.W.D. roads system are bitumen surfaced.

The great North road passes through Kenya, entering the Colony from Tanganyika and the South at Namanga and passing through Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu to cross the border into Uganda at Busia. The Nairobi-Nakuru section of this road (approximately 100 miles in length) is bitumenised and work is at present in progress on bitumenising the seventeen miles between Nairobi and Athi River. Sixteen miles of bitumen road to the west of Nakuru are practically finished and work has started on the construction of the road westward towards Londiani.

Work has also started on the construction of a road on a new alignment leading northward from Thika to Sagana.

The recently realigned Nairobi-Kiambu road is scheduled for bitumen surfacing this year (1951).

Work on the realignment of the road from Mombasa to Mackinnon Road (55 miles) continues and construction of the bridges carrying the new road over the Maji-ya-Chumvi river and railway line is in progress. Apart from eight miles of bitumen surface near Mackinnon Road, the new road will not be bitumenised for the present.

Shipping

The shipping services listed under this heading in The Colonial Office List 1951 have been subject to some modification and certain new services have been instituted.

FINANCE

(See Note on page 27.)

In 1950, the Revenue amounted to £13,244,019 and the Expenditure to £12,503,798. The Public Debt totalled £13,710,600.

In 1949, Revenue amounted to £13,030,651 and Expenditure to £10,761,676. The Public Debt totalled £14,010,600.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. now maintains an Agency at Molo as well as at Thika. Barclays Bank (D., C. & O.) maintains an Agency at Thika as well as at Kilindini.

LAND AND PRODUCTS

The export of agricultural and animal produce reached a total value of £9,635,894 in 1949.

Fishing is carried on off the sea-coast of Kenya, and in Lake Victoria, Lake Rudolf and other smaller lakes and rivers. Adequate supplies for consumption in the Colony are available. The main difficulties are distribution and retailing facilities. Fishery organisation is going ahead.

TRADE AND CUSTOMS

(See Note on page 27.)

In 1949 the Customs Departments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika were amalgamated under the title of the East African Customs and Excise Departments as an East Africa High Commission Service with Headquarters in Mombasa and Regional Offices in Mombasa, Kampala and Dar-es-Salaam.

Identical customs tariffs were enacted in Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika in 1923 and revised in 1930. Surcharges were introduced during the recent war and in 1946 these were incorporated in the Kenya Tariff. In 1948, however, the equivalent of the war-time surcharges were removed from the import duties on certain foodstuffs, apparel, cotton piece goods, bicycles and parts and motor cars and parts.

Subsequent amendments to the tariff have been made with the intention of adjusting anomalies assisting reconstruction by removal of duties on certain builder's materials, and attempting to offset the high and rising cost of essential consumer goods such as shirts, underwear, paraffin, khaki drill and blankets by the removal or reduction of duties on these goods. The last mentioned alterations were made in 1950 by Kenya and Uganda, but similar alterations were not made in Tanganyika, and the tariffs of the three East African territories, while possessing a main common structure, now differ in minor respects.

The basic fiscal rate is 22 per cent. ad valorem assessed on the value which is taken as being the price which the goods would fetch on sale in the open market in the Colony if delivered at the point of importation, freight, insurance and all costs charges and expenses having been paid by the seller. Specific duties are charged on goods which lend themselves to such a form of assessment, the more important of such goods being potable spirits, cigarettes and tobacco, motor spirits, tyres and tubes, matches and cement. In the case of certain articles such as piece goods, wearing apparel and cycles, minimum specific duties have been fixed as an alternative to an ad valorem rate in order to safeguard the revenue against abnormally cheap supplies.

The free list includes the chief development imports such as machinery; road, rail, air and water transport equipment; coal, coke and fuel oil; packing materials; explosives; insecticides and agricultural and mining equipment; and builders' requisites and sanitaryware. Exemption from duty is also allowed in the case of drugs, medicines and disinfectants; shirts, vests, socks, stockings, pullovers, cardigans, jumpers; paraffin; filters and refrigerators, surgical and scientific instruments; educational requisites; religious articles; music and literature and bona fide baggage brought by passengers for personal and household use.

Provision is made in the tariff for the imposition of what are known as "suspended" duties on certain commodities which are produced and manufactured in one or more of the territories—Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. These duties may be imposed, varied or revoked unilaterally thus allowing a modified control by each territory over the degree of protection afforded to a number of the local products.

By a tripartite Customs Agreement in 1927, a system of inter-territorial transfers of imported goods was introduced between Kenya, Uganda...
