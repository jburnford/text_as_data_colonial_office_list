**Industry, Trade and Customs**

(See Note on page 27.)

The Government flax mill is leased to a local company. There are now seven other mills operating in the island, the amount of fibre and tow exported in 1950 being 1,200 and 643 tons respectively. The amount of rope and twine exported during the same year was 36 tons.

The export of lily bulbs to England has suffered a decline owing to the prevalence of disease, but it is hoped to revive it again to the benefit of the Colony, particularly to small growers.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown for supplies, including steamers and ships of war, was 27 in 1950. The tonnage of shipping entered and cleared during the year was 179,302, of which British tonnage amounted to 178,239.

**POPULATION**

The revenue and expenditure of the Poor Relief Board for the year 1950 was £1,736 and £1,881 respectively.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

The Union Castle Mail Steamship Company’s vessels call at the Island approximately twice a month—once in each direction on their “round Africa” service. Intervals between arrivals and departures of mails are variable.

TRISTAN DA CUNHA

In 1950, the islanders numbered 240, and there were 26 resident non-islanders. There were about 260 head of cattle on the island.

Except during the war years it had become the practice to arrange, if possible, for a ship to call annually at the Island with mails and supplies. With the establishment of the fishing industry in 1949, five or six calls a year during the summer months have, however, become the rule.

In 1950 an Island Council, which had been in informal existence for some 25 years, was reorganised on the basis of three non-islander members (including the Administrator as Chairman) and 17 Islander members (including six women representatives).

December to March is the period of the year that the weather is most likely to be settled and suitable for visiting and landing upon the Island. But in all seasons, except the mid-winter of June, July and August, weather conditions quite often permit the islanders to voyage in open canvas boats to Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands to gather birds and eggs, shear the sheep kept on Inaccessible, etc.

For flour, sugar, jam, and other prepared or manufactured food the Island is dependent upon imports. Apple trees are in fair number and bear well; there are also peaches, vines, a few fig trees and a plentiful supply of local "cranberry." The main tree of the island, *Phylla nitida*, which resembles a juniper and upon which the islanders still largely depend for fuel, has been cut out in the immediate vicinity of the settlement, but still covers at least 20% of the Island. Attempts are now being made to establish this, Insignis Pine, and other suitable species, on a plantation basis.

The meteorological and wireless station which is still maintained on the Island by the Government of South Africa is in contact with passing shipping daily from 12.00 to 13.00 hours G.M.T., for the purpose of giving and receiving weather reports on a frequency of 500 Kc/s.

Fish of good quality is plentiful. There are rich crayfish beds, and some 60 tons of tails were exported in 1950. The canning factory of the Tristan Development Company, the South African company referred to in *The Colonial Office List 1951*, was completed at the end of 1950.
