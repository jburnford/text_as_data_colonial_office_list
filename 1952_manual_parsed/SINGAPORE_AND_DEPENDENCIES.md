SINGAPORE AND DEPENDENCIES

See pages 356–370 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

HISTORY

The grant by Royal Charter of City Status to Singapore Municipality on the 22nd September, 1951 was a land-mark in the history of the Colony.

CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION

Form of Government

The Executive Council over which the Governor presides consists of the 4 ex-officio members of the Legislative Council (see below), two other officials, and 6 unofficials including 2 elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council now consists of the Governor as President (with an original and a casting vote); 4 ex-officio members (the Colonial and Financial Secretaries, the Attorney-General, and the President of the City Councillors); 5 nominated officials; 3 elected severally by the Singapore, Chinese and Indian Chambers of Commerce; 9 elected by universal suffrage of all British subjects and persons born in the British protected States in Malaya and Borneo over 21 on the annually-revised electoral register; and 4 nominated unofficials. The Council thus has an unofficial majority. The nine elected members are returned from single-member constituencies. Those on the electoral register now number 46,622. The Council has an unofficial Vice-President who deputises for the President.

The City Council of Singapore consists of a President and 27 members.

Eighteen of the City Councillors are elected by popular vote, six elections being held each year. The City Electoral Register now includes 26,898 names.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

The enrolment in all registered schools is now 139,956 as compared with 124,113 a year ago. Of the number of pupils now in English schools, 16,773 receive remission of fees, while 17,025 pupils in other registered schools received assistance in paying school fees.

Expenditure in 1951 on education, excluding expenditure on public works, is estimated at $16,303,943. The actual figure in 1950 was $8,879,381.

The eighteen new schools in the 1950 Supplementary Education Plan were all completed, and are functioning, nine of them having both morning and afternoon sessions. One of the 1950 Supplementary schools has been completed and six others are under construction. Three schools scheduled under the Ten-Year Plan have been completed, one is under construction, and tenders for two others have been accepted. Extensions to two older English schools are under way. One new Malay school has been completed.

There are 1,480 teachers and students undergoing training at Government expense. 129 of these are enrolled in full-time courses at the Teachers' Training College, and 983 in part-time courses, the medium of instruction being English. There are twenty-one Singapore Malay students at the Sultan Idris Training College, and seven at the Malay Women's Training College. The remainder consist of teachers enrolled in training classes conducted in Chinese, Malay, and English. 1,305 students attend adult classes in technical subjects in the evenings.

The Government is now bearing the total expense of the teaching of English in Chinese schools. In addition, the grant-in-aid for all aided Chinese schools (containing sixty per cent of the total enrolment) has been doubled. A liaison officer has been appointed to make and preserve contact with Managing Committees, and schools are being encouraged to have their constitutions drawn up and submitted for approval.

Pressure on space in Malay schools continues to increase. The most important development has been a suggestion from the teachers, supported
by a large section of the parents, that the curriculum of these schools should be altered in such a way as to dovetail into the "Regional" school scheme.

The Council for Adult Education, reference to which was made last year, is now firmly established. The Government voted it a sum of $173,000 for 1951; the Council has reached the target it set itself for 1951, and is proposing to double its work in 1952. There are four tutorial classes running, and in the literacy campaign there are 75 classes in English, 73 in Mandarin, 2 in Malay and 1 in Tamil. The Council is giving urgent attention to the provision of suitable headquarters. Its work, limited at present, is commended to every church, firm, trade union, social club and welfare organisation.

The Schools Broadcasts from Radio Malaya have further consolidated their position as an essential part of the educational system. The programmes are prepared and broadcast in Singapore but they serve the whole of the Federation in addition to the Colony. During 1951 the Malay and Chinese broadcasts particularly have shown development.

Department of Broadcasting

By the 31st August, 1951, 29,514 wireless licences had been issued in Singapore.

Broadcasts to schools now occupy 20½ hours per week, 9 in English, 7½ in Chinese, and 3½ in Malay.

Health

The Government Medical Department, in its 9 hospitals, now provide accommodation of up to 4,000 beds including the Mental Hospital.

There are now five static dispensaries and four travelling dispensaries for the rural population.

The Medical Plan which was approved in 1948, seeks to double the present services in all directions.

By the end of 1951, the new Medical Store and Manufactory will be completed and a further extension of accommodation will be provided at Trafalgar House (Hospital for Lepers). 1952 will see the beginning of a new Outpatients' Department and Nurses Hostel to accommodate 250 nurses at the General Hospital.

500 beds are provided at the T.B. clinic presented by the Rotary Club.

With the assistance of a World Health Organisation team of experts a B.C.G. campaign was successfully started in 1951 and this work is now being built up as a routine part of the medical department's work. If the average incidence of tuberculosis from 1939-1941 is taken as 100, the index which rose to 170 during the Japanese occupation fell to 52 in 1950. The problem remains urgent and plans for a sanatorium are now being made.

The Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association is also greatly extending its accommodation.

Hospital out-patient attendances which were under 100,000 in pre-war years rose to 433,000 in 1950. Tuberculosis out-patients increased from a negligible number before the war to 43,000 in 1950. In the rural and maternity services, clinics have increased in number from 11 before the war to 39 in 1950; attendances have increased in the same period from 85,000 to 170,000. Homes visited by nurses now total 28,000 and by midwives 47,000. In the villages, midwives are attending 4-5 times as many deliveries as are considered the maximum in the United Kingdom. Two new Infant Welfare Clinics are under construction.

The key problem remains one of staff and accommodation. Plans are, however, on foot for intensive recruiting of nurses after the provision of the new Nurses Hostel has been completed.

Although the population is increasing by some 30,000 a year the number of deaths dropped from 14,200 in 1939 to 12,300 in 1950 and infantile deaths from 4,500 to 3,800. The infant mortality rate has fallen from 130·47 in 1939, and about 300 during the occupation, to 82·2 in 1950.

Labour

The rise in the cost of living, which occurred shortly after the rise in rubber and tin prices to high levels early in 1951, brought a crop of negotiated agreements between workers and employers giving increases in wage rates or cost of living allowances. According to records kept by the Labour Department, there were negotiated increases in 23 different industries, and there is little doubt that there was a general rise in rates over the whole field of employment.

The declaration of the Emergency in June, 1948, led to the disappearance of many of the leaders of the communist-dominated trade unions. During the three years which have elapsed since then, the trade union movement has made useful progress, the idea of voluntary negotiation having gained much ground. There were three strikes in the early part of 1951, two of them lasting over three weeks each. While the right to strike has been in no way restricted as a result of the Emergency, under the Emergency (Strikes and Lock-outs) Regulations 1948, fourteen days notice of strike or lock-out must be given by workers or employers. A Trade Union Congress was formed in 1951. The total membership of Unions is about 53,000.

A tripartite delegation from Singapore attended the Asian Regional Conference of the I.L.O. in Ceylon in January, 1950.

The 1947 amendment to the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance bringing labourers earning up to $400 a month within its scope was extended into 1951. A new Workmen's Compensation Ordinance is under preparation.

Welfare

The Department of Social Welfare carries out statutory and administrative functions in the social field which are not provided by existing Government Departments. The Colony's numerous and well organised voluntary agencies, with whom the Department works in close partnership, cover an important segment of the welfare field. The Department operates such residual institutions or services as are not, or cannot conveniently be, established and maintained by voluntary effort alone.

The Department acts as a co-ordinating agency between the various voluntary bodies as well as those Departments of Government whose activities impinge upon the field of social welfare. The medium by which this is carried out is the Social Welfare Council, consisting of representatives of the most prominent voluntary bodies including the churches, as well as heads of the Departments of Education, Medicine and Labour,
and representatives of the City Council and the Rural Board. Government grants to voluntary bodies are administered by the Department.

The Department is the body which exercises statutory functions under the Women and Girls' Ordinance and the Children's Ordinance. In this it co-operates with the Police, the Immigration Department, and the Medical Department, carrying out raids on notorious premises, screening all female immigrants, conducting prosecutions and maintaining a large number of women and children in need of care and protection in three institutions as well as inspecting similar institutions run by voluntary bodies.

Indoor and outdoor assistance is financed partly from revenue and partly by trust funds and voluntary organisations. The Tuberculosis Treatment Allowances Scheme, introduced in 1949, is a primary weapon in the Colony's action against tuberculosis. Its aim is to rehabilitate tuberculosis victims in the early stages whilst cure is still possible. A new scheme for public assistance was brought into force on the 1st August, 1951, and this scheme as well as the Tuberculosis Treatment Allowances Scheme are under constant review and revision as experience is gained in their operation.

The Probationary Service has now been extended to the Adult Courts. Hitherto, the Probationary Service had worked only in conjunction with the Juvenile Court, which sits in the Social Welfare Department building. The Department is responsible for the management of institutions for the detention of juveniles, and is responsible for the administration of the legislation providing for the registration of transferred children. An advice and enquiry service is in existence helping individuals in such matters as making claims, settling disputes and tracing relatives.

The Department runs 18 Children's Social Centres, which are attended by some of the poorest children between the ages of 2 and 14. In the early days of these Centres, the emphasis lay largely on the feeding aspect, but more and more emphasis is now being put on the social and educational potentialities which the Centres have been shown to possess in over-crowded areas, where schooling, club and community facilities are not yet available to the whole population. These Centres owe their success largely to a body of voluntary workers, representative of all communities in Singapore.

The Department seeks to stimulate the establishment of boys' and girls' clubs and hostels and where possible to run such institutions through the agency of voluntary bodies, the Department providing funds and advice when required. In this work the Department collaborates with the Singapore Youth Council and the Federation of Boys' Clubs, both independent organisations.

The training of officers of the Department, both in Singapore and in the United Kingdom, has proceeded satisfactorily. Two senior officers of the Department, who have been studying in London for the last three years, are expected back before the end of 1951. A further two senior officers will proceed to the United Kingdom for specialised training during the course of 1952. Slowly, but surely, the Department is building up a body of professional officers specially trained in various aspects of Social Welfare work.

Through the Social Research Section of the Department, it is hoped to plan surveys which will be of great value in the future social and economic planning of Singapore.

COMMUNICATIONS

Shipping and Port Facilities

The total length of the wharves of the Singapore Harbour Board is now 13,000 feet. The area of storage warehouses has increased to 800,000 sq. feet.

The total capacity of the dockyard power station is now 6,500 kilowatts.

For the year ended 30th June, 1951, 2,873 vessels of a total registered tonnage of 8,144,343 tons were berthed at the wharves. This is the highest figure since the war. The amount of cargo dealt with in the same period was 2,608,915 tons inward and 2,338,357 outward. These figures include fuel, oil and coal. During the same period, 416 vessels were docked for repairs and painting.

In the second paragraph under this subheading on p. 363 of The Colonial Office List 1951 "range" should of course be read for "length" in relation to the salvage tug.

PUBLIC FINANCE

(See Note on page 27.)

Public Revenue for 1950 was $113,774,111 and Expenditure, $95,979,289, making a surplus for the year of $17,794,822. The revised estimate of Revenue for 1951 is $151,892,186 and of Expenditure, $121,558,517, making a surplus of $30,333,669.

The chief sources of revenue in the approved estimates of 1950 were as follows:

| Source                  | Amount       |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Income tax              | $26,631,851  |
| Liquors Tax             | $13,235,567  |
| Entertainment Duties    | $3,382,849   |
| Petroleum               | $10,295,559  |
| Tobacco Duties          | $25,226,299  |

Singapore is a free port and there are therefore no tariffs except from the duties on spirits, tobacco and petrol.

The chief items of expenditure in the 1950 estimates were as follows:

| Item                   | Amount       |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Public Debt            | $8,092,857   |
| Education              | $8,170,217   |
| Medical                | $8,275,562   |
| Police                 | $8,245,751   |
| Public Works           | $12,714,854  |
| Social Welfare         | $1,772,750   |

The Public Debt in 1950 amounted to $123,675,378.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

With regard to the list of banks operating in Singapore and forming the Malayan Exchange Banks Association under this heading in The Colonial Office List 1951, the words "Netherlands India Commercial Bank; Incorporated in Amsterdam, Holland" should be replaced by "Nationale Handelsbank N.V." "Chung Khiaw Bank Ltd." should be added to the list.

EXTERNAL TRADE

During 1950 Singapore maintained its position as the main commercial centre of South-East Asia and as the chief port of the Federation of
Malaya of whose total imports and exports passed through Singapore. The export trade of the Colony itself showed an increase in value of $135 per cent totalling $2,483 million, compared with $1,055 million in 1949. The value of imports was $2,125 million as against $1,305 million in 1949. No purely Singapore figures are available for the volume of trade but the following Pan-Malayan figures are significant. Taking 1938 as the base year, the index of volume of Pan-Malayan exports rose from 134 in 1949 to 175 while the index of volume of Pan-Malayan imports rose from 125 in 1949 to 170.

The following statistics apply to Pan-Malaya (and exclude Federation—Singapore trade).

| Year | From/to U.K. | From/to other British countries | From/to U.S.A. | From/to other countries | Total |
|------|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------|
| Imports | 505,835,803 | 714,303,020 | 89,045,433 | 1,581,948,896 | 2,891,133,152 |
| Exports | 546,872,931 | 775,944,745 | 1,048,150,243 | 1,586,636,435 | 3,957,604,354 |

N.B. The above figures exclude parcel post, ships stores and bullion, specie and currency notes.
