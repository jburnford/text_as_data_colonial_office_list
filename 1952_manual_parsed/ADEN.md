ADEN COLONY

See pages 58-62 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

The Aden College is under construction but the total cost (including provision for sports fields and ground lay-out) is now estimated to be Rs.26,22,000, a large increase over the original estimate. It has now been decided to sanction the additional expenditure on the scheme.

The Technical College opened with two classes in January, 1951.

The British Council no longer maintains Institutes for men and women in the Colony.

Labour and Welfare

The Labour and Welfare Department in Aden commenced in a small way in 1950, under the District Commissioner. In April, 1951, it became a separate department. The small staff of a Labour and Welfare Officer, an Assistant Welfare Officer, a Labour Inspector and one clerk, are busily engaged in trying to implement the Ordinances regulating labour, and in particular in endeavouring to create better labour relations. The Labour Officer is also Factory Inspector for the Colony.

Recently improved labour legislation includes the compulsory reporting of industrial accidents, and the introduction for the first time in Aden of the 48-hour week for manual workers.

A re-organised and active Labour Advisory Board has been created, with representatives of employers and non-employers. As there are no Trade Unions in Aden, selection of representatives for wage earners presents a problem.

In social welfare the main efforts have been directed towards the children. Probation for juvenile offenders who have homes in Aden has met with marked success. The juvenile offender from the Yemen or the Protectorate who has made his way alone into the Colony presents an intractable problem.

The first Play Centre for children under 12 was opened in May, 1951, and the first Boys' Clubs started early in that year. Both these latter two activities are organised by voluntary societies.

A Social Welfare Advisory Council has been established, which meets regularly.

A committee has investigated the problem of the blind and reported to Government its recommendations.

COMMUNICATIONS

Shipping

A pontoon is now available at the Port to facilitate landing of passengers from big passenger liners.

Air

The landing-ground, Air Traffic Control Centre and Air-Sea Rescue Services are managed by the Royal Air Force. Since 1st September, 1950, a Civil Enclave has been established and a terminal building which is under construction, is expected to be completed by the end of 1951. The parking apron is also being extended to meet increasing traffic.

There are no internal colony services. Aden Airways, a subsidiary of B.O.A.C., operates scheduled services to Cairo, Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Sharjah and intends to introduce a service to Karachi.

Services to the Aden Protectorate are:

(1) A weekly service to Mukeiras on the Audhali plateau, with frequent additional charter flights.

(2) A weekly service to Riyan and Qatn in the Hadhramaut.

(3) Charter flights to Beihan.

Other operators are:

Ethiopian Air Lines who have daily schedules connecting Addis Ababa and Aden via Dire-Dawa and Djibouti;

Air India International who operate Constellation aircraft on a weekly service between Bombay and Nairobi with stops at Karachi and Aden;

Misrair who have recently been granted traffic rights and operate with Vikings:

(1) One service a week from Cairo via Khartoum and Asmara, and

(2) One service via Djeddah and Asmara; and

Yemen Air Lines who make frequent non-scheduled flights between Taiz and Aden.

Approximately three hundred aircraft a month land at or take off from Khormaksar airport carrying an average of 1,600 passengers and 146,450 kgs. of freight.

Social Services

In the Western Aden Protectorate the Abdali and Fadhli States have their own departments of education.

Public Revenue and Expenditure

(See note on page 27.)

The following are the 1951–52 estimated figures of Revenue and Expenditure for some of the Western Aden Protectorate States:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Rs.     | Rs.         |
| Fadhli..| 5,82,000    | 5,74,000    |
| Lower Aulaqi | 59,000 | 58,000 |
| Lower Yafai | 2,32,000 | 2,10,000 |
| Dathina | 1,12,000 | 1,11,000 |
| Amiri | 65,000 | 61,000 |
| Shaib | 38,000 | 35,000 |

The following are the 1950–51 estimated figures of Revenue and Expenditure for some of the Eastern Aden Protectorate States:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Rs.     | Rs.         |
| Qu’aiti | 28,07,313   | 27,60,126   |
| Kathiri | 3,62,422    | 3,10,973    |
| Wahidi Sultanates of Balhaf and Bir Ali (including Sheikdoms of Irqa and Haura) | 1,19,838 | 1,11,465 |

The principal sources of revenue in the Eastern Aden Protectorate are customs, licences and excise duties. In the Qu’aiti State over three lakhs are spent on the Armed Constabulary and police, nearly two lakhs on medical and public health, and nearly three lakhs on education. The State has also spent large sums from reserves for agricultural improvement, irrigation, building and repairing of dams and deflectors, etc. The Kathiri State has also contributed substantially towards agricultural development.

The main source of revenue in the States of the Western Aden Protectorate is customs.

Currency and Banking

In the Western Aden Protectorate the Rupee was replaced by the East African Shilling, with effect from the 1st November, 1951. The Riyal (or Maria Theresa Dollar) is still used, its value fluctuating with the value of silver.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, up to 1944, the Maria Theresa Dollar was the currency used throughout the interior, but in that year the Rupee currency was finally adopted. The Rupee has been replaced by the East African Shilling with effect from the 1st November, 1951, but the Maria Theresa Dollars remain the normal form of currency among the Bedouins, and in the less developed areas.

There are no banking facilities in the Aden Protectorate.

Trade, Industry and Agriculture

The control of agriculture and the development of the irrigation potential of the Abyan area of the Western Aden Protectorate is in the hands of a Board consisting of two members from the Lower Yafai State, two members from the Fadhli State and three officers appointed by the Governor. It is anticipated that the 1950–51 season will yield a crop of 6,000 bales of cotton.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the main industries are agriculture, weaving, dyeing, fishing, dhow building, lime burning, and sheep and camel breeding. The staple crops are wheat, millet, dhurra, dukhn, museibli, some barley, tobacco,
simsim, lucerne and some dates. There are some large plantations of banana, papau, etc., to be found in the coastal areas. Honey is found in small quantities. A new fish canning factory worked on modern lines with trawlers and motor boats is now functioning.
