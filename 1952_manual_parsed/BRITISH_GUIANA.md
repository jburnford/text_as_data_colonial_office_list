See pages 88–101 of The Colonial Office List 1951.

CONSTITUTION

A Constitutional Commission, composed of Sir John Waddington, G.B.E., K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O. (Chairman), Professor V. T. Harlow, M.A., D.Litt. and Dr. Rita Hinden, Ph.D., was appointed by the Secretary of State in October, 1950. The main recommendations of its report, which was published on 19th October, 1951, as Colonial No. 280, were (i) universal adult suffrage (ii) an increased elected majority in the Legislature and (iii) ministerial responsibility for elected members. In a despatch published with the Report the Secretary of State accepted these proposals and also agreed in principle to a bicameral system for the Legislature. It is intended to introduce the new Constitution in 1953.

ADMINISTRATION

Local Government

The revenue of the Georgetown Town Council in 1950 was £316,222 and the expenditure, £276,390.

The revenue of New Amsterdam Town Council was £57,733 and the expenditure, £53,031.

The combined figures for revenue and expenditure of all local authorities in 1950 were £80,296 and £75,495, respectively.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

The total expenditure on administration and grants in respect of education in 1950 was £461,675.

Three exhibitions to the University College of the West Indies were awarded during 1950 in addition to the other scholarships and exhibitions indicated under this sub-heading in The Colonial Office List 1951.

Evening classes were held at the Carnegie Trade School for Women, for women and girls of all ages who could not attend the day school but wished to improve their knowledge of cookery, dress-making, children’s clothes, smocking and embroidery. These classes consisted of 12 sessions and 600 persons attended. The revenue of the Trade School in 1950 was £3,592 and the expenditure, £9,532.

Health

The accommodation at the Canje, Berbice, Mental Hospital has increased from 500 to 744 beds.

At present there are 94 registered practitioners in the Colony, of whom 45 are employed by Government (36 holding posts as G.M.O.s and 9 as administrative and specialist officers) and 40 registered dentists, including one full-time Government Dental Officer and two part-time Dental Officers. There are 534 Registered Nurses and 754 Registered Midwives.

Welfare

During 1950 investigations were conducted by the Cottage Industries Officer into a number of minor industries. The commercial production of a cereal confection from padi, “Padipops”, was commenced in July, 1950, and 25,000 packets worth $2,000 odd were produced and sold locally.

There is an old age pension of $4·50 per month for those over 65.

The Youth Council referred to under this sub-heading in The Colonial Office List 1951 is an affiliate of the World Assembly of Youth.

COMMUNICATIONS

Roads

A system of motor trails in the Rupununi District now connects the various airstrips with the Amerindian Settlements and ranchers’ homesteads. Approximately 400 miles of trails in this area have led to an increasing use of motor transportation where, previously, horse and bullock-cart were the only means of transport. A series of bridges in the system now makes it possible to travel by motor transport from Annai, the north terminus, to Ishalton, the south terminus, a distance of approximately 210 miles.

Air

The British Guiana Airways Limited operates a network of weekly services to all Interior areas. The Company’s fleet of Dakota (D.C.3) and Grumman Goose Amphibian aircraft is also available for charter flights internally to points in the Interior, or externally to the West Indies, Dutch and French Guiana, and the Federal Territory of the Rio Branco in North Brazil.

The Colony’s International Airport is at Atkinson Field, 25 miles south of Georgetown. There are also airstrips at Mackenzie, Demerara River, and Mahdia in the Potaro, and Annai, Lethern and Wichabai in the Rupununi. In addition a network of satellite landing strips and an artificial water alighting area at Baramita in the North-West District have been constructed to provide quick air transportation for interior needs. A thrice weekly scheduled air service connects Bartica, a mining town at the confluence of the Essequibo and Mazaruni Rivers with Georgetown.

K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines) operates a weekly service to and from Georgetown on Sundays.

PUBLIC FINANCE

(See Note on page 27.)

In 1950 the Revenue of the Colony amounted to £4,498,177 and the Expenditure to £4,912,691. (These figures include grants and interest-free loans from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds amounting to £229,833.)

The Public Debt amounted to £4,742,780.

Customs receipts in 1950 amounted to £1,852,566, and Income Tax receipts to £1,231,646.

No grants-in-aid of administration were received during the year.

Public Debt

No loans were raised or redemptions effected during 1950. The Colony’s Funded Debt at 31st December, 1950, amounted to £23,765,343 (£4,951,113), exclusive of the liability in respect of the outstanding Railway Permanent Annuities and Perpetual Stock involving an annual charge of £84,378 (£17,579) but including an amount of £1,135,577 (£236,579) representing loans under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts which have been brought on charge.

The Sinking Fund for the redemption of the Public Debt totalled $2,725,174 (£567,745), the investments having a mean market value of $2,684,938 (£559,362) at the 31st December, 1950.

Debt charges included in Item 1 set off against revenue on Item 9

$23,580,916 100·00 (£4,912,690 16s. 8d.)

Customs Tariffs

The total amount of revenue collected from import duties in 1950, was £778,855 from goods paying specific duties and £619,697 from goods subject to ad valorem rates.

Currency and Banking

The total circulation of all denominations of B.G. Government paper currency on the 31st December, 1950 was $9,431,000, or £1,964,792.

The total circulation at the 31st December, 1950, of bank notes issued by Barclays Bank (D.C. & O.) Limited, and the Royal Bank of Canada, was $741,670, or £154,515.

The circulation media now consist of:

(a) Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Board established in 1951: notes previously issued by the Government and by the Governments of Barbados and Trinidad continue as legal tender but are being withdrawn. The note issuing powers of the local Banks have been terminated.

The currency note systems of the Eastern Group of the British Caribbean Territories (Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and the Windward Islands) were unified in 1951; legislative provision was also made for eventual unification of coin.

Currency notes are of unlimited legal tender.

(b) British silver and bronze coinage, and a local 4d. bit. Silver and bronze coins are legal tender to amounts not exceeding 40s. and 1s. respectively.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), Limited, and the Royal Bank of Canada now have branch establishments with savings bank departments at Mackenzie as well as those at Georgetown and New Amsterdam.

On the 31st December, 1950, Post Office branch banks had a total depositors' liability of $13,595,000, or £2,832,292.

Production and Trade

Sugar and its by-products furnished 54 per cent. in value of the total domestic exports in 1950.

During 1950, 195,651 tons of sugar and 2,700,000 proof gallons of rum were produced. 52,600 tons of rice were produced.

Mining Operations in British Guiana

Production of gold for the year 1950 was 13,740 oz. of bullion, representing a decrease of 7,358 oz. on that for 1949.

The output from the British Guiana Goldfields Ltd. was 7,444 ounces from one dredge operating in the Mahdia, a tributary of the Potaro River. With money which the Colonial Development Corporation invested in this Company, a second-hand, six cubic foot, endless bucket dredge was purchased in the U.S.A. for use on the Company's concession in the lower Potaro River. It has been erected at Tumatumari but operations have been delayed through the late arrival of the power plant.

The output from Cuyuni Goldfields Ltd., 4,199 ounces of bullion, showed a decrease of 928 ounces of bullion on the previous year. This Company completed in October the salvage operation on the re-treatment of tailings left from their previous workings at Aurora Mine, which has now been placed on a care and maintenance basis.

The Tikwah Mining Corporation closed down their operations at Tikwah Mine in March and the personnel was transferred to Peters Mine on the Puruni River, where they are preparing to erect a plant to treat the old tailing dump by the cyanide process.

The Rupununi Gold Mining Company were forced in April to suspend operations temporarily due to exhaustion of capital. The mine remained on a care and maintenance basis and a small quantity of gold was produced by the Caretaker.

Messrs. Phang and Leung Bros., and Dragten and Baird were the chief producers in Barama, N.W.D., and produced 857 ounces for the year, a decrease of 1,754 ounces on their 1949 output.

The Anaconda British Guiana Mines, Limited, decided in August, 1950 to close down gold-prospecting operations and to cancel the options they had with local mining companies. The company had expended a sum of nearly $3,000,000 during the period of their operations.

Output of diamonds for 1950 was 37,462 metric carats, as against 34,790 in 1949, an increase of 2,672 carats.

It is not possible to ascribe the reason for the increase to any particular cause as there were no spectacular discoveries during the year. Prices fluctuated between $44.00 (£9 3s. 4d.) and $4600. (£9 11s. 8d.) per carat. It fell during mid-year to $35.00 per carat for small stones (£7 5s 10d.).

The Mazarruni continues to be the main producer with 25,987.38 metric carats or approximately 75 per cent. of the Colony's production. The Potaro and Rupununi districts have shown notable increases.
The Diamond and Metals Exploration Company Incorporated abandoned their attempt at diamond mining with a 4-inch Walberg Suction Dredge in the Eping Creek.

The total tonnage of bauxite exported in 1950 was 1,583,417 long tons as compared with 1,757,650 long tons in the previous year. Despite this decreased export the value increased to $13,832,442 as compared with $12,009,356 for 1949.

The Demerara Bauxite Company Limited continued to be the main producer with 1,461,653 tons. The Berbice Company Limited produced 121,764 tons. These two companies carried out extensive prospecting operations throughout the year and both have plans for expansion programmes on hand. It is hoped that exports will be increased in 1951. The Demerara Bauxite Company have announced their intention to increase the calcining capacity of their plant at Mackenzie.

Plantation Bauxite Company Ltd., which is jointly owned by the Demerara Bauxite Company and the British and Colonial Bauxite Company (the latter a subsidiary of the British Aluminium Company Ltd.) has been carrying out preliminary surveys on the lands held by the Company under lease, in order to locate a site for a bridge across the Demerara River, so that the ore can be transported across the river for treatment at the Demerara Bauxite Company's plant at Mackenzie.

In 1950, 29 per cent. of exports went to the United Kingdom, 54 per cent. to Canada, 11 per cent. to other British countries, 5 per cent. to the United States of America and 1 per cent. to other foreign countries.

"**Butter**" should be deleted from the list of chief imports on page 97 of *The Colonial Office List* 1951 and "electrical apparatus" should be added.

The United Kingdom supplied 47 per cent. of the imports, Canada 13 per cent., and the United States of America 13 per cent., the remainder being divided chiefly between India, British West Indies, Australia, Netherlands, Italy, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Belgium, Japan and Czechoslovakia.

The total value of imports into British Guiana in 1950 (excluding the value of imports through parcel post and bullion and specie) was £11,471,028. The total value of exports (including gold mined in the Colony and re-exports, but excluding bullion, specie, parcel post and ships' stores) was, £10,568,651.

In 1950 the total tonnage of shipping entered and cleared in British Guiana was 3,967,921, of which the British tonnage amounted to 1,961,141.
