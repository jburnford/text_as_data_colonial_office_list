BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.

The Bahamas, the most northerly of the British West Indian Colonies, are a chain of coral islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N. lat., and 72° 40' and 79° 5' W. long., composed of about 20 inhabited islands, and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, and the Biminis, Watling's Island, all of which are ports of entry; and Great Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Mayaguana, the Berry Islands, and Andros Island (containing the only river). The total area is 4,466 square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

History.

St. Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling's
Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines, and the islands were abandoned. Settlers from the Bermudas found their way in considerable numbers to Eleuthera, in 1646, and in 1666, some years later, also to New Providence. This latter island, and all the others between 23° and 27° N. lat., were granted by Charles II. to a proprietary body in 1670, and in 1671 Captain Johnson Wentworth was appointed by the proprietors to be their first Governor. No regular system of government appears to have been established, however; and New Providence continued to be more or less merely a shelter for pirates and a disorderly set of people. It was laid waste by the Spaniards in 1680 or 1682, and in 1703 the French and Spaniards combined annihilated the settlement. After this it became a regular rendezvous for pirates, who were finally extirpated in 1718 by the English, under Captain Woodes Rogers, and a regular administration formed and colonists introduced, including a considerable number of Germans from the Palatinate. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards, but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed by Great Britain, which was confirmed in their possession at the Peace of Versailles, 1783.

In 1848 the Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, were separated from the other Bahamas, and formed into a distinct Presidency, under the Government-in-Chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

A general descriptive report of the Islands, which includes the Blue Book Report for 1902, illustrated by photographs and a map, has been compiled by a former Governor, Sir Gilbert Carter, and published as a Parliamentary paper (Cd. 1985, 1904).

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is salubrious and very pleasant in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada, there being excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists. The average annual rainfall for the past 5 years was 56·62 inches, the rainy season extending from June to October. The mean temperature is 76·5 degrees, the extreme range being from 92·5 to 52 during the years 1904 to 1908 (5 years). Severe hurricanes were experienced in September and October, 1908, causing loss of life, and much damage and distress in some of the Out Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race. About one quarter are of European descent; English is universally spoken.

Trade and Industry.

The commercial relations of the Colony are mainly with the United States. Considerable quantities of pine-apples (canned) and oranges are exported. In 1908 the exports were as follows:—1,264l. grape fruit; 118,526 doz. pine apple, value 11,856l.; 10,997l. preserved fruits; but the principal export is sponge (94,238l. in 1908).

Cotton, the cultivation of which was introduced by Royalist refugees from the United States, was grown in large quantities prior to the abolition of slavery, and also during the American War, but has ceased to be a staple. The cotton exported in 1908 was valued at 319l., but efforts are being made to re-institute this industry.

The cultivation and preparation of the sisal fibre plant is an important industry, and the quantity and value exported in 1908 was 5,281,449 lbs., value 42,627l. fibre. The estimated area planted at the end of 1908 is considerably over 25,000 acres.

The sugar-cane grows luxuriantly in many of the islands, but is little cultivated.

An agricultural station was established at Nassau in 1905, and experiments are being made in the cultivation of tobacco, rubber, cassava, cotton, etc.

The Colony enjoyed great prosperity during the American Civil War, when it was the headquarters of many blockade running operations.

Fishing is extensively carried on for the Nassau market, over 100 native-built boats, with 500 men, being employed. Turtle-shell, shells and pearls are largely exported. Sponge-fishing employs a large fleet. In 1905 the approximate number of vessels engaged in the industry was 492—aggregate tonnage 5,185—with 2,463 open boats, and numerous long shore open boats; men and boys employed 5,299; and 277 men and women in clipping, sorting and pecking for export. Nassau is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1907, 713 ships registered, of 30,743 tons.

Salt-raking, one of the earliest industries, has fallen off altogether, the export of salt in 1908 being only 82l., as compared with 2,470l. in 1890. There is no market in America for Bahamas salt. Some of the islets yield guano. The chief imports are textile fabrics, bread stuffs, spirits, and wines. Lumber is exported in competition with Jacksonville.

Lighthouses on several of the islands have been established, and are maintained by the Imperial Government at a cost of 10,000l. per annum, exclusive of stores supplied from England. Several lights are also maintained by the local government.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States current coin, silver of the Latin Union. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is no Colonial currency. A local bank, called the Bank of Nassau, was established on 1st June, 1889. It had, on 31st December, 1908, a note issue of 6,500l., and deposits amounting to 66,000l. A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1908, 31,628l. deposited.

Means of Communication.

There are no railways (except at Abaco in connection with the lumber industry), or telegraphs in the Colony, and but few good roads except in New Providence. There is regular fortnightly mail communication with New York and Cuba, and frequent vessels to and from Cuba and Key West. There is also a regular mail service during the winter months, from January to April, between Nassau and Miami, Florida. These vessels make voyages as often as two and three times weekly. Till February, 1892, the nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe was Key West, but in that month a cable from Nassau
to Florida was completed. The rates of postage are:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Internal U.K., and the Empire* | 1d. per oz. Free. |
| Foreign Postal Union Countries | 2½d. per oz. & ½d. per 2 oz. |
| | 1½d. for each successive unit |

A parcels post with the United Kingdom and the United States has been established, also money order agreements with the United States and Canada.

**Constitution.**

The Executive Government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor, aided by an Executive Council not exceeding 9 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council, nominated by the Crown, and a Representative Assembly of 29 members, elected for 5 districts by persons owning land of the value of £1., or occupying houses of the rental value of 22. 8s. in New Providence, or half that amount in the outlying islands. The qualifications of electors are full age, a residence of 12 months, with land value £1.; or being a householder of premises value 22. 8s. in New Providence, or 1l. 4s. elsewhere, for six months. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 200l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members who have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature.

**Education.**

There is a Government system of elementary education, established 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1885, and Consolidating Act of 1908. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local Committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

There are 46 unsectarian Government schools, with 5,917 scholars; 14 aided schools, with 1,275 scholars; 30 Church of England and 17 private schools, with 1,948 Church of England and Private scholars; 3 Roman Catholic schools, with 492 scholars. The Government schools were made free in 1885. The compulsory clauses of the law are enforced only in Nassau and the larger villages. Higher education is provided at the Nassau Grammar School, the Queen's College, and St. Hilda's School, all in Nassau.
