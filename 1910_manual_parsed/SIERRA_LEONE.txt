SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Sierra Leone has a coast-line of 210 miles, extending between 6° 55' and 9° 2' N. lat., from the territory of the Republic of Liberia on the south-east, where the Manneh River forms the boundary, as far as Kiragba on the north-east; about midway on this coast there is a block of land about 23 miles in length with a mean width of about 14 miles, forming the oldest portion of the Colony; about 100 miles south-east from this block there is another about 80 miles in length, with a varying width not definitely ascertained, forming the Sherbro District. The rest of the Colony consists of a strip of land along the sea and river shores of half a mile in depth inland from high-water mark in some places, and a quarter of a mile in others; and of the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellalob, Kortimo, Tasso, Macaulay, and other islets. The strip of shoreline was acquired for the purpose of securing an effective control over the importation of sea-borne goods into the main portions of the Colony.

Immediately adjoining the Colony of Sierra Leone lying to the northward and eastward is the Protectorate, the northern boundaries of which were defined by the Agreement between Great Britain and France which was concluded on the 21st January, 1895. The extreme depth from south to north is about 210 miles, lying between 7° and 10° N. lat., and the extreme breadth from east to west is 180 miles, lying between 10° 40' and 13° 20' W. long. The estimated area of the Colony and Protectorate is 32,000 square miles.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession by King Nembana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government," of a piece of land described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a party of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were struggling waifs in and about London. Somewhat later the Colony was much used as a settlement for Africans rescued from slave ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory of the Colony received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, King Farina and King Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the Colony; and in 1861 Bai Conteh, King of Kwaiha, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwaiha country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with the King and chiefs of Sherbro, Bagru, Sherbro Island, and some other places, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. This treaty was not ratified by the Crown, but was revived by a fresh agreement made in 1882. A number of other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued of a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which is divided into six districts as follows:

Headquarters District—Headquarters, Waterloo
Karene " Batkanu
Ronietta " Moyamba
Railway " Konneima
Koinadugu " Kaballa
Sherbro " Bonthe

Of these, the Headquarters and Sherbro Districts are composite, in that they consist of territories which are partly in the Colony proper, partly in the Protectorate.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. According to the same letters patent, the Governor of Sierra Leone is aided by an Executive Council composed of four officials and the officer in command of the troops. The Legislative Council, of which the Governor is ex-officio president, is composed of the members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Collector of Customs and with the addition of the Chief Justice, as ex-officio members, together with the Senior District Commissioner as an official, but not ex-officio, member, and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

Climate.

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The temperature varies during the year from about 65° to 96°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur in the rainy season, especially at its commencement and close. They
are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The rainfall in Freetown for the year 1908 was 142.49 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from N.E. to S.E.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is unhealthy, and malarial fever is prevalent. The general death-rate for Freetown was 21 per thousand in 1907, and 22 per thousand in 1908. A large proportion of this is due to a decreasing, but still heavy infantile mortality, which in 1908 was 351 per thousand.

It is estimated that there were 550 Europeans in the Colony in 1908, among whom there were 12 deaths, exclusive of one landed from a steamer.

Natives of West Africa suffer considerably from malarial fever, but the type is not so severe as among Europeans.

**General Description.**

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 1,700 feet above the sea. In 1908 it was estimated to contain 37,632 inhabitants, but owing to an additional large transitory population the number of persons in Freetown at any given time is rarely under 40,000. It possesses the best harbour in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of about 76,773. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities. The extent of the territory is small, the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation, and the people of the Colony seem not much attracted to that form of industry.

The Sherbro District exports considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piassava, with other articles of lesser importance. A large proportion of the exports of Sherbro are really the products of the Protectorate.

The configuration and soil of the Protectorate vary much in different localities. Some parts are low and swampy, in others the country is mountainous, rising in places to an altitude of over 3,000 feet. Many districts are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, indiarubber trees and vines, benni seeds, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, rice, cotton, and other tropical products. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa, the country is, for the most part, well watered by rivers and running streams, which are, however, not navigable. No minerals have been discovered, except iron, which can hardly be reckoned as of exportable value.

The population of the Protectorate is estimated at 1,175,000, and is composed of the following tribes:

- **Headquarters District—Temnes, Bulloms, Mendes**
- **Karene**
- **Ronietta**
- **Railway**

There are practically no industries at present. The inhabitants of Freetown and the Colony generally are traders and shop-keepers, and do little in the way of agriculture beyond the planting of cassava. In the Protectorate the inhabitants plant farms, chiefly of rice and cassava, and collect natural products for sale to the various merchants and traders of the Colony. The staple food of the inhabitants is rice.

The products from the Protectorate which constitute the principal exports are palm kernels, palm oil, benni seed, ground nuts, kola nuts, indiarubber, copal, hides, and ginger. Cotton has for many years been cultivated by the natives, some of whom manufacture a considerable number of native clothes. The British Cotton Growing Association made an experiment in cotton growing on European principles, which was not successful, chiefly owing to the withering effect of the harmattan wind. The principal imports are spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, groceries, etc., and hardware. More than two-thirds of the total imports in 1908 came from the United Kingdom, which also received about one-fifth of the exports.

**Currency and Banking.**

Besides British currency, gold doubloons, eagles, and the coins of the Latin union are current and legal tender. There is no Colonial coinage, and no note circulation. The British Bank of West Africa has a branch in the Colony. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had, invested by the end of 1908, the sum of £1,661.

**Education.**

A system of Government grants and inspection was established in 1882. There are 75 assisted elementary schools in the Colony, with 7,733 scholars at end of 1907; they are all denominational, and charge fees. Education is not compulsory. There are four secondary boys' schools in Freetown—the Grammar School (C.M.S.), the High School (Wesleyan), the Educational Institute, and the Albert Academy (United Brethren in Christ). The Church Missionary Society has a training college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University; and a Wesleyan Theological College has lately been established. There are also in Freetown three high schools devoted to female education. A scheme for the education, on Western lines, of Mohammedan children was started in 1901. There are now four Mohammedan Schools or Madrassas in Freetown supported by the Government, with 575 pupils on the roll in 1908. A Government school for the sons and nominees of native chiefs was established at Bo in the Railway District of the Protectorate on 1st March, 1906, under European supervision. The number of pupils at the close of the year 1908 was 102. The foundation-stone of the Thomas Agricultural Academy at Matang in the Protectorate, founded in accordance with the bequest of 60,000l. by the late Mr. S. B. Thomas, a native of Sierra Leone, was laid in January, 1909.
Means of Communication.

Steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown every Saturday, and for Madeira and Freetown every other Wednesday. The average length of passage is 12 days to Freetown. There is also regular steam communication with Hamburg, Havre, Marseilles, and Lisbon.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively. The main line of the Sierra Leone Government Railway, was the first Railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Baiima in the Railway District, a distance of 230 miles. The number of stations on the main line is 27. Two tramways were opened for traffic in 1908, the one continuing the main line from Baiima to Pendembu, a distance of 7 miles, and the other running from Boia Station, 63 miles from Freetown, in a north-easterly direction to the Yonni terminus, 21 miles distant. The gauge of the Railway and Tramway is 2 ft. 6 in., and the same rolling stock is used on both. A number of roads have been constructed to act as feeders to the railway and tramways.

There is another line, known as the Mountain Railway, which connects Freetown with the cantonment for European Officials at the Hill Station, 6 miles distant.

The total railway receipts for 1908 were £71,909; the working expenses of the main line for the same year were £63,483.

There are 298 miles of telegraph, viz., Freetown-Baiima, Freetown-Hill Station, and Mano Station-Bendu (opposite Bonthe, Sherbro). Horses do not thrive.

The Sherbro river is navigable for over 20 miles (up to Yorktown), the Sierra Leone, or Rokell river, for 40 miles (as far as Magbile).

SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE.

In 1884, a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali Coast, extending from Lahadu (Loyi-ada), half-way between Ras Jibouti and Zeyla, to the 49th meridian E.long. The boundary has been settled by agreements with France, Italy and King Menelik of Abyssinia. Till 1898, the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden, as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year, it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, and on 1st April, 1905, to that of the Colonial Office. The chief ports are Berbera, Bulhar and Zeyla. Area about 68,000 square miles.

Exports consist of skins and hides, sheep and cattle, gums, ostrich feathers, salt, ivory, and gold ingots.

Imports consist of rice, dates, cotton piece goods and shirtings, iron and hardware.

All transport is by animals. There is a weekly steamer service with Aden.

The climate at the coast is trying for Europeans, but is healthy in the interior, where an elevation of from 4,500 feet to 6,800 feet is reached.

The Haud waterless plains constitute the principal pastures of the country. The chief source of wealth of the people lies in their live stock.

In the beginning of 1901, operations were commenced against a fanatical Somali leader, the Mullah Mohammed Abdullah, and a native levy with British Officers, under Captain (local Lieut.-Colonel) E. J. E. Swayne, Indian Army, penetrated into the Nogal Valley. After defeating the Mullah at Somala and Fordiddin, and killing 1,200 men and taking 600 prisoners, he drove him into Italian territory.

The dervishes afterwards gathered together again, and a similar expedition, strengthened by the 2nd King's African Rifles (Yaos), was despatched under Colonel Swayne in the summer of 1902, and again drove the Mullah into Italian territory with heavy loss, but met with a severe check in Italian territory at Erego, on October 6th. The Mullah, however, retired as the result of this action still further into Italian territory, to Geladi.

Five months later a third expedition, co-operating with the Abyssinian Army, under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel (local Brigadier-General) W. H. Manning, Insp.-General K.A. Rifles, comprising British and Boer M.I., Indian and African troops, with the main base at Obbia in Italian Somaliland, proceeded to Mudug, thence detaching a force under Lieut.-Colonel Cobbe, V.C., to Geladi, which place was up till then the head-quarters of the enemy. A force of 200 Yaos and Sikhs, under the late Lieut.-Colonel Plunkett, was overwhelmed at Gumburru, in April, 1903, after a fight of the fiercest description. A column of 200 men under Major Gough, being at the same time attacked at Daratoleh, whence it retired fighting to Bohotleh, and in June the expedition fell back on the Berbera-Bohotleh lines of communication, when Lieut.-General Sir C. C. Egerton, K.C.B., was placed in command.

Reinforcements, increasing the force to 7,000 rifles, were despatched and placed in the field, and in January, 1904, 3,250 troops defeated 5,000 dervishes at Jidballi, about 1,000 of the latter being killed.

In March, 1905, an agreement was concluded between the Italian Government and the Mullah Seyyid Mahommed, whereby peace was declared between the dervishes and the neighbouring tribes, both those subject to the Government of Italy and those under the protection of the British Government. The Mullah was given a port on the east coast and was assigned certain territories within the Italian sphere of interest, beyond which he and his dervishes undertook not to encroach.

In the latter part of 1908, some unrest was caused by the unfriendly attitude of the Mullah, such a manner as to enable them after a time to protect themselves.

Arrangements are still in progress for arming and organising the British protected tribes in and some troops were brought up from Nyasaland, East Africa and Uganda early in 1909.

SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union.

After the grant of responsible government to the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony the question of the Union of the South African Colonies was actively discussed, and in 1908, at an Inter-colonial Conference at Pretoria, the principle of closer union was adopted; this was shortly followed by a National Convention, which held sessions at Durban, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein, and framed a draft Act. The draft was agreed to by the Transvaal Parliament without a single amendment, but in the Orange River Colony and the Cape objections were made with regard to the questions of "equal rights" and "one vote one value." Eventually the difficulties were overcome, and by June, 1909, the Constitution arranged had been agreed to by every Colony. A delegation came to England to confer with the Secretary of State, and in the result a Bill representing the measure as agreed to by H.M.'s Government and the four self-governing Colonies was presented to Parliament. Under the circumstances any amendment by Parliament became almost out of the question, and the bill was passed without any; but a strong attack was made on those provisions of it which disqualify persons of non-European descent from membership of the Union Parliament, and leave the natives, except those in the Cape, without direct representation.

The Constitution thus arrived at differs deeply in principle from those of Canada and Australia, which are akin to that of the United States. These latter are examples of federalism, the chief characteristics of which are the supremacy of the constitution, the distribution among bodies with limited and co-ordinate authority of the different powers of government, and the authority of the Courts to act as the interpreters of the Constitution. The South African Constitution, on the other hand, is a case of unification; the Parliament, not the Constitution, is supreme; power resides ultimately in the Parliament; the Courts have no final authority. It is remarkable that South Africa should have succeeded in so short time in effecting a union in which local is subordinated to national feeling, and the explanation may be found in the bitter experience of the evils of disunion, and the special problems which interest all the colonies alike, and of which the native question is perhaps the gravest.

The Act provides that the King may declare by proclamation that, on a day therein named, the colonies of the Cape, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony shall be united in a Legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa. The four colonies will then become provinces of the Union. The King is to appoint a Governor-General, who will appoint not more than ten officers to administer the public departments and to be members of the Executive Council.

Pretoria is to be the seat of Government, and Cape Town of the Legislature—a compromise which can hardly fail to cause inconvenience, but which will keep the Government in close contact with two centres representing the continental and marine interests of the country. For ten years the Senate will consist of eight members nominated by the Governor-General in Council, and eight members for each province elected by the two Houses of the province sitting as one body. Power is given to make regulations for this election, and these regulations have been made and published; they represent an adaptation of the single transferable vote or proportional representation. The House of Assembly, in the first instance, is to consist of elected members as follows:

| Province          | Members |
|-------------------|---------|
| Cape              | 51      |
| Natal             | 17      |
| Transvaal         | 36      |
| Orange River Colony | 17     |

This arrangement gives the Cape and Transvaal a smaller and the other two a larger representation than they are strictly entitled to, but provision is made for an increase of the numbers proportionate to population, and eventually the constitution of the House will be on a national instead of a provincial basis. The qualifications of voters are to be the same as in the colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership. [In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise is restricted to white men; in Natal a native can obtain a vote, but under conditions which make this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native can do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.] Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent. A Commission is to be appointed to divide the provinces into electoral divisions, and density or sparsity of population may, to a limited extent, be taken into account. Disagreements between the two Houses are to be settled by joint sittings. There will be an administrator and an executive council of each province appointed by the Union Government, and a provincial council of the same number of members (not less than 25) as are elected to the House of Assembly; the legislative powers of these bodies are to include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for 5 years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game
preservation and other purely local or private matters.

There will be a Supreme Court of South Africa, with an Appellate Division, and the present Supreme Courts of the colonies will become provincial divisions of that Supreme Court. There will be no appeal to the King in Council, but this will not impair any right which the King in Council may be pleased to exercise to grant special leave to appeal from the Appellate Division to the King in Council. The Appellate Division will ordinarily sit in Bloemfontein. All revenues, which the colonies can now appropriate, will vest in the Governor-General in Council, and a Railway and Harbour Fund will be formed which will manage these undertakings, subject to the Governor-General in Council, and advise on any new schemes. A Commission will be appointed to enquire into the financial relations between the Union and the Provinces, and in the meantime payments will be made to the latter on the basis of the colonial estimates for 1908-9. Colonial property, including crown lands, and rights in mines and minerals, railways and harbours, will vest in the Union, which will assume colonial debts. Compensation is to be paid to Pietermaritzburg and Bloemfontein for ceasing to be seats of government, and may, after enquiry, be payable to Cape Town and Pretoria. The election of senators and of members of the executive committee of the provincial councils will be according to the principle of proportional representation, each voter having one transferable vote. There will be free trade throughout the Union. Both the English and Dutch languages will be official, and will be treated on a footing of equality. A Public Service Commission will report on the reorganisation of the departments. Power is given to the King, with the advice of the Privy Council, and on addresses from the Union Parliament, to admit into the Union the territories administered by the British South Africa Company, or those which belong to or are under the protection of His Majesty, and are inhabited wholly or in part by natives. The Union Parliament may alter any of the provisions of the Act, subject to certain conditions in the cases of the number of members of the House of Assembly, the qualification of voters, and the equality of languages.

The date appointed for the inception of Union is 31st May, 1910.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa was created by Letters Patent in 1878. In 1879 a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who was also Governor of Natal (which now includes Zululand and Amatongaland). The High Commissioner for South Africa, who, under the Commission of 1889, was the officer for the time being administering the Government of the Cape, represents the Crown in all matters occurring in South Africa beyond the limits of the Colonies properly so called. He was, till 1899, charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native states and tribes outside the Colonies of the Cape and Natal, including Swaziland, which was administered by the Government of the South African Republic under the Convention of 1894.

The High Commissioner is Governor of Basutoland, supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland, and exercises the control provided by Order in Council over the Administration of the British South Africa Company in Southern and in North-Western Rhodesia. The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898, provides for a control by the High Commissioner over legislation, important appointments, and Native affairs in Rhodesia, and for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, who is paid from Imperial funds and acts as the local representative of the High Commissioner and the Imperial Government. The High Commissioner is empowered to invite conferences of representatives of the South African Colonial Governments to meet for the discussion of matters of common interest. The office of High Commissioner, which was formerly held by the Governor of Cape Colony, was, by a Commission dated Oct. 6th, 1900, vested in Lord Milner, and by a similar Commission, dated March 15th, 1905, in Lord Selborne, who is also Governor of the Transvaal.
