STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Labuan, Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 48 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 288 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 265 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat., and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed, by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent, dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ½ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. The population is 698. The boundaries of the Settlement of Singapore have been extended so as to include these islands.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 230 miles S.W. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., annexed in June, 1888, was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889, and was formally annexed to the Settlement of Singapore in 1900. It is twelve miles long and five miles wide; wooded, and has about 1,200 inhabitants. There is a rich deposit of phosphate of lime on this island.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued to the existing Governor of the Straits Settlements in 1906, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent State from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were successful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken possession of by the English, and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland of the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bencoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should leave the Malay Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786; when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch restrictions; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon (Puket or Tongkah), and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dola. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy
the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 288 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and cocoanuts. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Péral in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Native Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British, and the whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The old city of Singapore flourished and was destroyed in the 14th century. Thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. It was at first subordinate to Bengooloo (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated, in 1826, with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 9 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Climate.

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1908 was 82° F.; in Penang, 81° F.; in Province Wellesley, 83° F.; and in Malacca, 81° F. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures were between 93° and 73° F. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1898 to 1908, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 173 wet days; the average rainfall for the same period being 93·81 inches. In 1908 the mean rainfall in Singapore was 84·18 inches; in Penang 119·86 inches; in Province Wellesley 106·06 inches; in Malacca 64·72 inches; and in the Dindings 74·44 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. But it is nothing unusual to have southeast, south or south-west winds for portions of the day as early as March or April.

Population.

At the census taken in April, 1891 and 1901, the population of the Settlements was ascertained to be as follows:

|                | 1891     | 1901     |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Singapore      | 184,564  | 228,555  |
| Penang, Province Wellesley, and Dindings | 235,618 | 268,267 |
| Malacca        | 92,170   | 95,45    |
| Total          | 512,342  | 572,249  |

The total at the census of 1886 was 273,000. " " " 1871 " " 307,961. " " " 1881 " " 423,384.

Trade.

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 1 anna per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca and rice (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley). The approximate quantities of some of the exports in 1908 were coffee, 3,196 tons; gambier, 32,041 tons; principal gums, *25,683 tons; principal spices, 88,649 tons; tapioca, 45,066 tons; copra, 63,356 tons; copra, 77,430 tons; rattans, 26,889 tons; preserved pineapples, 717,216 cases; and sugar, 64,871 tons. The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The quantities imported in 1908 were Cotton piece goods, 3,488,14 pieces; coal, 735,400 tons; rice 519,869 tons; opium, 11,592 chests; silk piece goods, 177,095 pieces; petroleum (cases of 65 lbs.), 1,250,47 cases; sarongs (cargoes of 20 pieces), 248,314 cargoes; fish (dry and salted), 53,450 tons; tobacco, 5,989 tons; tin ore, 68,604 tons; and wheat flour, 29,012 tons. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, the Dutch Indies, Siam, and the Native State Singapore and George Town (Penang) are port of registry; Singapore had, on the 31st December, 1908, 659 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 79,577 tons.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe via Ceylon, and with China and Japan weekly by the P. and O., Messageries Maritimes; in addition there is a fortnightly service to India, and fortnightly by packets of the North.

* Para Rubber, 3,661,589 lbs., included in gums.
deutscher-Lloyd and Hamburg-American Line, and the Steamship Company "Nederland" Line; and at frequent intervals by Holt's, East Asiatic, Austro-Hungary Lloyd's, British India, Glen, Japanese, and other lines; with Cochin China weekly by the Messageries Maritimes; with Manilla via Hong Kong and by Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok weekly by Nord-deutscher-Lloyd and other steamers; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by Messageries Maritimes and Netherlands India Company's steamers; with Australian ports weekly, and otherwise by P. and O. and Messageries Maritimes, via Ceylon, by British India, China Navigation Company, and other lines; with Madras (direct), and other ports on the Coromandel Coast, fortnightly by the Negapatam steamers; and with Rangoon and Calcutta weekly by the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, British India, Apar, and other steamers. In addition to the above, there is frequent communication with Penang, Malacca, and other ports of the Native States, Hong Kong, etc., by local lines; and the Norddeutscher-Lloyd has a large fleet of steamers running between Singapore and most of the neighbouring foreign ports. Most of the larger steamers call at Penang. Letters from England reach Singapore in from 21 to 24 days.

Postage and Communications.

| Letters, Newspapers, cents. | per 2 oz. cents. |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Within the Colony, and to the Federated Malay States, Johore, British North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei, per 2 oz. ... | 3 1 |
| To U.K., Egypt, India, and the Colonies which have adopted the Imperial Penny Postage, etc., per oz. ... | 4 1 |
| Elsewhere, for the first oz. ... | 8 |
| For every succeeding oz. ... | 5 |

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1907 to $2,173,145, the principal business done being with the United Kingdom, India, and the Federated Malay States.

There is telegraphic communication by 3 submarine cables from Penang to Madras, Malacca, and Singapore; and from Singapore there are 3 cables (1) to Saigon and Hong Kong, (2) to Labuan and Hong Kong, (3) to Saigon, Hué, Haiphong, Hainan, and Hong Kong. There is also a Government telegraph line from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Péraç, Selângor, Sungei-Ujong, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 244 miles of telegraph line, 29 miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley, and 5,154 miles of telephone line. There is a telephone exchange worked by the Oriental Telephone Company in Singapore, and two worked by the Post Office, one in Penang and the other in Province Wellesley. A railway, 23 miles long, connects Pral in Province Wellesley with the Péraç railway system. A railway, 15 miles long, from the docks of Singapore* to Kranji, on the Straits of Johore, constructed by the Colonial Government, is now open for traffic. A railway connecting the town of Malacca with Pulau-Sebang, on the borders of Negri-Sembilan, forms part of the Federated Malay States Railway system. Reclamation and harbour works are in progress at Singapore.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which will be under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children in Malacca, Province Wellesley and Penang Island outside municipal limits. It is not compulsory in Singapore or Penang Town. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided by Government, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are unsectarian. A reformatory for juvenile offenders and vagrants has been opened, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1908 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 7 | 2,566 | 2,414 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 30 | 8,747 | 7,922 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 175 | 11,824 | 9,814 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 3 | 111 | 87 |
| Total. | 215 | 23,248 | 20,237 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin is of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 6th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Committee were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of £60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In

view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold.

Local silver and copper coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and $1 respectively. The half-dollar is now unlimited legal tender.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the International Banking Corporation, the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands Commercial Bank; the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; National Bank of China, Ltd.; Kwong Yik Banking Company, Ltd.; and Sye Hai Thong Banking and Insurance Company.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes. The average amount of notes issued and in circulation in 1908 was $1,277,340.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Dec. 1899 — $3,920,000
" " " " 1900 — $6,105,000
" " " " 1901 — $9,178,000
" " " " 30th June, 1902 — $12,395,900
" " " " 1903 — $15,290,490
" " " " 1904 — $17,102,490
" " " " 1905 — $17,209,105
" " " " 31st August, 1906 — $24,786,105
" " " " 1907 — $26,974,555
" " " " 31st July, 1908 — $22,331,705
" " " " 31st August, 1909 — $27,569,475

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Government savings bank at each settlement. On 31st December, 1908, the deposits amounted to $646,470.

A scheme was in 1902 drawn up for placing the salaries of the higher officers in the service of the S.S. and Federated Malay States Governments on a sterling basis from 1st January, 1903. Existing higher officers had the option of accepting a salary in sterling (to be paid in dollars locally according to a monthly rate of exchange), or in the alternative, continue to draw their dollar salary together with exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar = 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave pay and pension at home. From 1907 a local allowance of 10 per cent. was sanctioned temporarily for three years to the same officers.

The native Weights are:
1 kati = 16 tahil = 1 lb.
100 kati = 1 picul = 133½ lbs.
40 picul = 1 koyan = 533¾ lbs.

Local Government.

There are Municipal Boards at Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, the members of which are partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor.

The total revenue of the municipalities for the year 1908 was $3,524,494; and the expenditure $3,311,960.

LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30-23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

The island, then uninhabited, was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the Island. Hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success, but, in 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited, by whom the mines are at present being developed.

The coal from the Brooketon mine of the Rajah of Sarawak is exported from Labuan, and, in 1906, 11,881 tons were brought over for sale.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty, and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the old jetties to coal.

A stone pier, with a wooden T-head to allow of coal wagons being directly discharged into vessels drawing 27 feet, has been constructed by the coal company.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton from standcocks close to the piers, and H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 1½s. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans,
tortoise-shell, and bêche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is no bank or savings bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins. Straits notes also circulate in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

Two schools are aided by Government grants, but there are no Government schools, and education is not compulsory.

The Government was until the end of 1906 administered by a Governor, who, under Letters Patent of 6th November, 1889, alone made ordinances, there being no legislative council. Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant-in-aid, but since then the Colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony, which in turn was replaced by armed constabulary from British North Borneo. At the end of 1889 it was arranged that the Governor of the territory of the British North Borneo Company should be appointed Governor of Labuan. This arrangement came to an end in 1905, and from 1st January, 1906, the present Governor of the Straits was commissioned as Governor of Labuan. By Letters Patent issued towards the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of Labuan in the Colony of the Straits Settlements, and the incorporation took effect from the 1st January, 1907.

A railway has been made, 2 feet 5 inch gauge, and of about 10 miles in length, from Victoria Harbour to the coal mines at Coal Point. The railway is the property of the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited.

The Labuan Water Company was started in 1885, and, with two miles of piping, supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with potable water.

The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has connected Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong by cable via Labuan. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

Steamers go about twice a month to Singapore, and also to North Borneo and Sula. Most of the vessels calling at Labuan are engaged in the North Borneo trade, and ply regularly between the ports of that State, Singapore, and Manila, making Labuan a port of call, while several vessels call for bunker and cargo coal, on their way to and from northern ports of China, and the Philippines.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are cheaply supplied by a Navy contractor. Labuan has joined the Postal Union and the Imperial Penny Post.

The chief sources of revenue are the farming of licences to sell tobacco, spirits, opium (retail), and the rent of market stalls.

### BRUNEI

Brunei is a state lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. Out of this original state the territories of the North Borneo Company and the Raja of Sarawak have been carved, and it appears to have been at one time powerful, claiming jurisdiction over a large part of Borneo as well as over part of the Philippines. Its area is now only about 4,000 miles, with a population of about 30,000.

The outlying districts are Tutong, Belait and Tamburong, with others of less importance.

An agreement was concluded with the Sultan in 1888, under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan.

A further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 100 in the capital. The principal imports are cloth and sundries, and the principal exports coal, cutch, rotans, sago and damar. The trade, to which an impetus has been given by the inauguration of a new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

A cutch factory has been established by a London syndicate at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muara (Brooketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882.

The Sultan and his leading ministers would derive a considerable income from the yearly cession payments made by the British North Borneo and Sarawak Governments had they not mortgaged them for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amounts recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from an opium and spirit farm and from the collection of customs duties.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years previous to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1895 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and unofficial European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Resident-General and to the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys so advanced being considered as loans, and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power, they engaged to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

The year 1909 was marked by an important development of the principle of Federation, a Federal Council being created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." The Council, as constituted by the agreement, consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Resident-General, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor, and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British residents and four unofficial members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision is made for the addition, if desired, of the heads
of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficials. The Council will meet at least once a year and will consider the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

Railways.

The length of open line F.M.S. Railways is 468 miles, as follows:—Province Wellesley, Péraç, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Malacca, 23, 204½, 113½, 106, and 21 miles respectively. In addition to the above, 120½ miles of railway have been constructed in the State of Johore, and are worked by the Federated Malay States Railways. The main line connects Prai, on the mainland opposite Penang, with Johore Bharu, which is opposite to Singapore, and steam ferries at either end complete the connection between Penang and Singapore. Branch lines run to Port Weld, Teluk Anson, Tronoh Mines, Batu Caves, Port Swettenham, Port Dickson and Malacca. The length of line under construction is 70½ miles in Pahang, and 14 miles in the Negri Sembilan. The total length of line surveyed is 53 miles in Pahang and 6 miles in Péraç.

Péraç.

H.H. Sir Idris Mersid-el-Aázam Shum, G.C.M.G., Sultan.

Péraç is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 7,700 square miles, is well watered, the Péraç (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Pia, at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown. The cultivation of rubber is now attracting great attention, and such consignments as have been exported have realised very high prices. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 70,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Péraç is 627 of metalled and 65 of unmetalled cart roads, 712 miles of bridle and other paths.

The whole length of the State is traversed by the main line of railway from Penang.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre, and at Kuala Kangsar, where His Highness the Sultan resides. The chief towns are Ipoh (which has made extraordinary progress), Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909* the territory claimed by Péraç for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Péraç, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The New Territory was taken over on the 16th July, 1909, and incorporated in the Upper Péraç District.

Selangor.

H.H. Sultanun bin Almerhum Ruju Musa, C.M.G., Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Péraç, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,200 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Péraç and Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Péraç, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably, as much as 124 inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are during March and April, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population estimated at 45,000. It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 5¾ miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the

There is also a branch of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence. The telegraph system extends all over the State, and the telephone, with the exchange at Kuala Lumpur, is worked over about 400 miles of wire.

There are 57 schools in the State; 50 are maintained by Government for education in native languages, the remainder are grants-in-aid schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels registered during 1908 was 819,483.

The total revenue of the State during 1908 amounted to $8,538,550, and the expenditure to $9,222,072.

There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. The only import duties are those charged on opium and spirituous liquors. In 1908 the gross total value of imports was $23,336,966, and the exports $23,032,437.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1908 was 282,540 piculs, valued at $18,868,027. The area alienated for mining is 72,470 acres, and there are 66,488 Chinese employed exclusively in this industry. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned owing to the fall in price. There are 23,169 acres under cocoanuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides, especially in the coast districts, which appear to be the locality most in favour with rubber prospectors. Most of the large estates have been converted into and sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1908 the area alienated for rubber cultivation was 215,509 acres, of which 87,321 acres were planted up. The value of rubber exported during 1908 was estimated at $3,052,498.

There are 62 miles of metalled town streets, 443 miles of metalled, and 50 miles of gravelled country roads, 191 miles of bridle roads and paths, and 61 miles of natural roads.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Tunku Mohamed, C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti, and Chiefs.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan dates, as at present constituted, from 1895, but a similar Federation was already in existence before that year. The present Federation consists of the following States: Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungai Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at the Coast, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and at Tampin.

The total area of the State is about 2,600 square miles. The population, which stood at 96,028 in 1901 and is now considerably over that figure, is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Tamils.

The value of imports amounted to $4,202,107 in 1908, and that of exports to $6,165,657. The revenue of the State, which in 1908 amounted to $1,807,533, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1908, 30,000 acres of land had been alienated for mining and 230,000 acres for agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative.

The Malay population, numbering some 70,000, is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

Besides rice the chief agricultural products are rubber, gambier and cocoanuts.

During 1908 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows: Rice 35,000 acres, rubber 30,000 acres, gambier 21,000 acres, and cocoanuts 18,000 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses about 50 Malay vernacular schools. There is an English school together with a Convent School for girls at Seremban, which receive grants from Government. Education is much appreciated by the Malays of the Negri Sembilan. A few Tamil vernacular schools also have been opened.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 644 miles, and consists of 394 miles of metalled and 21 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 229 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts. The Federated Malay States railway line passes through the State via Seremban and Tampin. Seremban is also connected by rail with the coast at Port Dickson.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Ahmad Matitham Shah bin Almerhum Ali, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Tronggranu, on the South by the territory of
Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, having an estimated area of some 14,300 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, which was until recently believed to be the highest mountain in the Malay Peninsula, has now been found to be a few feet lower than Gunong Kerbau.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 285 miles, of which 232 are navigable for houseboats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. This mineral has also been discovered at Penjum, Kechau, Selensing, and several other places in the State.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River, and 83 miles by road from Kuala Kubu, on the F.M.S. railway, in the State of Selangor.

The Sultan resides at Pekan, the old capital, near the mouth of the Pahang River.

There is a daily motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles, and from Raub to Bentong, via Tras and Tranum, a distance of 30 miles. The cars meet at Tranum, giving Bentong, a large mining centre, a daily service to and from Kuala Kubu and Kuala Lipis.

A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Raub, Kuala Lipis, and Bentong, and will shortly be extended to Kuantan on the east coast.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan (104 miles), and from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungei Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles.

An important road is now under construction, and will, when completed, connect Benta, a point 16 miles from Kuala Lipis, with Kuantan on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The distance is about 150 miles in length, and it will render accessible large areas of land which are believed to be suitable for both mining and agriculture; but it will at present be difficult to persuade miners and planters to come to Pahang so long as they can find land in the other States, where means of communication are easier and transport expenses lighter.

The construction of a line of railway from Gemas in the Negri Sembilan to Kuala Semantan in Central Pahang, a distance of about 70 miles, has been commenced. This is expected to prove of great value in opening up the State.

The total revenue of the State during 1908 amounted to $814,528, and the expenditure to $1,634,045. Pahang has at present to look to Perak and Selangor for financial support.

In the absence of complete records, it is only possible to estimate the population approximately. The census of 1901 gave a total of 84,113, and the figure is now probably over 100,000.

MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

Johore had entered into a Treaty with Great Britain as early as 1855, and in 1885, the Sultan, by an agreement dated the 11th of December, placed his foreign relations under the control of the British Government. He also undertook to receive a British Agent at his Court when required to do so, but no such appointment was made until January, 1910, when, in consequence of a request received from the Sultan, Mr. D. G. Campbell, Resident of Negri Sembilan, was transferred to Johore to act as His Highness's Adviser.

The other States came under British protection in 1909 as a consequence of a Treaty, signed at Bangkok on March 10th of that year, by which Siam transferred to Great Britain all her rights over them. The transfer was formally effected in July, 1909, and British officers were then appointed to reside at the Courts of the native rulers, and to assist them in the administration of their territories.

Exact details as to these latter States are not at present available, and, as the boundaries have not yet been delimited, no attempt has been made to indicate them on the map of the Malay Peninsula.

The officer administering the Government of the Straits Settlements is His Majesty's High Commissioner for all Protected States in the Peninsula.

Johore.

Sultan, H. H. Ibrahim, K.C.M.G.
British Adviser, D. G. Campbell, 1,500l.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is estimated at about 9,000 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with virgin jungle, and has not yet been fully explored. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and the Johore, which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bharu, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, and Bandar Maharani in Muar.
The population of Johore Bharu is probably about 20,000. The population of the whole State is estimated at about a quarter of a million, four-fifths of the number being Chinese.

The principal products of Johore have hitherto been gambier, pepper, sago, and tapioca. In the last few years rubber has been extensively planted.

Little attention has as yet been given to the mineral resources of the State, but tin is worked in one or two districts, and gold was at one time mined at Mount Ophir. Iron is found in abundance, but owing to the absence of coal no attempt has been made to work it.

The Johore State Railway, to which reference has been made above (see Federated Malay States), runs from Kuala Gemas on the Negri Sembilan border to Johore Bharu, a distance of 120½ miles. The line, which was opened for traffic in July, 1909, was constructed by the Railway Department of the Federated Malay States, the necessary funds being lent by the Federation.

**Kedah.**

*Sultan, H. H. Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibni Ahmat Tajudin.*

*British Adviser, W. G. Maxwell (acting), 1,000l.*

The State of Kedah is bounded on the south and south-east by Perak, on the west by Province Wellesley and the Straits of Malacca, on the north-west by the small dependent state of Perlis and on the north and north-east by Siamese territory.

Reference has been made above (see under Straits Settlements) to the relations between Great Britain and Kedah at the end of the eighteenth century. The East India Company then treated the Sultan as an independent ruler, but even at that date Siam claimed some rights of suzerainty over Kedah. No attempt was, however, made to enforce these claims until 1821, when a Siamese army invaded and occupied the State. A long period of disturbance followed, and the Siamese forces were at one time driven out of the State, but by 1839 all resistance had ceased and in 1843 the Sultan definitely acknowledged the sovereignty of Siam.

Up till 1905 the Government of Siam interfered little in the internal affairs of Kedah, but in that year, mainly in consequence of the fact that financial difficulties had necessitated a loan from the sovereign power, a British officer in the Siamese service was appointed Adviser to the Sultan, and numerous reforms were introduced into the administration. In July, 1909, the State was formally transferred to the protection of Great Britain, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of Bangkok.

The area of Kedah, including the adjacent islands, is estimated at about 3,150 square miles. The interior is broken, hilly country, while the coastal districts consist of level and fertile plains, interrupted by a few peaks, of which the most important is Gunong Jerai (3,986 feet), situated not far from the border of Province Wellesley.

Kedah contains a number of rivers, which form the principal means of communication within the State. The most important are the Muda, in the north-east, the Kedah, in the north, and the Krian, which forms the boundary between Kedah and Perak.

The mineral resources of Kedah have not been fully investigated, though a considerable amount of tin has been produced. At present the State depends mainly on agriculture, the principal products being rice, tapioca, and coconuts. A number of rubber estates have been started within the last few years.

The seat of Government is at Alor Star on the Kedah River. Kulim, not far from the eastern border of Province Wellesley is the centre of the mining industry. The other towns are of small importance.

Alor Star is connected by telegraph both with Bangkok and with Penang, and there is a daily steamship service with the latter port.

The population of Kedah has been estimated at 219,000, but no reliable figures can be obtained. The majority of the inhabitants are Malays, but there is a considerable Chinese element, especially in the mining districts.

The climate is stated to be generally healthy, but the death-rate in Alor Star is high, owing mainly to the defective water supply.

The State of Kedah includes several islands lying off the west coast of the Peninsula. Of these the most important is Pulau Langkawi, which has an excellent land-locked harbour between five and six miles square. The island, the area of which is about 166 square miles, supports a considerable population, mostly fishermen and boat-builders.

The revenue of Kedah for 1910 is estimated at $1,214,140, and the expenditure at $1,219,081.

---

**Perlis.**

*Rajah, H. H. Syed Alwi.*

*British Adviser (and Assistant Adviser to the Sultan of Kedah), M. Frost (acting).* 

The little State of Perlis lies on the north-west of Kedah. Its history is similar to that of Kedah, on which State it is dependent.

The frontier settled by the Boundary Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Bangkok runs through the middle of the former State, leaving a considerable portion of it to Siam. The area of the part transferred to British protection is probably about 240 square miles, containing a population of about 20,000.

There is stanniferous land in the interior, and the export of tin is increasing, but development has been retarded by the difficulty of access to the mining districts. Elsewhere the interior is mostly covered with forest, which gives place near the coast to low alluvial plains, on which padi is grown.

The exports consist of tin and agricultural produce, the trade going direct by river and sea to Penang. Kanga, the capital, is the only town of any importance.

The revenue for 1910 is estimated at $100,000, and the expenditure at $85,000.

**Kelantan.**

*Rajah, H.H. Snik bin Almorhom Sultan Ahmat.*

*British Adviser, J. S. Mason (acting), 1,000l.*

The State of Kelantan, the area of which is about 5,300 square miles, lies on the east side of the Peninsula. It is bounded on the south by Pahang, on the east by Trengganu, on the north by the China Sea, on the north-west by Siamese territory, and on the west by Perak.
As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at a time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, but, in spite of this fact, the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British officer in the Siamese Service as his adviser and to administer the State according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in July, 1903, and since that date great improvements have been affected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on the 15th of July, 1909.

About a fifth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the South. The Gunong Tahan, which is situated on the border of Pahang,* is said to be about 7,000 feet high, and is the second highest peak in the Malay Peninsula. A number of other mountains attain a height of between 5,000 and 6,000 feet.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the Western boundary of the State. The Kelantan river is 120 miles long and is navigable by large boats for nearly 80 miles from its mouth. The basin of this river, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. The Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and Siamese territory, from its source in Bukit Jeli to Kuala Tabar, where it debouches into the China Sea.† The Semerak enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Estimates of the population of Kelantan have placed it as high as 600,000 or as low as 100,000. The most probable figure appears to be rather over 300,000. The great majority of the inhabitants are Malays; the Siamese are said to number about 15,000, and the Chinese about 8,000. The Jakuns or Sakeis, who inhabit the mountains of the interior, are estimated to number about 10,000.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, is the only important town in the State (population about 10,000).

It is stated to be a well laid out town with good metalled roads. It is connected by telegraph with Penang and Bangkok. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 4,000); Tabin (population 3,000); and Bacho (population 2,000), all on the Coast.

The main industries of the State are agricultural, the chief product being rice, the annual harvest of which amounts to about 70,000 tons. Coconuts and betel-nuts are also extensively grown and, as elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, rubber has been largely planted of recent years.

There is reason to believe that tin exists in large quantities, but little is worked at present. Gold has been mined from a very remote period and a considerable quantity is produced annually.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, gold, betel-nuts, rice, dried fish and cattle.

The climate of the State is mild and equable, the temperature in the coastal plains ranging between 69° and 94°. In the hills the range is from 62° to 96°. The yearly rainfall averages about 102 inches in the hills and about 104 inches in the plains.

**Trengganu.**

*Sultan, Zainul-ab-din ibni Marhum Ahmad.*

*British Agent, W. L. Conlay, 700L.*

The State of Trengganu lies to the south-east of Kelantan, along the east coast of the Peninsula. It is bounded on the south and south-west by Pahang and on the north-west by Kelantan.

The exact nature of the Siamese rights over Trengganu was for many years a subject of controversy but no definite attempts were made to enforce Siamese authority. The Sultan never consented to receive a Siamese officer as his adviser, and maintained a position of practical independence until July, 1909, when, after the State had been transferred to the protection of Great Britain, he agreed to the appointment of a British Agent to reside at his Court.

The area of the State is estimated at about 6,000 square miles.

Like Kelantan it consists of a fertile coastal plain, backed by ranges of mountains.

The State is well watered, containing twelve large rivers, the principal being the Trengganu, which rises in the centre of the State and flows into the China Sea, some forty miles from the Kelantan border. Kuala Trengganu, the capital of the State, is situated at its mouth. Other important rivers are the Kemaman, near the Southern frontier, the Besut, near the border of Kelantan, the Stiu, a few miles further South, and the Dungun, which debouches into the China Sea about forty miles north of the Pahang border.

The population is estimated at about 50,000. The people of Trengganu are said to be the most industrious Malays in the Peninsula and there is a comparatively large manufacturing class, employed in the weaving of silk and cotton fabrics, in making native wrappers, and in wood and metal-work. The natives also have a good reputation as boat builders.

A considerable part of the population is employed in fishing and there is a large export of dried fish.

Among the principal agricultural products are rice, maize, tapioca, pepper and coconuts.

The country is rich in tin, the exports of tin and tin-ore in the first six months of 1909 being valued at nearly $190,000. Valuable deposits of monazite have been discovered within the last few years, and iron and galena are said to exist but there has as yet been no systematic prospecting for minerals.

TRANSAAL.

Situation and Area.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange River Colony and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22°30' degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude.

Its area is 111,996 square miles, with a population, according to the census of 17th April, 1904, of 1,289,951, of whom 297,277 are whites, 937,127 aboriginal natives, and 35,547 other coloured races. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea. The climate is healthy, except in the lower country, to the north and east, which is hot and often feverish. The winter is the dry, and the summer the wet season. Heavy thunder storms are frequent in summer.

History.

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1858, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000/. In Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000/. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetewayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuna chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerrilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of the public. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided negative.

In December, 1890, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were immediately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender.

The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Maritzburg to relieve them. A large force of Boers, determined to oppose his entry into the Transvaal, took possession of Laing's Nek, the path by which he had to cross the Drakensberg range.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February.
in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr. Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroey Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice, with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs; that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuanaland tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, is of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, factories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the
South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to £77,877, had risen in 1890 to £229,061, reaching £329,958 in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1895, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his intervention Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as
express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years' offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years' franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

Aftersome correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissance from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveley after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronje was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.
The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brehmer, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the
Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1906, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieutenant-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

**Constitution.**

On December 6th, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The new legislature consists of two chambers. The Legislative Council contains 15 members, who are in the first instance nominated by the Governor for a period of five years. Appointments to fill any vacancies which may occur are made by the Governor in Council, by whom also the President is appointed. But it is lawful at any time after four years from the date of the first meeting of the Council for the Legislature to pass a law providing for the election of members of the Legislative Council. Members of the Council must be of the age of 30 years or upwards, must have resided in the Colony for three years, and must possess the electoral qualification. The Legislative Assembly contains 69 members, of whom 34 represent the Witwatersrand area. Members are returned throughout the Transvaal by single-member constituencies, but the old magisterial districts are retained as separate units, and sub-divided where a district is entitled to more than one member, the divisions following as far as possible the boundaries of the old field countries or magisterial wards. Every white male British subject is entitled to be registered as a voter if he has resided in the Transvaal for six months, either immediately before the framing of the register or within three years, in case of temporary absence during those six months. The qualification for membership of the Assembly is the same as the voter's qualification. There is an automatic re-distribution of seats, on a voters' basis, at the end of every four years. The Legislative Assembly and any elected Legislative Council are dissolved at the end of five years, or earlier at the option of the Governor. The Speaker of the Assembly is elected by the members, and will on election vacate his seat. The language of debate in the Legislature will be either English or Dutch, the language of record being English, while copies of votes and proceedings, and of all proposed laws, will be printed in both languages, in accordance with the practice observed in Cape Colony. It is provided that, in the event of disagreement between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the Governor may convene a joint sitting of the members of both Houses, presided over by the Speaker of the Assembly, when the matter at issue shall be decided by an absolute majority of the members of both Houses. Members of the Legislature receive as payment for their services a fixed sum of £150 and £2 a day for each day of attendance up to a maximum of £300 in any one year. The Legislature has power to alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Letters Patent, but any bill effecting such repeal or alteration must be reserved.

A special clause in the Letters Patent provides that whereas it is His Majesty's will and pleasure that all persons within his dominions shall be free from any conditions of employment or residence of a servile character, the Governor shall reserve any law providing for the introduction into the Colony under contract, indenture or licence of labourers from places outside South Africa.

Another clause provides for the termination of the system of labour deriving effect from "The Labour Importation Ordinance, 1904," and all Ordinances amending the same, at the end of one year from the date of the first meeting of the Legislature. Under this clause no licence can be issued for the introduction of labourers into the Colony under the Ordinance, and no contracts can be renewed under its authority after the commencement of the Letters Patent. The Legislature of the Colony may accelerate the determination of the said system of labour or regulate it subject to the conditions of the Letters Patent, and may provide for all necessary matters and for carrying into effect the declarations and enactments of the Letters Patent in that behalf.

Provision is made in regard to the interests of the natives by enacting that no lands which have been or may hereafter be set aside for their occupation shall be alienated or diverted from this purpose, except by legislation which will be liable to be reserved for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure. The Governor will continue to exercise over all Chiefs and natives in the Colony the authority vested in him as paramount Chief, and the Governor in Council is empowered to convene an assembly of native Chiefs to enable the natives to make known their views on questions affecting their interests.

Special provision is made in the Letters Patent with regard to the Land Settlement scheme which was established during the period of Crown Colony government. The Governor was to appoint and control for five years a Land Board consisting of three members, which will be a body corporate, and will exercise the rights and duties conferred and imposed upon the Government of the Transvaal in respect of the existing settlers by any Law or Agreement.

To this Land Board were to be transferred all lands and movable property held by existing settlers and any sums approved by a Secretary of State out of moneys hereafter appropriated by the Inter-Colonial Council for Land Settlement purposes. The Government of the Colony may (subject to the consent of the Governor, and with the approval of the Secretary of State) come to an agreement with the Board for determining the functions of the Board at an earlier date.

The arrangement under which the Inter-Colonial Council has administered certain services common to the Transvaal and Orange River Colony was to be liable to be terminated on the motion of either Colony. This termination was carried out (see under Railways).

For the Act of Union, 1909, under South Africa.
Customs Union.

On 23rd March, 1903, a Customs Agreement was signed, under which the Transvaal and Southern Rhodesia entered the Customs Union, the result being that a common tariff was established for all the South African Colonies. All transit dues were abolished, and considerable reductions were made in through railway rates. The list of South African products which are carried over the railways at preferential rates—this constituting a second line of Protection—was reduced from 110 to 58 articles. A rebate is granted on articles manufactured in the United Kingdom of 2½% of the duty in certain cases and of the whole duty in those cases where it is 2½% ad valorem (ironmongery, etc.); a similar rebate may be made to any British colony giving equivalent reciprocal privileges to the Union. This Union was superseded by a new Agreement in 1906, which provided for a general increase in the Customs duties. The Agreement maintained the principle of preference for imports from the United Kingdom and reciprocating Colonies, a rebate equal to the increase in the duties being granted on such imports.

Local Government.

Municipal Government was established in the principal towns of the Colony by Ordinances enacted in 1903. These Ordinances have been extended and amended during the years 1904-1909 inclusive, and delegate to the local authorities very extensive powers. The Central Government retains some measure of control, limited however to powers of audit and surcharge, also approval of loan proposals, local improvement schemes and the alienation of municipal property. Thirty-six municipalities have been established, and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made.

The basis of the municipal franchise is ownership of ratable property of the assessed value of £100, or the occupation of ratable property of the assessed value of £300, or of premises of the gross annual value of £24, but this franchise is not extended to aliens or to coloured British subjects.

The election of councillors of the various municipalities is by ballot, and in all the larger towns the procedure followed is based on the lines prescribed for municipal elections by the English Acts of Parliament. In the municipalities of Pretoria and Johannesburg the principal of proportional representation has been applied to the elections of councillors by Act No. 23 of 1909, the system used being commonly known as that of the "single transferable vote."

Legislation as enacted in 1905 and 1906 provides for the creation of Health Committees, where the density of population makes it necessary in semi-urban areas for sanitary measures to be enforced. Five of these committees have been established.

The Commission appointed in June, 1904, to enquire into the financial relations between the Central Government and Municipal Authorities has completed an exhaustive survey of the important subjects which were referred for its consideration and effect has already been given by Responsible Government to the majority of this Commission's recommendations.

There is no system of local government for rural districts such as the system of Divisional Councils which obtains in other British South African Colonies. Magistrates deal administratively with a number of matters which in other Colonies are administered by bodies popularly elected. Since the grant of Responsible Government, however, local Boards have been created to assist Government in administering education matters, maintenance of roads, regulation of water in public streams and prevention of cattle disease. The creation of field cornets who assist the magistrates in the administration of laws in the magisterial districts is also a new feature introduced by Responsible Government in the local administration of the country districts.

Railways.

The Central South African Railways include the lines of the late Netherlands South African Railway, the late Orange Free State Government Railways, and the line known as the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway, which formerly belonged to a London company. On the 31st August, 1909, the length of open lines in the Transvaal and Orange River Colonies was 2,568 miles, and the construction of a further 65 miles (from Belfast to Lydenburg) was nearing completion.

At the present time the railway mileage opened and in working is already considerably more than double that open in 1898, the year before the war, while the construction of a further 508 miles of new line was recently sanctioned by Parliament.

The first-class single fare from Cape Town to Pretoria is 9½s. 7½d., and from Cape Town to Johannesburg 9½s. 0½d., with free conveyance of 100 lbs. personal luggage; the second-class fares from Cape Town to Pretoria and Johannesburg are 6½s. 1½d. and 6½s. 1½d. respectively, with a free allowance of 75 lbs. luggage.

The administration of the railways in the two Colonies is under the control of a Board composed of representatives of both the Transvaal and Orange River Colony Ministries and Parliaments.

The accounts of the Colony begin practically with the year 1902-3, and relate to annual periods between the 1st July and 30th June.

The loan of £35,000,000 raised in the year 1903, under a guarantee from the Imperial Government and under the authority of the Transvaal Guaranteed Loan Ordinance 1903, bearing interest at the rate of 3% per annum and with a sinking fund of 1% per annum, has been allocated in terms of the Transvaal Inter-Colonial Conventions Ratification Act, 1908, between the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony in the following manner:

Transvaal £27,300,000
Orange River Colony 7,700,000
£35,000,000

The Transvaal portion has again been divided as between the Transvaal Government and the Central South African Railways Administration into two portions, namely, 12,795,824l. and 14,504,176l.

| 1909 (January to June) | 3,640,429 | 15,463,560 |

The total output of the Transvaal from 1884 to June, 1909, was valued at 242,515,005L. Almost the whole production is from reef, the alluvial gold being inconsiderable in amount.

In 1897 the average number of persons employed by gold mines was 9,530 whites and 69,127 natives. These numbers rose to 12,000 and 107,000 just before the war in 1899, but then fell to about 10,000 and 45,000 in December, 1902. In June, 1909, the whites numbered 21,620 and the natives 175,865. The wages in June, 1909 were from about 10s. per shift for skilled white workmen (contractors earning up to 45s. per shift) and 4s. monthly for natives; the latter are also provided with housing and food.

Chinese labourers were imported under an Ordinance (17 of 1904) passed in February, 1904. At the end of 1905 the further issue of licences for the importation of these labourers was arrested by His Majesty's Government, and subsequently, on the promulgation of the Transvaal Letters Patent, provision was made for the repatriation of all Chinese labourers on the expiration of their contracts. The first batch of Chinese to be repatriated in terms of this condition left the country at the end of June, 1907. The month of January, 1907, shows the highest number (viz., 53,866) of Chinese in the employ of mines, whilst in June, 1909, there were 7,317 Chinese.

During the year ended 30th June, 1909, the Transvaal produced copper ore value 50,257L; tin ore, 153,155L; lead, 25,268L; lime, 61,965L; other base minerals, 36,905L; and the silver contained in the gold bullion exported and base metal ores was valued at 86,825L.

The total value of the diamonds produced in the Transvaal since the war is as follows:

| Year | £ |
|------|---|
| 1901-2 | 1,199 |
| 1902-3 | 46,358 |
| 1903-4 | 685,720 |
| 1904-5 | 1,198,530 |
| 1905-6 | 968,229 |
| 1906-7 | 2,263,511 |
| 1907-8 | 1,879,551 |
| 1908-9 | 1,295,296 |

The Premier (Transvaal) Diamond Mining Company accounts for almost the whole of the above production, and still maintains its position as one of the largest producers of the world.

The output of coal for the year ended 30th June, 1908, was 2,892,214 tons, value 778,659L.

The output of coal for the year ended 30th June, 1909, was 3,312,413 tons, value 851,150L.
