ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and
St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from Kingstown.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the southwestern extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of about 4,000 souls. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1908, 32 vessels, of 700 tons.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Chateaubelair on the north-west. The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufrière," or volcano, hitherto celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rises to about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea. After remaining dormant for a period of ninety years, it broke into violent eruption again on May 7th, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont Pelée in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central angle to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district, which formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates, suffered very severely from the eruptions of 1902-03. The next highest point after the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. St. Lucia and Barbados also suffered from this storm, but in lesser degree.

Climate

In the dry season, December to June, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy, and fever is almost unknown. The nights are cool all the year round. The average rainfall for the last 15 years is 104.01 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during 1908-9 was 88° F. and the lowest 62° F., the mean monthly temperature being 77.1° F. in the shade. The prevailing wind is N.E.

Industry and Communications.

Sugar, rum, cocoa, and excellent arrowroot are produced. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention, and cotton is now extensively planted, for the ginning of which a Government factory has been erected. Most of the sugar and all the arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivable land is owned by a few individuals; portions of Crownlands, which hitherto remained uncultivated, are in process of alienation to peasant proprietors, and several estates have recently been purchased by the Government with the aid of an Imperial grant, and are being allotted to the same class of settlers. The forests produce excellent woods. There are 56 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne.

The port of Kingstown is visited by the Royal Mail and the Canadian Mail Steamers fortnightly; the steamers of the Quebec Steamship Company, an American Line, also call.

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 7 branch exchanges, with about 50 connections and some 150 miles of line.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £2,625.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on conditions of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1795 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.
The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of East Indian Coolie labourers in 1861. The indentures of these immigrants have expired, and most of them have returned to India. Some, however, have made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution.**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony, and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. The Legislative Council now consists of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the colony is the sole Judge of this court.

There were, at the time of the annual inspection in 1909, 27 schools, with 4,590 children on the rolls, and an average attendance of 2,267. There is also a government agricultural school, opened in 1900.

The Government expenditure on education in 1907-8 was £1,428l.

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 121 depositors, with £14,313l. deposited, at 1st December, 1908. On 1st July, 1900, branches of the bank were opened at Georgetown and hateau Belair.
