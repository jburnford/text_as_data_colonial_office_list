ST. HELENA.

Situation, Area, &c.

St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of Africa, in 15° 56' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 104 miles long and 63 broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 17 days, and from Capetown, 6 days.

A census taken in May, 1901, showed a population of 9,850, of whom 4,650 were Boer prisoners of war, and 1,428 members of the garrison. The inhabitants numbered 3,342.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of 1,439. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 84°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall in 1908 was 39 inches in the country. The island is very healthy, the average death-rate for the three years ended 1906 having been only 13.7 per 1,000, including seamen landed in the island seriously ill. The death-rate for 1908 was 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants.

History.

St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch held it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1665 it was seized by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they seized it, to be driven out finally in May, by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A new charter was issued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 3 schools, having 290 scholars. There are also 6 endowed and private day schools, three of which are aided by Government, having 356 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 11 of 1903, and fees of 1d. a week per child are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1908 were 800l. and 790l.

Industry.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818 a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre (phormium). The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre, though, under present conditions of working, nine tons of phormium leaves give one ton of fibre and a quarter ton of tow. The industry has now been re-started with the help of a grant from the Home Exchequer, and it is hoped that this will do much to relieve the lack of employment and consequent distress resulting from the recent withdrawal of the Imperial Garrison.
There are two fibre mills in the island, one being a Government institution, opened in December, 1907.

Phormium fibre exported during 1908:

| Year | Fibre | Tow. |
|------|-------|------|
| Government Mill | 111 tons | 33 tons |
| Private | ... | ... |

Value, £3,557.

There is said to be a field for capital in the preparation of the fibre from the *Furcraea gigantea*, an aloe which grows wild all over the island. Forty tons of aloe leaves yield one ton of fibre.

A lace-making industry was established in August, 1907, with the help of a grant from Imperial funds. It is now controlled by the Colonial Government.

Trade depends upon the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress, and has greatly diminished in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal. The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war was, in 1908, 53. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are phormium fibre and lace-making, fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being potatoes.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1908—£17,532.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at from £1 to 1 per cent.

**Means of Communication.**

Steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence at the same interval, and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 16 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India, and certain Colonies* is 1d. per oz.; to other parts of the world 2½d. per oz. There is no internal post, but there are 81½ miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of £700. The new cable from the Cape (which is being worked by the Eastern Telegraph Company with a staff of 30, including a Superintendent) reached St. Helena at the end of 1899, and was carried forward to Ascension by February, 1900. It is completed to St. Vincent.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of His Majesty in Council.
