BRITISH HONDURAS.

Situation and Area.

British Honduras is a Colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the rapids of Gracias a Dios on the River Saratoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier, on the south by Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18°29' and 15°54' N. latitude and 89°10' and 87°50' W. longitude.

The area of the Colony is 7,562 square miles, about the size of Wales, including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George's, English, Turneffe and other Cays, 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. It is estimated that about 80 square miles are under cultivation.

History.

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers who were attracted by the fine timber (logwood).
and mahogany) which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were long at St. George's Cay. The name of the present chief town and of the River Belize is alleged to be a corruption of the name of the buccaneer Wallis, who was driven from Hispaniola in that year, and who is said to have been the leader of the settlers.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito coast, in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers, and their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection, and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain, and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Rustan, and at Black River on the mainland. Rustan was abandoned in 1749, but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements. By the treaty of Paris in 1763 it was agreed to abandon the settlements, and the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1789, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay," the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms; and treaty after treaty was concluded, which had little other effect than to stimulate the enterprise of the settlers by the recognition, thus step by step accorded, of the footing they had gained for themselves in Central America, without, in the first instance, any thought of territorial aggrandisement, but solely in pursuit of the industry in which their fortunes were embarked.

The Bay Islands were recognised as part of the Republic of Honduras in 1859.

The only subsequent events of external significance which need here be noticed, are the definition, as above, of the boundaries of the Colony (of which a survey has been partially executed); and the frequent border troubles, connected with the revolt in 1849 of the Indian population of Yucatan against the Spanish inhabitants, the result of which was that the Indians were in possession of the country to a considerable distance north of the Hondo until 1901, when the Mexicans subjugated them. Occasional incursions into the Colony were made from time to time by the Indians, the last being in 1872, by the Icaiche tribe on the N.W. frontier.

**Constitution.**

The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1756 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790-1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1839 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted, consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on the 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, and a Legislative Council substituted therefor, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial, members, with the Lieutenant-Governor as President. By Ordinance 14 of 1892, the Council now consists of three official and five unofficial members. On the 31st October, 1884, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica. These were renewed by Letters Patent proclaimed on the 10th September, 1909.

The English Common Law extends to the Colony as far as local circumstances render such extension suitable, and subject to modification by Colonial ordinances. By Ordinance No. 2 of 1884, provision was made for the revision, consolidation and publication of the laws of the Colony, and such laws having been revised and consolidated into one volume, they were brought into operation by Ordinance No. 7 of 1888, and are known as "The Consolidated Laws of British Honduras"; appeals lie to the Privy Council, and by 44 and 45 Vict., cap. 36, 16, the Supreme Court of Jamaica.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, and six members, three of whom are ex officio, the other three appointed members.

For administrative purposes the Colony is divided into six districts—Belize, which includes the capital at the mouth of the river of the same name; the Corosol district; the Orange Walk district; the Cayo district; the Stann Creek district; and the Toledo district, the main station of which is Punta Gorda, comprising the extreme south of the Colony.

**General Description.**

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached. The characteristic soils of the Colony are known as Cahoon ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), the Pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass), and Broken ridge (intermediate between these two). Besides these there are swamp, savannah, and mountain.

The chief rivers are in the north of the Colony, and run in a north-easterly direction, the Belize reaching the sea on the east, and the Hondo and the New River on the north.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscomb Mountains a height of some 4,000 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open
undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pasturage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. The soil generally was rich, but a few rugged spots were encountered. Some fine gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered, and other indications of minerals were noticed.

In 1888 Governor Sir R. Goldsworthy, with an exploring party, ascended the Cockscomb Mountains.

Industry.

The chief industry is wood-cutting, now over 200 years old. 14,398,422 superficial feet of mahogany, 736,639 superficial feet of cedar, and 5,774 tons of logwood were exported in 1908. The next in importance is fruit, the exports in 1908 having been 471,600 bunches bananas, 939,000 (number) plantains, and 5,072,150 cocoanuts. Specie to the amount of $26,140 was exported in 1908. The Colony also exported 1,790,865 lbs. sapodilla gum, 27,862 lbs. of rubber, and sponges and tortoiseshell.

Alternating with stretches of sandy plain, yielding pine trees, are large areas of very rich land, on which, in addition to mahogany and many beautiful hard woods of which little or no use is made, the cahoon palm and vanilla orchid are most noticeable by reason of their abundance and the luxuriance with which they grow. The Colony has not yet been exploited by the economic botanist, otherwise these rich oil-bearing nuts and vanilla would certainly have been turned to profitable account instead of being allowed to go to waste. There is a wide field for the colonist with a little capital and a stock of perseverance and common sense, as this virgin forest land is being offered for sale at a dollar an acre.

A contract was signed in September, 1903, for the sale of the pine trees on Crown land to Mr. B. Chipley, a citizen of the United States, at a price of 1 cent per tree. It is anticipated that the opening up of the interior of the Colony, which will be necessary for the purposes of this contract, will be of great benefit to trade.

Belize is a port of registry, and had registered, on 31st December, 1908, 292 vessels, of 7,598 aggregate tonnage.

The imports consist mainly of cotton goods and hardware, malt liquors, spirits, refined sugar, tea, tobacco, wines, provisions, and specie. The commercial intercourse is mainly with the United States and Great Britain.

Communications.

There are no completed railways in the Colony, although one is now in course of construction, and the easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is regular communication twice a week by mail steamers with New Orleans and Puerto Cortez; and every month with Liverpool and Colon. The usual length of the journey between England and British Honduras is 16 days, via the United States. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Payo Obispo, in Yucatan, only about half an hour's sail from Consejo, which is connected with Belize by telephone; but the best way to send telegrams is via New Orleans, U.S.A.

A land line has been constructed from Belize to the Hondo, and is being carried across the river to connect with the Mexican telegraph system.

A telegraph and telephone line has also been constructed from Belize to the most southerly town of Punta Gorda.

Surveys have been made with a view to the construction of a trans-colonial railway to develop the interior, and a railway has now been started to lead, from the town of Stann Creek, 25 miles inland, the first section of which was opened towards the end of 1908, and the second section in March, 1909.

Money Order Offices are established at Belize, Corosol, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda, and The Cayo.

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 98°, the minimum 50°. The dew point in Belize, a seaport, is relatively high. Sea breezes prevail for the greater part of the year. The average rainfall during the past twenty years has been 81-48 inches per annum. From the middle of February to the middle of May is the dry season. For the rest of the year there is rain to some extent during every month, the heaviest rainfall being in the months of September, October and November, during which months about one-third of the total rain occurs.

Currency and Banking.

Up to the 14th October, 1894, the coins in circulation were principally South and Central and American silver dollars; there was no paper currency. The standard of value was the Guatemalan dollar, and Chilian and Peruvian silver coins were also current and legal tender, as well as a colonial currency of one-cent pieces, at fixed ratings with the Guatemalan dollar. By Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, the currency has been established on a gold basis, the United States gold dollar being adopted as the standard coin. Gold coins of the United States Mint are legal tender for the amounts of their respective denominations in standard dollars; also the British sovereign and half-sovereign for the amounts of $4.867 and $2.433 respectively. There is a local

* See end of Introduction. A reduced rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on 1st Jan., 1899.
subsidiary currency of 50 cent, 25 cent, 10 cent, and 5 cent silver pieces, and a Government note issue of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 and 100 dollars; a nickel bronze 5 cent piece and a bronze cent piece are also current. The limit of the legal tender in silver is fixed at $10, and in nickel or bronze at 50 cents. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corosol, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda, and the Cayo), had, on 31st March, 1909, $71,348.

On the 14th January, 1903, The Bank of British Honduras, Ltd., commenced business with a fully paid up capital of $50,000. Since then the capital has been increased to $100,000, of which $75,000 has been issued. It is a local institution, with a local directorate, registered under Chapter 87 of the Consolidated Laws. It is a bank of deposit and discount, but not of circulation. Its Reserve Fund is now $55,000.

Education.

The schools, both Secondary and Primary, are, with one or two exceptions, denominational. With few exceptions, all Primary schools are inspected and aided by the Colonial Government. Forty-two received aid in 1908, to the extent of $16,629.25, with 4,385 scholars on the roll, and 3,130 average attendance. The total cost of Primary education for the year was $28,862.

The total number of pupils on the roll in all the schools was about 4,779, with an average attendance of 3,474.

Population.

The population on the 31st March, 1909, based on the census of 1901, was:

| District          | Population |
|-------------------|------------|
| Belize District   | 16,047     |
| Corosol District  | 6,303      |

| Stann Creek District | 4,355    |
| Toledo District   | 5,404      |
| Cayo District     | 3,011      |
| **Total**         | **43,270** |

About 400 are Europeans, and 200 White Americans. Of European descent there are about 2,000.

Population of towns for 1909: Belize, 10,825; Corosol, 1,748; Orange Walk, 1,328; Stann Creek, 2,691; Mullins River, 163; Punta Gorda, 754; Monkey River, 436; The Cayo, 497. These have local boards, with, in 1908-9, an aggregate revenue of $41,415, and an expenditure of $47,899.

DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba) were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabaska, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, § 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabaska were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,650 square miles.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 87 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is now 221; 86 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 18 Nova Scotia, 13 New Brunswick, 10 Manitoba, 7 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 7 Alberta, 10 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $2,500 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $2,500 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, and the franchise is regulated by the several Provincial Legislatures, which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from November to May.
paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of peace, &c.
In Council 18th December, territory was subdivided of Ungava, Franklin, which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from November to May.
For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory and the Arctic Islands) is very thinly inhabited, and is governed by a Commissioner and a Council of four appointed by the Governor in Council at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, as ascertained by the census of 1861, and in the case of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, by each subsequent decennial census until the population of each of these two Provinces amounted to 400,000. Each Province also received an annual allowance for Government.

The Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, whose public debts were less, proportionally, at the Union than that of the old Province of Canada became entitled to receive an interest allowance, payable half-yearly, on the difference between their respective debts and certain stipulated amounts.

The annual subsidies granted to the several provinces have been revised by Imperial enactment (1907), and are now as follows:

(a) A fixed grant according to population:

| Where population is— | $ |
|---------------------|---|
| Under 150,000       | 100,000 |
| 150,000, but does not exceed 200,000 | 150,000 |
| 200,000             | 400,000 |
| 400,000             | 800,000 |
| 800,000             | 1,500,000 |
| over 1,500,000      | 240,000 |

(b) A grant at the rate of 80 cents per head of the population of the province up to 2,500,000, and at the rate of 60 cents per head of so much of the population as exceeds that number.

(c) An additional grant of $100,000 yearly to the province of British Columbia for a period of ten years.

In lieu of public lands in Alberta and Saskatchewan, which the Dominion retains, each province receives until its population reaches 400,000, an annual sum of $375,000, payable half-yearly; thereafter until the population reaches 800,000, an annual sum of $562,500; thereafter until the population reaches 1,200,000, $750,000; thereafter the sum payable shall be $1,125,000.

Each of these two provinces, inasmuch as they were not in debt at the time (1906) of their statutory creation, are entitled to be paid half-yearly, in advance, an annual sum of $405,375.

As an additional allowance in lieu of public lands, each of these provinces became entitled to an annual allowance of $93,750 for five years to provide for the construction of necessary public buildings.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Provision was made for the construction of a line of railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, and thence to the Pacific Ocean, under the name of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The first contracts for building were let in August, 1905.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises:

(a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 square miles; (b) villages with a population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute (d) the county municipality; (e) cities are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 15,000. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councillors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.
Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except a portion of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,745,674 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion comprise a little over 1,000,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

| **Total**         | 4,324,810 | 4,833,239 | 5,371,315 |

About 1,650,000 of the people are of French extraction, over one million three hundred thousand of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 94,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 34,000 half-breeds. They are under the supervision of Government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. According to the census of 1901 there were 17,299 Chinese in Canada, most of whom are in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

The population of the North-West Provinces, according to a census taken on the 24th June, 1906, was as follows:

- Alberta: 185,412
- Saskatchewan: 257,763
- Manitoba: 365,688

The number of immigrants arrived during the year ended 30th June, 1908, was 204,071, and in 1909, 152,071.

Manufacturing and Industry.

Manufacturing is carried on somewhat extensively. The total capital employed in 1906 in factories having more than five hands was $833,916,155; the number of employes, 383,920; the wages paid $162,175,578 a year, and the annual product $706,446,578. The annual product of all mechanical industries, irrespective of number of hands employed, was $718,362,603, equal to 124.81 per head of the population.

Industry.

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. "Homesteads" of 160 acres can be obtained without any payment, and the process of settlement on the land in the west is rapidly going on; 45 per cent. of the population is engaged in agriculture, and 30,424 "homesteads" were granted in 1908, covering an area of 4,867,840 acres. In 1907 there were 3,516 butter and cheese factories and 7 factories producing condensed milk and cream. The value of land, buildings and plant is $8,564,440 and of working capital $1,641,787. The number of persons employed in factories during the year was 6,586, and the amount paid for salaries and wages was $1,811,875. The quantity of butter made in factories during the year was 46,930,234 lbs., with a value of $10,949,062; the quantity of cheese made was 204,788,583 lbs., with a value of $23,597,639; and the quantity of condensed milk and cream made was 12,176,135 lbs., with a value including all products of condenseries of $910,842. The value of all dairy products at factories was $35,457,543 in 1907, $33,257,674 in 1905, and $29,731,922 in 1900. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Manufactures have been very considerably developed, the output being, in the year 1901, $106,08, and in 1905 $124.81 per head of the population. In 1908 the quantity of wood, blocks and other, for pulp exported was 901,861 cords, valued at $4,655,371; and the quantity and value of wood pulp exported was 4,811,163 cwts., valued at $4,637,802. The principal minerals produced in 1908 were coal $25,567,238; gold $9,559,274; silver $11,667,197; copper $8,500,885; nickel $8,231,538; asbestos $2,547,507; lead $1,920,487; and cement $3,709,063. The total production of minerals was $87,323,849. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and, besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments. The principal imports are textile manufactures, coal, hardware, tea, sugar, raw cotton, hides, and tobacco.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1896 was as follows:

| Year | Yield |
|------|-------|
| 1898 | 19,667,126 |
| 1899 | 21,891,706 |
| 1900 | 21,557,639 |
| 1901 | 26,737,154 |
| 1902 | 21,959,433 |
| 1903 | 23,101,878 |
| 1904 | 23,516,439 |
| 1905 | 29,479,662 |
| 1906 | 26,279,486 |
| 1907 | 25,499,349 |

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is about 83,000.

The arrivals and clearances were, in the year 1908, a total tonnage of 39,575,031 engaged in outside trade, and 50,029,836 tons engaged in coasting trade.

The number of steamers and sailing vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1908, was 7,602, with a net tonnage of 702,324. Of this number 3,084 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 483,031. The number of seamen employed was over 132,000.

In 1908 the number of light stations, lightships and fog-alarm stations was 965, and lights shown 1,162; the number of steam whistles, fog horns, bells and guns, 214; the number of gas buoys, whistling buoys and bell buoys, 339; the number of light keepers and engineers of fog-alarms, with masters of lightships, was 914.

Railways.

The length of steam railways in operation in the Dominion on 30th June, 1908, was 22,966 miles. The total capital invested amounted to $1,239,761,013 on 30th June, 1908. The total quantity of goods carried in the year 1908 amounted to 63,071,167 tons. The number of passengers was 34,044,992, and the distance travelled by trains was 78,637,526 miles. The total receipts were $146,918,314, and working expenses $107,304,143.

The Dominion Government owns and maintains 1,719 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $94,826,259. The working expenses in 1908 were $9,757,533, and the receipts, $9,248,917.

There are 52 Electric Railways in Canada. These ran 56,964,881 car miles, and carried 299,093,309 passengers, or five passengers per mile run. The working expenses in 1908 were $8,695,830, and the receipts $14,007,049.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, viz Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and a monthly mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama, which has been subsidised by the Imperial and Dominion Government to the extent of $219,000, has been established. Of this amount Canada pays $121,667. The Canadian Pacific Railway has now 11,356 miles of railway. The number of miles operated by the Canadian Northern Railway during the year ended June 30th, 1908, was 3,648 miles.

Construction on the new transcontinental line from Moncton, N.B., to Prince Rupert, B.C., on the Pacific Coast, is being proceeded with vigourously. The total length of that portion of the line, viz, from Moncton to Winnipeg, which is being built by the Dominion Government, is approximately 1,804.84 miles.

The length of the western portion of the line, viz, from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, which is projected by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company, will be approximately 1,754 miles, in addition to the Lake Superior branch of 200 miles in length, extending from Fort William
on Lake Superior to Lake Superior Junction on the main line of the eastern section (or Transcontinental Railway). Of this total 1,216 miles are at present under actual construction, including the entire Lake Superior branch and the main line between Winnipeg and Wolf Creek, and 100 miles from Prince Rupert easterly. During the year 1908 the expenditure on labour, material, etc., was about $11,360,925.

Telegraphs.

There are 33,222 miles of telegraph line, and 123,080 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 7,270, including 342 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 6,138,766 messages were sent in 1908 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 2,759, being one to every 2,604 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. The telephone is very generally used. The Select Committee of the House of Commons, in April, 1905, reported that there were 81 telephone companies in Canada. Of these, 46 reported to the Statistical Office. Compilation of the reports showed that the 46 had 94,820 sets of instruments; 214,405 miles of wire, and nearly 291,000,000 connections.

There were, in 1908, 403 electric light companies in Canada, having 19,838 arc lamps and 2,831,826 incandescent lights. Every Province of the Dominion is supplied with the electric light.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. From Lake Superior to the sea there is water passage nowhere less than 14 feet deep. The total length of canals proper open is 262½ miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts for the year 1908 were $144,882, and the working expenses, including repairs, $885,300. Over one hundred and nineteen million dollars have been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault St. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not yet been reimposed.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills, $4.86 being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

The Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint was established in pursuance of The Ottawa Mint Act, 1901 (1 Edw. VII., c. 4), under which an annual sum not exceeding $75,000 is payable to the Imperial Treasury for the purpose of defraying the salaries of officials and other expenses of the Mint, the fees and all sums received being retained by Canada.

The Mint issues gold, silver and copper coins for circulation in Canada, and sovereigns and half-sovereigns coined are legal tender in every country under the British flag.

The Savings Banks, under the charge of the Government, on March 31st, 1908, had $62,581,145 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit $28,574,954. In addition all the 31 chartered banks have savings banks branches, but the returns to the Government do not specify the amounts on deposits in these branches.

The following banks are established in Canada, on 30th June, 1909:

**Ontario—(Headquarters).**

Bank of Toronto. Bank of Hamilton.
Dominion Bank. Western Bank.
Standard Bank. Traders' Bank.

These banks had, on 1st January, 1909, about 2,000 branches, distributed throughout the Dominion.

The paid-up banking capital has more than doubled since 1870. In June of that year it was $32,050,597, and in June, 1909, it was $97,436,424. The bank note circulation on 30th June, 1909, was $70,170,491. In 1877 they held $69,763,668 of deposits, and, on June 30th, 1909, they held $773,590,935. In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1890 amounted to $15,501,360, and in 1908 to $68,602,944. The Dominion Government by statute must always hold, as security for the redemption of Dominion notes issued and outstanding up to and including thirty million dollars, an amount in gold or in gold and guaranteed securities of Canada equal to not less than 25 per cent. of the amount of such notes, the gold held to be not less than 15 per cent. of the amount. To secure issue of notes in excess of thirty millions it must hold dollar in gold for dollar in notes. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government.

* Are being wound up.
† Went into liquidation April 28th, 1908.
Post Office.

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended March 31st, 1908, was 396,011,000, of postcards 40,664,000. The number of offices was 11,823. The gross revenue for the year ended March 31st, 1908, was $9,483,166, and the gross expenditure $6,005,930.

The mail communication with Great Britain is weekly via the Canadian ports of Quebec and Halifax, and semi-weekly via New York. With the West Indies there is a fortnightly mail service via Halifax, and from three to four trips per week via United States ports. There is a through service twice a day across the continent from Halifax on the Atlantic to Vancouver on the Pacific coast by the Canadian Pacific and Intercolonial Railways, a monthly direct steam service with Australia (with the exception of Western Australia) via Vancouver. With Japan and China there is a direct connection by steamer from Vancouver once every three weeks from April to September inclusive, and once every four weeks during the rest of the year.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), authorising the Crown to issue a proclamation dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1837-8. The risings in both Provinces were caused by Governor after Governor attempting to rule by the aid of Executive Councils not possessing the confidence of the Provincial Assemblies. The rebels were suppressed with very little difficulty. Afterwards the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 36, and the Legislative Bodies
of the united Provinces were consolidated: the new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. Subsequently, by 17 & 18 Vict. c. 118, the Canadian Legislature was empowered to alter the Constitution of the Legislative Council. This power was utilised in 1856 by an Act of Canada which made half of the Legislative Council elective for terms of eight years. This modification was an important one, for it was because of the dissatisfaction caused by the behaviour of the elected Councillors that, on the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, the new Senate was made appointive. The new House of Assembly, created in 1840, consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1859. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1864 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in Council, advised by five or more Cabinet Ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 106 members; Quebec, 74 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $6 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $1,000. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

**Industry.**

The industrial wealth of Ontario is derived, primarily, from its farms, its forests, mines and fisheries; secondarily, from its manufactures. In 1907, the value of the farm land, buildings, implements and live stock of the province is $1,222,000,000. There are over 24,000,000 acres of improved farm land, about half the acreage being under cultivation. The farms average 115 acres in extent, of which 81% are owned by the occupants. The average value of farm products per acre is greater than in any other province, and the total annual production is placed at $200,000,000. Dairying and the breeding and feeding of live stock are combined with general farming. The value of the cheese factory output is about $18,500,000 annually. The total dairy output is valued at $35,000,000, the live stock output at $60,000,000.

All the fruits usually grown in the temperate zone may be produced in Ontario, not only successfully, but in a very high degree of excellence. Apples constitute the principal crop, but tender fruits such as peaches, pears, plums and grapes are very extensively grown in the Niagara peninsula. The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables is a well established industry. From 700,000 to 1,000,000 barrels of apples are exported annually, chiefly to Great Britain.

The manufacturing industries of the province have undergone great expansion of recent years, and represent 47 per cent. of the total capital employed in manufacturing in Canada. The total output for 1905 was valued at $281,000,000.

The value of the output of the mines and mineral industries of Ontario in 1907 was $25,019,373.

**Education.**

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public and separate) and high schools, of which there are 6,418, with 496,750 scholars in 1907. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and four theological colleges are also affiliated, and one university is confederated. There are also four denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges for boys and girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics' institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1908, 6,511 schools, with 360,512 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

The following table gives some information respecting the public, high, and superior schools in Canada, also the amount expended for education:—

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 459,574.

History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I. in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the last census 40,832. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. A dry dock is also situate at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Digby, Kentville, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney (in Cape Breton), Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney, and this city is developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the year ended 30th September, 1908, is as follows:

| Mineral       | Quantity |
|---------------|----------|
| Gold          | 11,990 ozs. |
| Iron ore      | 902,475 tons |
| Coal raised   | 6,299,282 ,, |
| Gypsum        | 242,535 ,, |
| Limestone     | 484,685 ,, |

There are large deposits of copper and other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. The value of the catch of fish in 1903 was $7,841,602. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent. England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and the establishment of a plant for the construction of steel ships is proposed, and will probably be proceeded with in the near future; large bonuses are offered to encourage the establishment of such plant.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 18 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every five years. The Members are paid $500 sessional indemnity.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1907 there were 2,465 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 100,007 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

Under "The Technical Education Act," of 1907, local technical schools have been established in
all the larger industrial centres in order to produce a class of educated, skilled workmen for the various manufacturing industries. A central institution called the "Nova Scotia Technical College" has been established at Halifax, where instruction of a college grade is provided in mining, civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering. The principal of this college is the Director of Technical Education.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,177 square miles, or about 17,393,410 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 1st July, 1901, was 331,120.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 10° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 75 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, from which excellent salt is manufactured, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 7,117), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 40,711). Other towns are Moncton (9,026), Chatham (4,868), Woodstock (2,984), and St. Stephen (2,840).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 13 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 46 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were 1,828 schools, with 66,383 scholars in attendance in 1908.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville and Monramcook.

By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-97° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-53° N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 73,956 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 62,260, which had grown to 154,442 in 1891, and 365,688 in 1906.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St.
Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

**History.**

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a Provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871, the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence to two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

**Description.**

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced. "Manitoba No. 1 Hard," because of its superior milling qualities is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle and dairy products. In 1907 there were over 60,000 farmers in the province, who had in crop 4,912,435 acres, consisting as follows:

- Wheat ........................................... 2,850,640 acres.
- Oats .................................................. 1,316,632 "
- Barley .................................................. 658,441 "
- Flax, etc. ............................................... 74,701 "
- Potatoes ................................................ 29,963 "
- Roots .................................................... 13,592 "

The average yield of wheat per acre for ten years is 18·38 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Free grant lands are still available in several districts into which new railways are being projected. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $8 to $20 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is over 125,000. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Manitou, Deloraine, Dauphin, Souris, Virden, and St. Boniface.

Coal of the lignite variety is to be found in the Souris Valley. Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful. A sand suitable for glass is found in great quantities, and the industry is being developed.

Manufacturing industries are becoming numerous in Winnipeg and other centres of the Province.

**Railway Facilities.**

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.

In the year 1907 there were in the province of Manitoba over 4,500 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

**Climate.**

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to March), 53 inches.

**Constitution.**

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 10 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 41 members elected by manhood suffrage for 5 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $1,000 per session, and their travelling expenses.

**Education.**

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, all the previous School Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides "that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns, and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1908 there were 2,014 schools in operation, employing 2,526 teachers, of whom 598 were men, and 1,928 women.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), and the Manitoba Medical.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west
coast of North America, and comprises the terri-
tory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on
the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th
parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to
the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States,
and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average
breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of
coast line over 1,000 miles. The area (including
Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about
383,000 square miles, and the population, at the
census of 1891, was 98,173, and at that of 1901,
190,000.

History

British Columbia was constituted a Crown
colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration
consequent on the discovery of gold in that year.
Vancouver Island was leased to the Hudson's
Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown
colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British
Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and
on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the
Canadian Confederation, and is represented by
three members in the Senate, and seven in the
House of Commons of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by
a Lieutenant-Governor and legislative assembly of
42 members on the system of executive adminis-
tration known as a "responsible government."
The assembly is elected for four years, every male adult (British subjects) having resided six months in the province, duly registered, being entitled to vote.

Members receive $1,200 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

Description.

The white population is estimated at 260,000, and there are about 29,000 Indians, 17,000 Chinese, 16,000 Japanese, and 5,000 Hindus.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as “having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier.” The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream (Japan current) striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; the climate is for the most part drier, and the snowfall consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; in 1908 the imports amounted to $24,180,452, and the exports $23,941,187, a remarkable fact considering the number of the population. Exports consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver, copper and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon, halibut, herrings, whale products and oil), lumber, furs, skins, etc. The figures quoted show an increase in the total trade of the province of over nineteen million dollars in four years.

The mineral production of the Province to the end of 1907 amounts in value to $323,377,559, towards which sum coal has contributed $94,329,377.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up; this advance is clearly shown by the increase in the production since 1896, which is as follows: 1896, $4,267,179; 1902, $12,174,242. Total output of metalliferous mines for 1903, $16,964,064; 1904, $18,377,359; 1905, $22,461,325; 1906, $24,980,546; 1907, $26,882,560; 1908, $23,851,277. The decrease in 1908 was caused by a fall in prices of silver, copper, and lead. The tonnage of ore mined was greater than in 1907. There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.

The chief towns are Victoria (38,000) and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (7,000), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (12,000), Vancouver (85,000), Rossland (5,500), Trail (2,000), Nelson (7,000), Kaslo (2,000), Sandon (800), Kamloops (3,000), Fernie (3,500), Ashcroft, Revelstoke, and Golden are thriving places. Esquimalt, V.I., is a coaling station, and is the site of a large dry dock. Prince Rupert, the terminus of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, near the mouth of the Skeena River, is growing rapidly. Population 1,500 to 2,000.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction, composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in city school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether first, second or third class) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 16 high schools in the Province, employing 42 teachers. The number of schools in operation in 1907-1908 was 422, under 816 teachers, with an enrolment of 33,314 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

School districts are formed wherever there are 20 children between the ages of 6 and 16 years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64½° W. long. Its area is 1,356,120 acres, or 2,133 square miles; it is about 130 miles long, and its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastien Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census was 103,258.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories, tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,080) and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

Constitution.

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $160 per annum, and $12 for postage, besides travelling expenses.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is
also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

**Education.**

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 479 schools, with 18,012 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens. A new consolidated school is opened at Hillsboro' through the benevolence of Sir William McDonald, of Montreal, a native of the island. Another is opened at Tryon by the people themselves.

**Finance.**

The province has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest. There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a Road Tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

In 1888, election by popular vote was applied to the Assembly, 22 members being returned, representing the Territories included in the Provisional Districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, and Saskatchewan. In September, 1894, these districts were reorganised under a local ordinance and divided into 29 electoral districts, each returning one member to the Legislative Assembly, from among whom an Executive Committee, consisting of 4 members, was chosen to aid and advise the Lieutenant-Governor in connection with certain strictly defined matters relating to the government of the Territories. In 1898 the number of electoral districts was increased to 31, and in 1902 still further increased to 35. The Assembly elected its own Speaker. By an amendment to the Act in 1897 an Executive Council was authorised to assume office on 1st October, 1897, the members thereof being obliged to receive the approval of their constituents. This body advised the Lieutenant-Governor upon all matters appertaining to local administration in the Territories. The Territories have rapidly grown in wealth and importance in recent years, and immigration has been largely on the increase.

A portion of the Territories was organised in 1882 into four provisional districts, viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. The boundaries of these districts were defined as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52, on the west by longitude 111½, and on the south by latitude 49 (89,535 sq. miles).

Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Manitoba and Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 111½ (107,092 sq. miles).

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55 and on the west by British Columbia (106,100 sq. miles).

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 111½ and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia (104,500 sq. miles).

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, these four provisional districts were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South. Alberta has an area of 253,640 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,560 square miles.

Each of these provinces is now governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, with the assistance of an Executive Council. Each is represented in the Senate of Canada by 4 members, which number may after the next decennial census be increased to 6, and in the Dominion House of Commons there are 10 members for Saskatchewan and 7 for Alberta.

There is also in each a local Legislative Assembly consisting of 41 members in Saskatchewan, and in Alberta of 25. Further information will be found under the heading of Constitution of the Dominion, above.

The seat of Government of the province of Saskatchewan is at Regina, and of Alberta at Edmonton.

The population of Saskatchewan and Alberta was (1901) 91,279 and 73,022 respectively, which numbers had increased by June, 1906, to 257,763 and 185,412. Since the latter date these figures have, owing to immigration, more particularly from the United States, been greatly augmented.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply also to Saskatchewan and Alberta. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Alberta than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that there are over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.

NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES AND YUKON.

The North-West Territories now consist of the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and other territories not included in any province or within the boundaries of the Yukon district. The Territories are governed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, with a Council of not more than four members, also appointed by the Governor-General, and the Commissioner in Council is empowered to make ordinances for the Territories.

The boundaries of the Yukon district were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61-62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange River Colony and Natal. The Cape Colony, with the Transkei, contains an area of 276,995 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 26 to 36 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichabooe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesiwe country ("Mount Ayllif") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed. Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later.

Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape II years later.
from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the Haarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted.

An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000£ to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were: (1) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. (2) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. (3.) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in recent years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice is practically unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean annual temperature at the Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is 62°2 deg., the mean maximum being 70°8 deg., and the mean minimum 53°4 deg.; the average rainfall for the last 18 years is 26-33 inches. Aliwal North (4,330 ft. above sea level) shows a mean temperature of 59°2 deg., the mean maximum being 74°2 deg., and the mean minimum 44°1 deg.; the rainfall average of 18 years being 22°93 inches.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Cape Government Railways.

The railways of the Cape Colony were originally commenced by private enterprise at Cape Town, and when, in 1873, the lines were taken over by the Government, only 63 miles were open. New construction was then undertaken in the shape of three separate systems, starting from the principal seaports of the Colony, viz., Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London.

In 1885, 1,599 miles had been opened for traffic, and for a period of some three years there was a suspension of further work, though the necessity of making progress towards the establishing of through communication within the Colony, and
the securing of the trade of the inland States to the north of the Colony was constantly kept in view.

Consequently, on the discovery of the Gold Fields in the Transvaal abnormal development in railway construction ensued, and the same is now, and has been, observable in respect to the rapid extension of the railways in Rhodesia.

On December, 31st, 1908, the Cape Government railways consisted of 3,265 miles of open line, divided into three systems, known as Western, Midland, and Eastern, and there were in addition 492 miles of privately owned railways.

The following statement shows particulars of the Government and other railways in the Cape Colony, October (1909):

| Government | Private |
|------------|---------|
| Miles      | Miles   |

The Western Main Line extends from Cape Town to Kimberley (647 miles—the centre of the Diamond Mining Industry) and Vryburg.

From Vryburg, a line of railway owned by the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, extends to Bulawayo, the Victoria Falls, and on to Brokenhill. The section of this line from Vryburg to Bulawayo, exclusive, is worked for the Company by the Cape Government. North of Bulawayo, the Company's lines are worked by the Beira and Mashonaland Railway Company. The section from Vryburg to Ramatlabama is within the Cape Colony.

The following lines leave the Western Main Line:

- Cape Town (Adderley Street) to Sea Point
- Craig's Crossing (11 miles from Cape Town) to Milnerton, owned by the Milnerton Estates, Limited, and worked by the Government on Company's account
- Salt River (24 miles from Cape Town) to Wynberg and Simon's Town
- Maitland (4 miles from Cape Town) to Ottery

This line was purchased from the Cape Flats and Suburban Syndicate, Limited, in August, 1908.

Bellville (13 miles from Cape Town) to Stellenbosch (loop line), returning to main line at Mulder's Vlei. From Eerste River on this loop there is a branch to Sir Lowry Pass and Caledon.

From Van der Stel on the Caledon line, to Somerset Strand.

The Government is indemnified for any loss on working this line, and interest on capital, for 10 years from 16-12-06.

Kraaifontein (19 miles from Cape Town) to Malmesbury and Eendekuil.

From Kalabas Kraal on this branch there is a 2-ft. gauge line to Hopefield.

Paarl (36 miles from Cape Town) to French Hoek.

Worcester (109 miles from Cape Town) to Fore Bay (4½ from Mossel Bay).

This is a private line, owned and worked by the New Cape Central Railway, Limited.

Hutchinson (419 miles from Cape Town) to Carnarvon.

De Aar (501 miles from Cape Town) to Prieska.

At 644 miles, on the main line, about 3 miles south of Kimberley, the Central South African Railways' line from Bloemfontein joins up with the Cape Government Western Main Line. Four miles of this line are in the Cape Colony.

At 644 miles on the main line, about 47 miles north of Kimberley, viz., at Fourteen Streams, the Cape line is joined by the C.S.A.R.'s line from Johannesburg, via Klerksdorp. Three miles of this line are in Cape Colony.

Mafeking (870 miles from Cape Town) to Buurman's Drift, on the Transvaal Border.

Although branching from the Rhodesia Company's line, this line belongs to the Cape Government (by purchase).

The Midland Main Line extends from Port Elizabeth to Norval's Pont Bridge.

Where it joins the C.S.A.R.'s line, running northward through the Orange River Colony and Transvaal.

A junction with the Western Line at De Aar is effected by a section of the Midland Main Line... Which leaves the direct line to the O.R.C. at Naauwport Junction.

The following lines are included in the Midland System:

Mossel Bay to George...

This line is worked by the New Cape Central Railway Company for the Government.

Port Elizabeth to Avontuur...

(This is a 2-ft. gauge line.)

From Valley Junction on this line (3 miles from Port Elizabeth) there is a short 2-ft. gauge line to Walmer.

The Government is guaranteed against loss on working this line, and interest on capital, for a period of 10 years from 16-12-06.

Loop line from Zwartkops (7 miles from Port Elizabeth on main line) via Uitenhage and Graaf Reinet to Rosmead Junction.

From Klipplaat on this loop, there is a branch to Oudtshoorn.

Branches from Midland Main Line:

Except where otherwise stated, the lines are all of the Standard Colonial Gauge of 3 ft. 6 in.

On the 31st December, 1908, the mileage of the Cape Government Railways open for traffic was 3,265. The gross receipts for the twelve months ended December 31st, 1907, were £2,850,139/- compared with £3,469,936/- for the year 1907. The working expenses were £2,246,881/- compared with £2,572,634/- for the year 1907, resulting in a return of £1,174,881/- per cent. on capital expended as compared with £2,165,114/- per cent. for the previous year.

Through railway communication now exists between all the Government lines of the Cape Colony to Bulawayo, Victoria Falls and Broken Hill and Salisbury in Rhodesia; to Beira in Portuguese East Africa; to Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Pietersburg on the Central South African Railways; and to Durban and other important centres in Natal, and Delagoa Bay in the Portuguese territory.

The lines are well and substantially laid, and both the rate of speed and their general comfort and equipment are admittedly creditable. Especial attention is devoted to the peculiar requirements of long journeys and the variations of climate experienced. Corridor saloons, carefully constructed with a view to comfort and stability, are provided on the through trains. They are fitted with lavatory accommodation and electric light, while the provision of bedding at reasonable charges adds materially to the comfort of the passengers.

Owing to the opening of the Klarskorp-Fourteen Streams line, there are now alternative routes to the Transvaal from Cape Town. There is a morning train daily from Cape Town to Johannesburg and Pretoria via Kimberley and Klarskorp. On Tuesdays this train starts from the Cape Town docks for the convenience of passengers who arrive by the mail steamer from England, and conveys first, second and third class passengers direct from the docks at Cape Town to Kimberley and stations in the Transvaal, including Johannesburg, Pretoria, Klarskorp and Potchefstroom; the train also serves stations in the Western district of the Cape Colony—Worcester, Matjiesfontein, Laingsburg, Beaufort West, etc.

A through sleeping saloon for Bulawayo and Victoria Falls is attached to the train and goes forward from Kimberley to Victoria Falls by the train de luxe, leaving the former station each Wednesday evening.

The dining and sleeping saloon train starts from the boat side, and completes the journey from Cape Town to Kimberley in 30½ hours, and to Johannesburg in 43½ hours.

Passengers by mail steamers for up-country who are desirous of reaching their destinations as early as possible, and who do not wish to spend any time in Cape Town, are thus enabled to purchase their tickets, entrain at ship's side, and continue their journey at once.

A railway official boards the vessels before disembarkment for the purpose of affording information to intending passengers, and special arrangements have been made with the Customs Department for dealing expeditiously with their baggage.

A conductor and also an experienced chef accompany the train, and passengers can obtain all meals on board at a fixed tariff as well as other refreshments at moderate charges.

There is also a train leaving Cape Town every evening travelling to the Transvaal via Naasvoorpoort and the Orange River Colony, with a connection daily from De Aar to Kimberley, Port Elizabeth, East London, etc.

On Thursdays the "Transvaal Express" train de luxe runs from Cape Town to Johannesburg and Pretoria via Kimberley and Fourteen Streams.

In connection with the daily train to the Transvaal, via Kimberley, the Zambesi express train de luxe (first and second class), the property of the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, runs from Kimberley on Wednesdays to the Victoria Falls.

Passengers by all through trains to the Transvaal, Orange River Colony, and Rhodesia are supplied with meals by means of dining cars attached to the trains. The catering, which is under the management of a special branch of the railway department, gives every satisfaction. The catering on the Rhodesia Company's train de luxe is in the hands of the Cape Government Railways Refreshment Department, between Kimberley and Bulawayo.

The character of the country traversed near the coast is greatly diversified on each system, though when the higher altitudes are reached the general characteristics are usually similar. On the Western and Midland systems the scenery is perhaps the more imposing, while on the former line the vast stretches of the dry Karroo region, apparently barren and parched throughout a great portion of the year, are not without a certain charm of their own.

After rains the great latent fertility of the Karroo region is apparent, for, within a marvellously short space of time, the whole face of the country becomes carpeted with flowers of brilliant hue, which, with the bright crispness of the atmosphere, add greatly to the enjoyment of the traveller.

The Eastern line through much of its length traverses an open grassy country, presenting many interesting features.

Sets of lantern slides comprising photographs of places of interest in the Cape Colony have been prepared in England for loan to schools, educational bodies and the public. These slides are obtainable
from the Agent-General for the Cape of Good Hope, 100, Victoria street, London, S.W.

The Government issues tariff books, corrected periodically by the railway authorities, containing full information upon all matters likely to be of interest or service to the public, such as fares, rates, distances, etc.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, and East London. These Ports are now under the direct control of the Cape Colonial Government.

The expenditure upon construction of works at Table Bay to the 31st December, 1908, has been £4,171,152., and the annual charges for interest and maintenance, including working, are respectively about £114,016. and £96,297.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater, and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 64 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 72½ acres, with a depth ranging from 20 to 35 feet at low water.

Many of the quays are equipped with the most modern appliances for handling cargo, such as electric cranes and capstans; and commodious warehouses are erected in various parts of the Dock. The normal capacity of the docks is 8,000 tons per diem.

The Breakwater is completed to a length of 3,640 feet, and affords protection to vessels anchored in the Bay.

The graving dock is 500 feet on the keel blocks, with a depth of 24½ feet over the cill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T., and a slip is available for vessels up to 500 tons.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet long, which cost £260,000., and a third jetty, 1,460 feet in length, which cost £185,000.

In addition to the above, there is an explosives jetty, 1,380 feet from the shore, with an aerial ropeway communication. This ropeway is capable of landing 150 tons per day.

There is also a slipway capable of accommodating vessels of 400 tons dead weight.

The Port has an electrical plant, with an output of 236 kilowatts, put down for lighting and power purposes. This plant includes one 10 ton and two 5 ton overhead gantries, and a 20 ton crane.

The Port's hydraulic plant consists of three pumping engines each of 200 horse-power, working 29 wharf cranes, 12 capstans, and 4 wool hoists.

The total storage area of the Board's warehouses is about 35,000 square yards.

At East London, at the mouth of the Buffalo River, successful harbour works have been carried out, overcoming the obstruction of sand-bars, which previously to a great extent closed the mouth of the river. The entrance to the river is now protected and sheltered by a solid south breakwater and improved by means of two training walls. The depth of water about the entrance is maintained by three steam pump-hopper dredgers of the latest type. A least depth of water over the bar of about 19 feet at low water ordinary spring tides is available throughout the year. The width between training walls at entrance to river is 250 feet. Steamers of over 8,000 tons gross register now enter the river and discharge cargo alongside wharves. The harbour is well equipped with steam, hydraulic and electric cranes, with a lifting capacity from 2½ up to 50 tons, and possesses a patent slip capable of accommodating vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight. A new quay on the most up-to-date lines has been constructed on the west bank of the river, and will be found the most convenient quay in Africa. The whole of the arrangements on this side are in accordance with the best European models, and cargoes will be landed and despatched with exceptional rapidity—goods being either loaded direct from the ship's hold on to railway trucks or deposited into very spacious sheds. The discharging appliances on this quay will be operated by electricity, and will be of the most modern design. To the 31st December, 1908, there had been spent on works, £2,014,597.

Industries.

The chief industries are the production of wool, mohair, brandy, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco, fruit, lucerne and maize, and the breeding of horses, mules, cattle, goats, sheep and ostriches. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are hardware and machinery, wearing apparel of all descriptions, and material therefor, sugar, coffee, other foodstuffs, timber (including manufactured articles), oils, tobacco, and wines and spirits.

The quantity of wine produced in the Colony during 1904, the census year, amounted to 5,686,672 gallons, spirits, to 1,534,069 gallons, and vinegar to 113,862½ gallons, practically all consumed locally. In 1908 there were produced 5,388,991 gallons of wine, 1,153,668 gallons of brandy, and 117,024 gallons of vinegar.

Ostrich breeding is carried on largely as heretofore, but farmers are now devoting more attention to the quality of the feathers in their breeding birds than in former years.

In 1860 the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1908 it amounted to 637,814 lbs., valued at £1,738,389.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 403,153 lbs., 16,866,530 lbs. The export of wool has risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871. In 1908 the export was 75,203,373 lbs., valued at £1,848,835.

The export of wool and mohair, though showing for 1904 and 1905 a marked decrease on that of 1902, due to the drought which for a few years prevailed in the greater portion of the Colony, increased in 1906. The high price of slaughter stock has induced the farmers to turn their attention more to cross-breeding for the production of mutton, and this also has had some influence in the decreased export of wool. The tendency is, however, again in favour of breeding pure-woolled sheep.

The movement in the direction of grading and sorting of wool is gradually becoming general throughout the Colony. Every effort is being made to foster this movement, and the Government have arranged for expert demonstrations throughout the Colony, and sanguine hopes are entertained of successful results. Among other measures for the amelioration of the agricultural industries of the country, co-operation has begun to play a part, and efforts are being put forward to induce farmers to combine and organise their forces in developing both the production and the subsequent advantageous disposal of their produce.
The above undertakings are carried out under the direct supervision of the Department of Agriculture, which is also charged with the control of all matters connected with the Game Laws, animal industry and diseases, diseases of plants, the suppression of insect pests, viticulture, horticulture, and all other subjects allied with agriculture. Among the other important works being carried out are the investigation of agricultural conditions by means of experiment stations and plots, the distribution of new varieties of seeds, etc., to farmers for experimental purposes and the diffusion of agricultural knowledge among the farming community by means of the publications of the department as well as by lectures and demonstrations by its various experts. The subject of agricultural education also falls within the scope of the department and a well-equipped Agricultural College exists at Elsenburg in the Stellenbosch division.

Large areas of the Colony are peculiarly adapted for the breeding of mules as the nature of the veld renders any other feeding unnecessary. The industry has been largely taken up in these areas and many farmers are importing jackasses for this purpose. In horse-breeding also there has been renewed activity, the practice of former years, viz., crossing the Colonial mares with English thoroughbred stallions, having been largely reverted to, and, on account of the large importation of racing stock, there is no lack of suitable sires in the country.

The Minister for Agriculture, through the Surveyor-General, also administers all matters connected with the Land Laws of the Colony, Geological Exploration and Survey. The Crown Forests of the Colony also come within his portfolio, being under the direct control of the Chief Conservator of Forests.

**Lands.**

Those desiring to acquire Crown Lands in the Cape Colony must now either compete at public auction at the sales of surveyed lands held under Act 15 of 1887 from time to time as occasion seems to demand in the various districts of the Colony, or they must apply for certain specified areas or farms which have been set aside for selection under Act 37 of 1882 or Act 40 of 1895.

Both these Acts were designed to enable sons of the soil without means, such as the sons of farmers, to obtain land without necessitating the investment of capital, and they require the applicant to select and name the piece of ground he requires; and if his request be entertained, a licence for five years is issued at a rental calculated at 5 per cent. on the capitalised assessed value of the land. Upon the termination of the licence and fulfilment of the conditions respecting occupation and (in the case of Act 37 of 1882) cultivation, the licensee is entitled to a title deed under Act 37 of 1882 on quit-rent tenure, and, under Act 40 of 1895, on payment of the purchase price in instalments extending over 15 years, the balance of unpaid instalments and the survey expenses being secured by a mortgage in favour of the Government.

Act 37 of 1882 deals with small holdings, not larger than 250 morgen, and is suitable for districts in the vicinity of markets where la petite culture may be carried on profitably, but Act 40 of 1895 is rather applicable to cattle or sheep runs of 3,000 to 6,000 morgen in extent, and is most suitable for pastoral districts.

Under Act 15 of 1887, farms in extent varying from the cattle ranch to the market garden or town building lot are surveyed by the Government, and advertised for sale from time to time to the highest bidder at an upset price. The price is assessed at the current market value in the district, and is of course subject to enhancement by competition, but the terms of payment are very easy, one-fifth of the price at which the land is sold being payable within the first 12 months—viz., one-tenth within 6 months and one-tenth within 12 months, and the remainder being secured by a first mortgage at 4 per cent. The balance of the purchase price may, if the purchaser desires it, be paid at once, or in portions of not less than £50 at a time. In case, however, the purchase price is less than £25 the whole amount must be paid in cash at once, or in equal instalments extending over 3 years, and bearing interest at 4 per cent. per annum from the date of sale.

**Fishery.**

The Fishery Laws and the Guano Islands are also administered by the department, and in connection with the former a properly-equipped steam trawler, the *Pieter Faure*, was imported in 1897 with a view to opening up the Fishing Industry of the Colony. The work was of a most satisfactory nature, the trials made proved that large quantities of fish are easily procurable by trawling. Private enterprise has followed the prospecting work of the Government, and the trawling industry is now firmly established. The trout acclimatisation work is still being carried on with a most gratifying measure of success, and several rivers have now been opened for public fishing.

**Forests.**

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Cape Colony is approximately 660,000 morgen (1,800,000 acres). The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests. The Colony is divided into four Conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna and Umtata respectively, who are directly responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Colony. The present annual importation of timber into the Colony is about 3,000,000 cubic feet, mostly pine, derived from Europe and America, the balance being hardwood from Australia. There is at present a large importation of hardwood sleepers. Expenditure on Forests for year 1908, £51,698; Revenue, £30,017.

**Diamonds.**

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate Colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond doubts were thrown on its origin. Nothing like an organised or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment,
then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delport's Hope. Owing to the depression in the diamond market the only Dry Mines at present being worked are Kimberley, Bultfontein and Wessellton in the Division of Kimberley, and a part of Smith's Prospect Mine, owned by the Welgelegen Company, in the Division of Barkly West. The alluvial diggings at present worked commence at Fourteen Streams, extending principally on the north bank of Vaal River to Delport's Hope, in the Division of Barkly West, and Douglas, in the Division of Herbert, including the Diggings known as Brypaul, Schmidts Drift Proper and Plat Drift; and opposite Hebron, and on the south bank, lie the Wedburg Kopje and the Robinson Diggings, in the Division of Kimberley; also on the south bank, below the village of Barkly and in the Division of Barkly West, lie the Waldeck Plant Diggings, Niekerk Rush and Vaal River Estates.

In October, 1899, an Act was promulgated (No. 11 of 1899) to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prospecting and mining for precious stones in the Colony. This has been amended by Act No. 27 of 1907.

The following table gives the total quantity and value of the export of diamonds during the past five years:

|       | 1904     | 1905     | 1906     | 1907     | 1908     |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Carats.| 2,631,878| 2,335,646| 6,270,572| 2,491,405| 1,846,401|
| £      | 5,520,743| 4,850,659| 6,834,360| 5,978,631| 3,191,582|

Other Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormberg is extensively used upon the Cape Government railways, with good results, both as regards the working of the lines and the development of an industry, the importance of which to the Colony cannot be overrated.

In the neighbourhood of the Indwe, trending in a north-east direction, are considerable tracts of Crown land as yet untested, but reported by mining and geological experts to be in all probability the seat of valuable deposits of coal. It has been suggested that these beds may be connected with those found on the north-west border of Natal.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist. Much activity has recently been displayed in this direction owing to the increased demand for copper in manufactures.

The output from the mines in 1908 was 108,708 tons.

During the year 1897 a series of thorough comparative tests was made by the Railway Department of all coals (Welsh, Cape Colonial, Orange Free State and Transvaal) used by the Cape Locomotive Department. Of the mines which supplied the different samples of coal thus tested, twelve are situated in Cape Colony. The trials were carried out on the Eastern System of Railways between East London and Queenstown. The results obtained showed that the value of a given quantity of the best Cape coal, for use in locomotive or stationary engines, was, roughly speaking, about two-thirds that of an equal quantity of imported ocean Merthyr coal. Among the best Colonial coals for making steam are those from the following mines: Contat's, Penshaw, Indwe, Cape Collieries, and "Wallsend." The Indwe coal possesses the advantage, as regards its use in locomotives, of containing little or no sulphur. The Cypherget and the Molteneo coals are highly bituminous, and the latter has a deservedly high reputation as house coal, but is not so suitable for locomotives as coal of a semi-anthracite nature, like "Wallsend."

The Indwe mine, which is situated in the division of Wodehouse, is connected with the Government railways by a line joining the Eastern system at Sterktroom. All the other mines in the Colony are served by the Eastern system. The total output from the Colonial mines during the year 1908 is returned at 122,865 tons. The coal areas in the Colony are of considerable extent, and there is reason to hope that, with increased facilities in mining and transport, the output will improve in quantity and quality.

The laws regulating the working of baser minerals are Acts Nos. 9 of 1877 and 15 of 1883, under which regulations are published by G.N. 633 of 1900. These Acts are repealed by Act No. 16 of 1907, except in so far as they apply to existing baser mineral leases.

Precious Minerals.

Gold.

The Millwood Gold Fields, in the Division of Knysna, the Spreeuwfontein Alluvial Diggings, in the Division of Prince Albert, and the Madibi Reef Digging, in the Division of Mafeking, are the only proclaimed gold fields in the Colony, and the total registered output to the 31st August, 1909, is 5,546 ozs. 19 dwt. 8 grs. In January, 1889, an Act (No. 31 of 1898) was promulgated to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prospecting and mining for precious minerals in the Cape Colony, subsequently amended by Act 45 of 1905, and Act 16 of 1907.

Geological Survey.

The geological survey of the Colony was begun in 1896. The area mapped includes all that to the south-west of a line drawn from Van Rhyn's Dorp to Humansdorp, and very nearly the whole of the area north of the Orange River—e.g., Bechuanaland, Griqualand West, and part of Gordonia. South of the Orange River the survey has been carried down to De Aar and Canarvon. There have also been mapped the divisions of
Aliwal North, Barkly East, Herschel, Xalanga, Elliot, Glen Grey, Kentani, and portions of Wodehouse, Queenstown, Uitenhage, Alexandria, and Matatiele. Maps of some of these divisions have been published in the Reports for 1901 to 1907, but eleven sheets of the geological map of Cape Colony on the scale of 1,600 cape roods (3.8 miles) to the inch have been issued separately—e.g., three of the south-western districts and eight of the northern. Several other sheets are in course of publication.

The formations hitherto met with in Cape Colony are classified as follows, omitting two whose positions and relationships are as yet uncertain:

Recent or Superficial Deposits. Tertiary and Post-Tertiary

  - Zoetief Series. (Unconformity.)
- Kraaijpan Series. (Unconformity.)
- Kheis Series.

The Malmsbury and Kheis Series are invaded by granite and gneiss. The other formations up to and including the Karroo System have intrusions of basic rocks only.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account.

Since the beginning of 1892, the banks having their head offices outside the Colony are only allowed to issue notes supplied to them by the Government, which holds securities deposited by the institution for the total supply of such notes given to the banks. The notes are legal tender and guaranteed by the Government, the banks having to redeem the notes in gold on demand at their chief places of business.

Banks having their head office in the Colony, and having been registered on the 1st January, 1891, can continue to issue their own notes, which are neither guaranteed nor legal tender.

There are 6 banks with 151 branches in Cape Colony:—The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (97 branches), the Bank of Africa, Limited (22 branches), the African Banking Corporation, Limited (22 branches), the Stellenbosch District Bank, Limited, the National Bank of South Africa, Limited (5 branches), and the Netherlands Bank of South Africa.

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1909, was 920,188L; legal tender, 913,567L; other, 6,621L.

Education.

Under the Education Act, No. 13 of 1865, School Board Act, No. 35 of 1905, and the Higher Education Act, No. 24 of 1874, the Department administers Parliamentary grants to colleges, and to the following classes of schools, viz.:—Undenominational public, district boarding, evening, private farm, poor, mission, aborigines, institutions, art schools, training schools for teachers, and industrial schools for poor whites, for the following purposes, viz.: part payment of salaries, purchase of buildings, furniture, apparatus, and books; training of teachers; support of indigent boarders.

Schools are managed and teachers appointed, subject to the control of the department, by School Boards and by local committees or managers.

The Government grants are, generally speaking, given to supplement local contributions of at least equal amount. The necessary grants are provided from the general revenue, and provision is made for the assessment of a local rate by Divisional or Municipal Councils to bear any actual shortage in the accounts of School Boards. The department further undertakes the periodical inspection of schools, collects and publishes educational statistics, and issues certificates of professional competency to teachers.

The School Board Act, No. 35 of 1905, as amended by Acts 25 of 1906 and 45 of 1908, provides for the division of the country into school districts under the control of School Boards elected by the local ratepayers, charged with the supervision of all public and poor schools.

The Government expenditure on education in 1908-09 was 521,713L. On the 30th of June, 1909, there were in operation five colleges and 3,681 schools of various classes.

The University.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877. Chancellor: H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, K.G., K.T., K.P.

Under Acts No. 6 of 1896 and No. 5 of 1908 the University is empowered to confer the following additional degrees:—Litt.D., B.Sc., M.Sc., D.Sc., Bachelor of Music, Master of Music, Doctor of Music, Bachelor of Divinity, Doctor of Divinity.
The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowment, etc. The Council consists of 38 members.

In 1908 the number of students who matriculated was 863, 184 passed the intermediate examination in Arts, and 93 took direct degrees.

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually, and 13,514 candidates have passed the School Higher examination during the years 1876-1908.

Sea and Land Communications.

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 9 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helens and Ascension. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the company, under agreement with the Imperial Post Office.

A mail train leaves Cape Town daily, at 11.0 a.m., serving Kimberley and the Transvaal. Another train leaves Cape Town daily at 8.30 p.m., serving the Orange River Colony, Transvaal and Natal, the Midland and Eastern Districts of the Cape Colony and also Kimberley and Vryburg. The 11.0 a.m. train is extended four times weekly to Mafeking, and three times to Bulawayo; the one leaving Cape Town at 11.0 a.m. on Tuesdays connecting with the Rhodesia Train-de-Luxe, which runs from Kimberley on Wednesdays, arriving at the Victoria Falls on Saturday mornings, a first class saloon being run through from Cape Town.

On Thursdays the Transvaal Express Train-de-Luxe leaves Cape Town at 11.0 a.m. for Johannesburg and Pretoria, via Kimberley, carrying first class passengers only as far as Kimberley, and first and second class passengers from Kimberley to Johannesburg and Pretoria.

In the opposite direction, the Imperial Mail Train-de-Luxe runs via the Orange River Colony, leaving Pretoria and Johannesburg on Monday evenings, reaching Cape Town on Wednesdays at 2.5 p.m., and going through to the Cape Town Docks for the convenience of passengers for the mail steamer leaving for England on that day.

On Tuesdays a train conveying mails only is despatched from the docks to all parts of South Africa with the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with the Orange River Colony daily; with Natal daily, via the Orange River Colony; with Rhodesia (Mashonaland, &c.) three times a week; and with the Transvaal twice daily by rail, viz.—via Kimberley and Fourteen Streams, and, by another route, through the Orange River Colony. The former is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in two days.

Overland communication is effected by rail between Cape Town and Delagoa Bay daily, through the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal. The journey is performed in 69½ hours.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, are also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A frequent service from Cape Town to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill, and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund's Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australian Steamship Company.

The number of Colonial post offices is 1,065, and of money order offices, 365. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to £47,368, in 1908, the revenue was £80,707, and the commission on money orders, £14,643.

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884. On 31st December, 1908, there was a sum of £2,654,062, deposited to the credit of 100,008 depositors. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. on deposits and 3½ per cent. on certificates. Savings bank business is transacted at all money order offices.

The telegraph system is well developed. There are 31,836 miles of telegraph wire, and 5,751 miles of telephone wire open, erected by the Government at a cost of £30,150L, the gross earnings in 1908 being £166,559, and the expenditure £217,743. Number of telegraph offices, 587.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent, by the Western route, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Durban, Mauritius and Cocos.

The weights and measures in use are British: besides which there are the morgen=2½ acres, the Cape foot=1'03 feet, and the Cape ton=2,000 lbs.

Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1904 the total population of the Colony was found to be 2,409,804, comprising 1,218,940 males, and 1,190,864 females.

In the Colony proper the European birth rate in 1904 was computed to be 31·81 per 1,000, the Coloured rate at 30·77. The death rate amongst Europeans was 12·61 per 1,000, and the Coloured rate 25·42, during the same year.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.
There is a Legislative Council of 26 elected Members, presided over, *ex officio*, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 107 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Ministers are the Prime Minister, the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Public Works, and the Secretary for Agriculture, all of whom are Members of the Legislature and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from March to June.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act, 39 of 1877, a member is added to the Council for that Province, and one has been since added for Bechuanaland (Act No. 41 of 1896). Under the Additional Parliamentary Representation Act of 1904 an additional member is added to the Council for the Western, South-Eastern and Eastern Electoral Provinces respectively, who are thus now entitled to return 4 members each, and 12 new members were added to the House of Assembly. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000 or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. For the purpose of the House of Assembly elections the Colony is divided into 46 electoral divisions. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act of 1892) by possession of property worth £75 or receipt of salary or wages of not less than £50 per annum; but no one can be newly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation. The number of registered electors in 1907 was 152,135. The Registration Act, No. 14 of 1887, makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy, and further provision in the direction of improved machinery is made in the Parliamentary Representation Act, No. 19 of 1898, the Registration of Parliamentary Voters Amendment Act No. 48 of 1899, the Parliamentary Indemnity Act, No. 5 of 1902, and in the Parliamentary Elections Act of 1908.

Elections are now conducted under the Ballot Act, as amended by Acts No. 48 of 1899 and No. 6 of 1908.

Members of either House are paid one guinea per day, with 15s. per day extra for not more than 90 days if residing over 15 miles from Capetown. Speeches may be made either in English or in Dutch (Law No. 1 of 1882).

By an Act, No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852 were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The Supreme Court, as consolidated by Act 35 of 1896, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puine Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall the territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, Pondoland and Tembuland. The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts; the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court hold sessions at Kimberley.

The Roman-Dutch Law prevails in the Colony, as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

By Act No. 3 of 1890, the Supreme Court has been constituted a Court of Appeal under the Africa Order in Council of 1889, and a similar arrangement exists for Rhodesia.

(For the Act of Union, 1909, see under SOUTH AFRICA.)

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and Crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of six to eight elective members, exclusive of the Civil Commissioner, who is usually also Resident Magistrate, as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns fourteen members. The electors are the owners or occupiers of immovable property, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than £500. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they also have important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They were 81 in number in 1908, and their receipts during the year amounted to £310,745. Payments for the same period amounted to £311,505. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an Ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. Certain municipalities are under special Acts, but all Town Councils or municipalities under the General Municipal Act, 1882, have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There are 119 municipalities in the Colony, the receipts from all sources during
the year 1908 amounted to £1,292,468. The amount of loans outstanding, 31st December, 1908 (excluding bank overdrafts), was £6,170,789, and the assessed rateable value of fixed property was £56,633,401. Payments during the same period amounted to £1,293,387. The Controller and Auditor-General has no general control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 89 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 or 5 members elected annually by the voters registered for parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1907-8 to £10,930. 5s., excluding balances.

Dependent Territories.

Basutoland, which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of His Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under the heading of South Africa.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amoaxoa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the Special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now annexed to Cape Colony (see below).

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Nomans Land, as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1886, the Chief KRELI requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas. Palir, chief of the Ametahezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The PondoMisi tribe, under the chiefs Umditsha and Umhlonhlo, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, UMQIKELA, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Ngwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Ngwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now subject to Colonial rule, and had a revenue of £171,153 in 1903-4. All of this is included in the ordinary Colonial revenue.

They are now re-grouped under one Chief Magistrate, stationed at Umtata, and assisted by an Assistant Chief Magistrate, also stationed at Umtata.

Griqualand East has nine subordinate magistrates. Its population at the Census of 1904 was—Europeans, 5,901; Bantu, 212,069; mixed, 4,062. Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, and East and West Pondoland, has fourteen subordinate magistrates.
It has a population of—Europeans, 8,056; Bantu, 221,313; mixed, 1,327.
