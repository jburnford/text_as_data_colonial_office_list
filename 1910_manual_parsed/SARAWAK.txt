SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 42,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 500,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1885 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, and the transfer was approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in August, 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1905. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born June, 1829; married 1869, Margaret Alice Lily de Windt), is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868.

Heir, Charles Vyner Brooke (Rajah Muda), born 26th September, 1874.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 32', E. long. 110° 28'), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses an excellent hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 100 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baram Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang.
