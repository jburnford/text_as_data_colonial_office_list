NYASALAND PROTECTORATE.

(See Map under Rhodesia, South Africa).

Situation and Area.

The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shiré Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shiré) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shiré Highlands and Milanje.

It is bounded on the north by German East Africa, on the west by the British South Africa Company's Territory known as "North Eastern Rhodesia," on the south and east by Portuguese East Africa, and has a total area of about 43,608 square miles, according to the most recent survey.

It is divided into thirteen districts, each in charge of a resident, who is also a district magistrate. An agent of the Government is stationed at Chiude at the mouth of the Zambesi, where a concession has been leased from the Portuguese Government as a landing and forwarding depot for goods intended for British Territory north of the Zambesi, and where a Postal Agency is also established.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shiré Highlands, where there are about 200 Europeans. The headquarters of the Government are at Zomba.

History.

In 1859 Dr. Livingstone was placed at the head of a Government Expedition, and reached the southern shore of Lake Nyasa on the 16th of September of that year. His expedition was recalled in 1863, but resulted in the founding, from 1874 to 1881, of various Missionary Societies,
notably the Universities Mission, the Livingstonia Mission, and the Church of Scotland Mission.

The Missions were followed by the African Lakes Corporation, and in 1883 Captain Foote, R.N., was appointed first British Consul for the Territories north of the Zambesi, to reside at Blantyre.

Opposition of the new settlers to the slave trade carried on by Arab coastmen and natives alike resulted in a conflict with the Arab traders under Chief Mlozi, settled at the north end of Lake Nyasa, which spread to the Yao chiefs, who were under their influence.

In 1889 public attention was drawn to Nyasaland by the application for a Charter by the British South Africa Company, and the despatch of an imposing expedition under Major Serpa Pinto to the Upper Zambesi and Lower Loangwa. At the same time Mr. D. Rankin announced the discovery of a navigable entrance to the Zambesi by the Chinde mouth.

In the summer of 1889 Mr. Johnston (now Sir H. H. Johnston, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) arrived at Mozambique as H.B.M. Consul, and proceeded to travel in the interior to inquire into the troubles with the Arabs.

Treaties having been concluded with the remaining Makololo chiefs and with the Yaos round Blantyre, Mr. Johnston proceeded up Lake Nyasa, leaving Mr. John Buchanan, Acting-Consul, in charge, who, after the first encounter between Major Serpa Pinto and Mlauri, a powerful Makololo chief, proclaimed on the 21st September, 1889, a British Protectorate over the Shiré districts.

Mr. Johnston, during his progress up the Lake, induced the "Jumbe" or Sultan of Kota-Kota to place his country under British protection, and on arriving at Karonga arranged similar treaties with Mlozi and other Arab and Walenga chiefs, after which he proceeded to Lake Tanganyika. On his return an agreement was made with Mponda, a Yao chief at the south end of Nyasa.

In 1891, an Anglo-Portuguese convention ratified the work of Mr. Johnston, Mr. Sharpe (now Sir A. Sharpe, K.C.M.G., C.B.), and other pioneers of British Central Africa, and in the following spring a British Protectorate over the countries adjoining Nyasa was proclaimed. The Protectorate of Nyasaland, under the administration of an Imperial Commissioner, was confined to the regions adjoining the Shiré and Lake Nyasa; the remainder of the territory under British influence north of the Zambesi being placed, subject to certain conditions, under the British South Africa Company.

In the autumn of 1891 an expedition was successfully conducted by the Commissioner and Captain Maguire against Mohandanji and Mponda, slave-raiding Yaos at the south end of Nyasa, which resulted in the former being attacked and his followers effectually dispersed, and the latter suing for peace after his town had been shelled. The next few years brought much trouble to the Protectorate in the way of slave-trading and constant raids, but owing to three gun-boats being placed on the Lake for the suppression of the slave trade, further reinforcements of Siklis arriving from India, and the recruitment of native troops from the Atonga of West Nyasa, the slave trade was abolished and the peaceful development of the Protectorate secured. On the 22nd February, 1893, the name of the Protectorate was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate," but the old name "Nyasaland Protectorate" was revived in October, 1907, by the Order in Council which amended the Constitution.

**Constitution.**

The administration of the Protectorate, which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order in Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same Order Executive and Legislative Councils were established.

The Laws consist of local Ordinances duly enacted with such British Acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in Civil and Criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate Courts are held by Magistrates and Assistant Magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decision of the High Court are heard in H.B.M.'s Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa sitting at Zanzibar.

This Court will be transferred to East Africa in January, 1910. Place of sitting fixed for Mombasa.

**Climate and Products.**

There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the Shire Valley and Lake Nyasa, the other of the Shiré Highlands and the rest of the country which lies at a high elevation. The first has a rainfall averaging 35 inches yearly, and a temperature which touches 120° in the summer. The second has a pleasant climate, the thermometer ranging from 96° or 97° in the summer to a minimum of about 40° in the winter. The rainfall in the Shiré Highlands varies from about 40 to 100 inches.

**Industry.**

The chief products of the Protectorate are cotton, coffee, tobacco, tea, chillies, rubber, rice, maize, wheat; rice and wheat, however, are not exported.

The chief imports are, provisions, cotton goods, earthenware, hardware, wines and spirits, salt, silk and woollen goods, agricultural machinery, arms and ammunition.

**Population (31st March, 1909).**

Europeans, 594; Asiatics (not including Sikh Troops), 457; Natives, 996,166.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway from Port Herald (the inland "port" of the Protectorate) to Blantyre (113 miles) is open for traffic. An extension to Zomba and Fort Johnston, on Lake Nyasa, is contemplated. There are sixteen steamers plying on the Zambesi and Shiré between Chinde and the highest navigable point of the Shiré, whence the journey to the Shiré Highlands is continued by rail and road. Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the Protectorate, the total mileage being 3,102. There are seven steamers on Lake Nyasa.

Steamers arrive and depart every three weeks at Chinde (the port of entry at the mouth of the Zambesi) to Europe, via the Suez Canal, or by Durban and Cape Town. Mails to and from England, are despatched every week via Cape Town and Beira.

**Rates of Postage.**

ORANGE RIVER COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Orange River Colony lies to the north of the Orange River and Cape Colony, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts.

The population, according to the last census, which was taken in 1904, was 387,315, of whom 142,679 were white.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Mosesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the inrush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won
general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted * in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the establishment of Responsible Government, July, 1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown Colony Government was established, and continued till 1907, when Responsible Government was granted. The election of the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907.

**Constitution.**

Letters Patent providing for the establishment of Responsible Government in the Orange River Colony were issued on June 5th, and promulgated on July 1st, 1907. In their main features the provisions approximate very closely to those of the Transvaal Constitution.

The Legislature consists of two Chambers—namely, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly.

The Legislative Council comprises eleven members, who, in the first instance, are nominated by the Governor. Of these three vacate their seat at the expiration of their third year of office, four at the end of the fifth year, and four at the end of the seventh year. Their places will be filled by persons to be appointed by the Governor in Council, who will hold office for five years from the date of appointment. Appointments to fill casual vacancies are also to be made by the Governor in Council, but such appointments will continue only until the completion of the period for which the retiring member would have held office.

It will, however, be lawful at any time after four years from the date of the first meeting of the Council for the Legislature to pass a law providing for the election of members of the Legislative Council.

Members of the Legislative Council must not be less than thirty years of age, and must have resided in the Colony for three years, and possess the electoral qualification.

The Legislative Assembly originally consisted of thirty-eight members. A Bill was, however, passed by the Legislature during the 1908 session, providing for separate representation for the district of Jacobsdal. The Act has come into force, and the Assembly now consists of 39 members. Members are returned for single member constituencies.

*For an account of the events leading up to the war and the war itself, see "Transvaal."*

The existing magisterial districts are generally retained as separate units, being sub-divided where a district is entitled to more than one member, but in one instance two such districts are amalgamated as one constituency.

In case of sub-division the boundaries of the existing Magisterial Wards are, as far as possible, followed. Every white male British subject is entitled to be registered as a voter if he has resided in the Colony for six months, either immediately before the framing of the register or within three years in case of temporary absence during those six months. The qualification for membership of the Assembly is the same as the voters' qualification. There will be an automatic redistribution of seats, on a voters' basis, at the end of every four years. The Legislative Assembly and any elected Legislative Council will be dissolved at the end of five years, or earlier, at the option of the Governor. The Speaker of the Assembly will be elected by members, and will, on election, vacate his seat.

The language of debate in the Legislature will be either English or Dutch, the language of record being English, while copies of votes and proceedings, and of all proposed laws, will be printed in both languages, in accordance with the practice observed in Cape Colony. It is provided that, in the event of disagreement between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the Governor may convene a joint sitting of the members of both Houses, presided over by the Speaker of the Assembly, when the matter at issue shall be decided by an absolute majority of both Houses. The Legislature will have power to alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Letters Patent, but any Bill effecting such repeal or alteration must be reserved.

The following Laws must also be reserved—namely, any Law whereby persons not of European birth or descent are subjected to restrictions or disabilities not imposed on persons of European birth, or providing for the introduction under contract, indenture or license of labourers into the Colony from places outside South Africa. Special provision is made with regard to the system of Lands Settlement established under Crown Colony Government. The Governor was to appoint and control for five years a Lands Settlement Board, consisting of three members, which will be a body corporate, and will exercise and discharge the rights and duties conferred and imposed on the Government of the Colony by any Law or agreement in respect of Lands Settlement property and the persons in occupation thereof. The Lands Settlement property will consist of all lands held by settlers at the date of the Board's appointment under the Lands Settlement Ordinances, and all other fixed property in any town or village purchased by the Government out of funds allocated for the purposes of Lands Settlement, all movable property vested in the Government and used in connection with such lands or other fixed property, and all stock required for Lands Settlement purposes.

All such property, together with all moneys paid to the Government by settlers, and held by it on the day of the Board's appointment for or on account of Lands Settlement, and any balance of money appropriated to the Government by the Inter-Colonial Council for Lands Settlement purposes, or which with the approval of the Secretary of State may subsequently be so appropriated, will be transferred to and vested in the Board during its five years' existence.
The Government of the Colony may at any time prior to the termination of the four years (subject to the consent of the Governor and the approval of the Secretary of State) enter into an agreement with the Board for determining the functions of the Board at an earlier date.

For the Act of Union, 1909, see under "South Africa."

Railways.

The railways are worked under the name of the Central South African Railways, and administered by a railway board of five members, three of whom are nominated by the Transvaal Government, and two by the Orange River Colony Government.

The railway system in the Colony consists of:

(1) A main line connecting the Cape Colony ports of Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London with the Transvaal, running from Mid Norvals Pont Bridge and Mid Bethulie Bridge to Mid Vaal River Bridge, a distance of 334 miles from Mid Norvals Pont Bridge, the line from East London connecting at Springfontein, a distance from Mid Bethulie Bridge of 28 miles.

(2) The following branch lines:—Springfontein to Fauresmith (57 miles); Hamilton Junction to Beaconsfield (Cape Border) (100 miles); Hamilton Junction to Tempe (Cantonnons (4 miles); Bloemfontein to Bethlehem (188 miles); Modderpoort to Ladybrand (7 miles); Marseilles to Maseru (16 miles); Smaldeel Junction to Winburg (28 miles); Dover to Parys (20 miles); Wolvehoek to Heilbron (31 miles); Vierfontein to Eastleigh in the Transvaal (10 miles) connecting with the Klerksdorp-Fourteen Streams line, making a total of 823 miles.

To these must be added a line from the Natal border to Kroonstad Junction (178 miles), worked by the Natal Government.

It is also contemplated to construct a line from Wepener to a point on the Bloemfontein-Modderpoort line (about 60 miles), when all parts of the Colony, with the exception of the Vrede district, will be within fairly easy reach of the railway.

Climate.

The Orange River Colony can be separated, roughly, into three divisions—viz., the western, the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile, but requires irrigation.

The middle division, through which the railway runs, holds moisture longer than the western division, and will grow certain crops without irrigation. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock.

The eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe.

The heat, especially in the middle and western divisions, is great during the months of December, January, and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea, often rising on individual days to 106° and 108° Fahr. at 12 noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 76° and the mean minimum 45°.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein:

| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May. | June |
|------|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 4°04 | 2°33 | 2°87 | 1°88  | 1°01 | 0°54 |

| 0°44 | 0°42 | 0°87 | 1°37  | 1°32 | 2°33 |

Total for Year ... ... 20°02

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

Public Works.

The new Law Courts and new University College buildings and an extensive Hostel have been completed at the capital and are now in occupation.

Funds have been provided for a programme of useful buildings throughout the Colony, amongst which the principal work is the reconstruction of the Government offices, which were partially destroyed by fire in October, 1908. This building will be considerably improved in appearance and construction, and will conform with the probable development of the Civil Administration under the coming Union. An Appeal Court is being provided in the newly constructed Law Courts buildings.

Attention is also being given to the provision of country schools and housing of the Police Administration, structures for which have mostly been of a temporary nature.

Currency and Banking.

British sterling and the gold of the late South African Republic are legal tender, and accounts are kept in British sterling.

Under the law of the late Orange Free State the National Bank of the Orange River Colony (in which the Government is represented by 70,000£ out of the total share capital of 100,000£), and the Bank of Africa were the only ones that were legally entitled to transact business in the Colony, but banking has since been made free for all banks obtaining the permission of the Government to open branches. The banks at present represented are the National Bank, the Standard Bank, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, the National Bank of South Africa, Natal Bank, and the Netherlands Bank of South Africa.

Notes of all the above banks are in circulation in the Colony.

Industries.

The leading industry of the country is agriculture, inclusive of stock and sheep-farming. The output of coal has decreased from 524,487 tons for 1907-8 to 470,590 tons for 1908-9. The decrease is due to loss of railway contracts during the year. There is an increase in the output of diamonds from 505,452 cts. in 1907-8 to 654,319 cts. in 1908-9, but there has been a slight decrease in the value of from 1,651,725£ to 1,048,608£. This decrease was due to the crisis in the diamond trade.
Land Settlement.

The 1908-9 season has been favourable for agriculturists, and settlers have generally improved their position. The stock census return for 1908 showed an increase of over 59,000 sheep, over 2,287 cattle, and other stock in proportion, from the previous twelve months. Up to 30th September, 1909, there were 642 heads of families, of which 570 are British and 72 Dutch. The new Land Board, appointed by H.E. The Governor under the terms of Letters Patent granting responsible Government to the Colony, took up their duties on October 1st, 1907. The title deeds of 1,521,041 acres of land were transferred to the Board, the remaining unallotted and undeveloped land, amounting to 118,500 acres, passing to the control of the Government. Revenue received from settlers from October 1st, 1908, to September 30th, 1909, amounted to £47,604. Expenditure during same period in loans to settlers, development of land, administration expenses, etc., £34,695. There are over 200 approved applicants waiting for any available land under the control of the Board.

Education.

The educational policy of the Government is administered through the Education Department. From 1900 to 1905 the schools were managed, teachers were selected and appointed, and all expenditure was borne by the Government. Local Education Committees were established in the towns in 1903, but these were merely advisory bodies. In terms of an agreement come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church in March, 1905, the Christian National Schools, which had been started a year previously, were amalgamated with the Government Schools.

In 1908 a new School Act was passed and came into force on the 1st November. The principal changes introduced by this Act are as follows:

Fees are payable in respect of pupils at all primary and secondary public schools and aided private schools, provision being made for exemption in necessitous cases. English and Dutch are put on an equal footing as media of instruction in the various subjects of the curriculum, certain modifications being permitted according to circumstances during the first three years after the taking effect of the Act. With the exception of certain high schools, every primary and secondary public school is placed under the supervision of a committee consisting of five or seven members (according to the size and importance of the school) elected by the parents of children attending such school. The central local control in each district is vested in the District Board, which consists of nine members, the bare majority of whom are elected by the committees within the district, and the rest appointed by the Minister in charge of Education. Religious instruction can only be given by members of the school staff, and dogmatic teaching is prohibited during school hours, except in country schools when parents request that such instruction be given.

On the termination of hostilities in 1902 the total number of pupils attending permanent schools in the Orange River Colony was 1,933. Many children were then receiving instruction in the refugee camp schools. In June, 1903, when all the refugee camps had been broken up, the numbers in attendance at town and country schools in the Colony were 9,031. In 1909 the roll was 18,863.

Students are prepared for the B.A. and M.A. degrees, Law, Survey, Engineering and Pharmacy Examinations at Grey University College, Bloemfontein, new buildings for which are now in course of erection on an extensive site in the west of the city, where the Grey College School and hostels are already in operation.

A normal school in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination held annually in April.

There is also an industrial school in Bloemfontein where orphans and sons of poor parents are maintained and supervised at Government expense, and apprenticed to various trades and industries in the town.

Courses of instruction are also given in agriculture at Grey College, in household economy at Eunice High School, and in cookery, dressmaking, art needlework and millinery in Bloemfontein and at various other centres in the Colony.

Spinning and weaving schools have also been started recently, and have met with considerable measure of success.

The above statement refers to the education and training of white people only. A small grant is also given annually in aid of the education of natives. This grant is paid to the various religious denominations which undertake the work of native education, and the amount is in proportion to the number of children in the schools. There are about 10,000 native children in these schools.

The Department of Education sustained a severe and irreparable loss in the fire at Government buildings, Bloemfontein, on the 28th October of this year. Its offices were completely destroyed, and all books, correspondence and other valuable records perished in the flames.
