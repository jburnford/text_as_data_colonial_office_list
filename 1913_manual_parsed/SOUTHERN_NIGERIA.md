SOUTHERN NIGERIA.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria lies in that deep recess in the coast line of West Africa which is washed by the Gulf of Guinea, some five degrees north of the Equator, and is bounded on the north by the British Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the east by the German dependency of the Cameroons and on the west by the French possession of Dahomey. Its area is estimated at 79,880 square miles or nearly two-thirds that of the United Kingdom. The total population is returned at 7,857,983.

Constitution.

By Royal Letters Patent dated 28th of February, 1906, the Colony of Southern Nigeria was formed, and was amalgamated with the Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate under one Administration, with the style of the "Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria," with headquarters at Lagos. Southern Nigeria is to be amalgamated or federated with Northern Nigeria in the near future.

The Government is administered by a Governor assisted by an Executive and Legislative Council, the latter consisting of nine official and six unofficial members.

Administration.

For purposes of administration, Southern Nigeria is divided into three provinces, namely: the Western, or Lagos, Province comprising the former Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate, with headquarters at Lagos; the Central, or Niger, Province with headquarters at Warri; and the Eastern, or Calabar, Province with headquarters at Calabar; the two latter provinces comprising what was formerly known as the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Each province is presided over by a Provincial Commissioner and divided into districts under the charge of District Commissioners and Assistant District Commissioners.

Law and Justice.

The laws in force in the old Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and the old Colony and Protectorate of Lagos were codified and consolidated in 1908, and published in two volumes under a Statute Law Revision Ordinance.

The Supreme Court for the whole Colony and Protectorate, presided over by the Chief Justice, holds assizes at the principal centres. There are District Courts, with limited criminal and civil jurisdiction, presided over by Commissioners, and there are Police Magistrates' Courts with similar jurisdiction at Lagos, Warri and Calabar.

The Supreme Court decides appeals from the inferior courts in civil matters, and the Chief Justice has power of revision of the decision of Commissioners in criminal cases. The Chief Justice and Puise Judges are, ex officio, Puise Judges of the Supreme Courts of Northern Nigeria, while the Chief Justice and Puise Judges of Northern Nigeria are, ex officio, Puise Judges of the Supreme Court of Southern Nigeria.

Native Councils and courts have been established throughout the districts in the Central and Eastern Provinces. The District Commissioner sits as president of the court, and in his absence the Assistant District Commissioner.
The courts have, subject to the approval of the Governor, power to make rules providing for the peace, good order and welfare of the natives. Native law is administered in all the courts in so far as it is not incompatible with any statute and not repugnant to natural justice.

Post and Telegraph.

| To the United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies | 1d. | ½d. |
| Other Postal Union Countries | 2½d. per oz. above. | ½d. |

Parcels to and from the United Kingdom and British Colonies in West Africa, 3 lbs. 1s., 7 lbs. 2s., 11 lbs. 3s.

Foreign Money Order systems are in operation with the United Kingdom, and countries served thereby, Northern Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and the German West African Colonies, and orders are issued for sums up to 40l. at a commission of 4d. per l.

Inland Money Order and Parcel Post systems are also in operation. The commission on Inland Money Orders is 3d. per l. The rates on Inland Parcels are 7d., 1½d. and 1s. 3d. for 3 lbs., 7 lbs. and 11 lbs respectively. There is also an Inland Registration system under which compensation to the extent of 120l. can be secured on prepayment of fees ranging from 2½d. to 8d.

A Cash on Delivery Service is in operation with the United Kingdom and certain British possessions. It is for the present confined to the offices at Lagos, Calabar, Warri, Forcados, Bonny, Opobo, and Ibadan, and the value of a packet is limited to 20l.

British Postal Orders are issued and paid throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

An Inland Government Telegraph system has now been successfully completed, whereby telegraphic communication is rendered possible between the chief centres of the whole Colony and Protectorate, without having recourse to the cable which runs from Lagos to Bonny in the Eastern Province.

There are 80 Telegraph Offices open including telegraph stations along the railway line from Lagos, via Ibadan, to Jebba in Northern Nigeria. The principal telegraphic stations in the Western Province are Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Oshogbo, Oyo, Ilesha and Epe; and those in the Central and Eastern Provinces are Ifon, Benin City, Sapele, Warri, Burutu, Forcados, Onitsha, Oguta, Owerri, Itu, Calabar, Eket, Opobo and Bonny.

Telegraph rate is ½d. per word in the Western Province with a minimum charge of 6½d., and in the Central and Eastern Provinces 1d. per word with a minimum of 1s.

1,800 miles of line are open, with 4,000 miles of wire. Further extensions are in progress.

Public Telephone exchanges are in operation at Lagos, Calabar, Opobo, and Warri, and small systems of telephonic communication are established at Abeokuta, Aro, Ibadan, Oshogbo, Onitsha, Bonny, Afikpo, and Obubra.

The African Direct Telegraph Company maintain cable communication at Bonny and Lagos, which places all the Government Telegraph Offices in touch with all parts of the globe.

Education.

The Headquarters of the Director of Education are in Lagos. Each province has an education office under a Provincial Inspector of Schools, though that office in the Western Province has been merged into the headquarters office. There are three Junior Inspectors and a number of European schoolmasters. There is a Board of Education with advisory powers in each province. Education is not compulsory. The total number of Government schools is 60, of which 9 are in the Western Province, 27 and 22 in the Central and Eastern Provinces respectively. The number of pupils on the roll in Government schools amount to 5,500, with an average attendance 3,500. The number of assisted schools 115. The number on the roll of assisted schools is 14,000, with an average attendance of 10,000.

In addition to the above schools a high grade secondary school has been established in Lagos by the Government, and is called the King's College. This school was built and equipped at a cost of nearly 10,000l. Pupils are prepared for London Matriculation, and a branch for instruction in commercial subjects has been instituted.

There are a number of Mohammedan schools in the Colony, but the instruction at these schools is chiefly confined to the Koran.

Several private secondary schools, which are not inspected by the Government, are in existence in the Western Province.

A new code, is in force, and provides, in addition to primary and secondary education, for manual, industrial, and vernacular education.

There is a large residential Government school at Bonny in the Eastern Province, provided with a technical and industrial department, where carpentering, cooperating and other crafts are taught.

There is a High School at Calabar under the management of the United Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland, styled the Hope-Waddell Institute. This school is in receipt of substantial assistance from the Government.

The Roman Catholic Mission, besides extending its work on the River Niger, has erected boys' and girls' schools at Calabar, whilst the Industrial School of this Mission at Onitsha is doing excellent work. In addition to the above a number of schools are conducted by the Church Missionary Society, the Niger Delta Pastorate Mission, the Primitive Methodist Mission, and the Onitsha Industrial Mission.

Climate and Health.

West Africa has always had, and deserved, the reputation of being so unhealthy that almost certain death would be the fate of the white man who endeavoured to make it his home. And in this general condemnation Southern Nigeria has been included. Though it cannot be claimed, even at the present day, that the country is a healthy one for the European in any circumstances, it should be realised that the conditions of living have been so greatly improved during recent years that the possibilities of the place for his temporary residence have been enormously increased. Medical and sanitary engineering science have effected much in this way, especially by anti-malaria precautions through
the use of mosquito-proof houses and anti-mosquito crusades, the correct use of quinine, and in the reclaiming of large areas of swamp lands by the Government, at great expense, during the last few years. In spite of this undoubted improvement in the conditions of life, however, it cannot yet be said that Southern Nigeria is a land which can ever be colonised by Europeans in raising generations of white people, and thereby populating the country, as in the cases of South Africa, Australia, and elsewhere.

Southern Nigeria may be divided into wet and dry zones comprising, respectively, territory south and north of 6°15' north latitude with, roughly, a total yearly rainfall, in the one case of above, and in the other below, 76 inches. There are four seasons—the wet, the dry, and two tornado seasons. The wet zone, in this respect, is about a month behind the dry zone. The dry season may be said to begin about November, lasting till March, when the first tornado season occurs, whilst the wet season lasts from about May to July, followed by the second tornado season. During the months of December and January a cold north-east wind, known as the Harmattan, prevails, and is accompanied by fog.

The mean temperature at the Lagos observatory in 1911 was 79.6°, the highest shade temperature being 93.3° in month of July, and the lowest 66° in month of January.

The rainfall in Lagos in 1910 was 69.43 inches, and varied from 41.43 to 148.92 inches in different parts of the country.

Trade.

Southern Nigeria throughout is agricultural, and, as a kindred industry, forestry is of great and growing importance. The monarch of the Nigerian forest is, of course, the oil palm, but the country possesses an extremely valuable asset in its mahogany and rubber trees.

The soil under cultivation yields good crops of cotton, cocoa, maize, cassava, yams, ground nuts, etc. Of these the first three are exported. The mineral resources of the country are being explored by a special Mineral Survey now in progress.

The following table indicates the quantity and value of the principal exports in 1911.

| Article       | Quantity          | Value     |

Currency and Banking.

All coins which, under the Coinage Acts, 1870 and 1891, are legal tender in the United Kingdom, and all subsidiary coins coined in pursuance of the provisions of His Majesty's Order in Council dated 28th July, 1906, and the amendment of the 9th September, 1907, are current in all parts of the Colony. The tender of payment of money in any part of the Colony in any of these coins, if the coins have not been illegally dealt with, or, when of gold, have not become diminished in weight by wear or otherwise so as to be of less weight than the weights specified in that behalf in the First Schedule of the Coinage Act, 1870, as the least current weight, are a legal tender, in the case of gold and silver coins for the payment of any amount, and in the case of bronze coins or of the subsidiary coins, for the payment of any amount not exceeding one shilling. The subsidiary coins put into circulation during 1908 are the nickel bronze penny, and the nickel tenth of a penny.

In 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged into a company named the Bank of British West Africa, and has now established branches at Calabar, Burutu, and Onitsha.

Means of Communication.

The Port of Lagos 4,279 miles from Liverpool, is situated on a lagoon into which large mail and cargo steamers cannot at present enter. The bar, however, is being dredged and harbour works carried out which will, it is hoped, enable ocean going steamers to enter the port. The other principal ports are Sapele, Warri, Forcados, Burutu, Akassa, Brass, Degema, Bonny, Opobo and Calabar.

The British and African Steamship Company and the African Steamship Company, both controlled by Messrs. Elder Dempster & Co., of Water Street, Liverpool, have a weekly mail service to Forcados calling at Lagos, 16 days from Liverpool, and a weekly service to Calabar and ports east of Forcados. The fares from Liverpool to Lagos are 30l. 16s. 1st class and 22l. 11s. 2nd class, and 33l. 1st class and 24l. 15s. 2nd class to Forcados and ports east of it. At present mails and passengers are landed at Lagos in a branch boat, heavy cargo, as a rule, being transhipped at Forcados and returned from thence in a boat of sufficiently light draught to cross Lagos bar. The Woermann Line runs regularly from Hamburg, calling at Boulogne. Elder Dempster & Co. have a service of branch boats between Lagos and Forcados; and both Elder Dempster and the Woermann Line have an intermediate service to the various ports in Southern Nigeria. There is water communication for launches between Lagos and the Niger delta, and the Government has a limited water transport on the Niger and Cross Rivers of which the public can make use. There is also a regular weekly service from Lagos to Badagri to the west and to Epe and Siluko to the east of Lagos, as well as a launch mail service between Bonny, Brass, and Akassa via Degema and between Bonny and Opobo. (Communications are also referred to under the Western Province, and also under the Central and Eastern Provinces.)

**THE WESTERN OR LAGOS PROVINCE.**

**Situation and Boundaries.**

The Western, or Lagos Province, is situated on the Bight of Benin, and extends from the boundary line of Dahomey on the west, to that of the Central Province on the east, while from the sea coast it extends northward, so as to include all the Yoruba country with the exception of Illorin, to the confines of Northern Nigeria.

It contains that part of Southern Nigeria known as the “Colony.” The “Colony,” as distinguished from the “Colony and Protectorate,” for the most part extends from the coast line for a comparatively short distance inland, and comprises the District of Lagos, portions of the Districts of Badagri, Epe*, and Ikorodu.

The total area of the province is approximately 28,600 square miles, while that of the Colony alone is 4,000 square miles. The population of the whole province is returned at 2,152,776.

**Administrative Divisions.**

For administrative purposes the province is divided into the following districts, which include the independent native state of Egbaland: Abeokuta, Badagri, Epe*, Ibadan, Ikorodu, Ilesha, Ijebu Ode, Lagos, Meko*, Ondo, Oshogbo (sub-district), Oyo* and Shaki.

**History.**

Koeko, the king of Lagos, having refused to co-operate in suppressing the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his uncle Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye’s son and successor, king Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown in consideration of a pension of 1,000l. a year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

By Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863, the territories were erected into a separate Government.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West African Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further Letters Patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

By Letters Patent dated 28th February, 1906, already referred to, Lagos was amalgamated with Southern Nigeria.

In 1862, Palma and Lekki became British, and in 1863 Badagri was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Kotonu, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the Protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Kotonu, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the Protectorate was, in 1886, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mabiri, and of the Ogbo and Jekri territories.

In 1890, Kotonu was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagri.

In 1891 the kingdoms of Igbesa, Ado, and Ilaro were included in the Protectorate, and in 1894 Ijebu Remo was similarly dealt with, Mahin, Itebu, Ibu, and Aiyesan being proclaimed Protectorate in 1895.

An expedition was sent against the Ijebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Protectorate of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

Ikorodu was ceded in August, 1894, and by an Order in Council, issued at the end of 1899, the Protectorate was extended to the boundaries of Northern Nigeria and to the Protectorate then known as Southern Nigeria.

**Native Tribes.**

The people inhabiting the Lagos or Western Province may be grouped into three main divisions:

1. The Jejis (to adopt Bouche’s name) or Effona. This includes the natives of Dahomey, the Popos, Porto Novans, and other tribes.

2. The Yoruba race. The word “Yoruba” is used in two senses, firstly as indicating the tribe of Yoruba proper under the Alafin of Oyo, and secondly as a language, and even sometimes for all the numerous tribes speaking that language. Using the word in this last sense the Yoruba race may be said to include, beside the Yoruba proper (the Oyos), the Egbas, the Ijebus, the Ifes, the Aworis, the Ijeshas, the Ekitis, the Ekos or Lagosians, and the Eghados.

3. The Benins or Binis, including the Jekris and Mahins. What affinity there may be in

* The Yoruba place names Epe, Meko, and Oyo are pronounced Ehpeh, Mrkkaw, and Awyaw.
race or language between these people and the Yorubas is not yet determined.

The Jeji race are to be found in the Meko and Badagri Districts, where they merge gradually into the Yoruba tribes.

The Yoruba-speaking race is by far the most important of the three. The western limit of this people appears to be somewhere about the Anglo-French boundary, but near the border the races become much mixed. There are, for example, a considerable number of Popos, who are of the Jeji race, in Badagri and in the villages on the lagoon in the Badagri District. The inhabitants of the Mahin and Jekri countries, who are probably of the Bini race, the Binis and the people of Ifon, Owo, and Ajyede roughly mark the eastern limit of the Yoruba-speaking people. On the north they extend as far as the 9th degree of latitude.

The Binis, Jekris, and Mahins inhabit the most eastern portion of the Epe, and the eastern border of the Ondo Districts. The Binis and Jekris, a small portion of whose country only is in the Western Province, are generally considered as natives of the Central Province.

The population of the island and town of Lagos is very mixed, and in addition to the Ekos or Lagosians, it comprises a considerable number of practically every Yoruba-speaking tribe, as well as immigrants from Sierra Leone, the Gambia, the Gold Coast, Liberia (Kroomen), Hausas, etc.

Trade.

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, brickmaking, pottery, bead work, ivory carving, and the working of iron.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the inland waters, the fish being dried and sent up into the interior.

Cotton planting has been commenced under the auspices of the Government, and the prospects are encouraging.

The British Cotton Growing Association have, now, by arrangement with the Colonial Office, taken over the management of the industry, and very considerable tracts of land at Ilugun, near Ibadan, and between Aro and Abeokuta, have been drained, cleaned and planted.

A small sugar mill has also been erected at Agbowa, in the Colony, and there seems a possibility that the sugar-cane may be extensively grown.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, and mahogany; the chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France.

Chief Towns.

Lagos Town, situated on the island of the same name, is the seat of Government, and has, including Iddo and Ebute Metta, a population of about 73,000; this number includes, roughly, 500 Europeans, which comprises officials, merchants, missionaries and a few ladies. It is one of the largest and most up-to-date towns in West Africa and forms the only port along 1,000 miles of coast. Lagos has unrivalled inland water communication to the east and west by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Sierra Leone, 132 miles from Forcados, and 396 miles from Calabar.

Ibadan. A large and important place. Population 175,000 natives and 50 Europeans.

Abeokuta, the capital of Egbaland, an independent native state, has a population of 51,000, including 30 to 40 Europeans.

Oyo, population 45,000. Ijebu Ode, population 22,000. Ilesha, population 16,000. Epe, population 8,000. Ondo, population 24,000. Badagri, population 7,000. Ikorodu, population 12,000. All the above towns are the headquarters of administrative districts of the same name.

Other important towns are Oshogbo (sub-district headquarters) Iwo, Ife, Ikirun, Ogobomosho, Ede, and Ila with inhabitants numbering from 80,000 to 18,000 each.

Means of Communication.

In March, 1901, the present Government railway was opened and extended from Iddo Island, which lies between Lagos Island and the mainland, to Ibadan, a distance of 123½ miles.

Recent construction has added another 182½ miles of open line, reaching Jebba in Northern Nigeria territory.

From Jebba the line was carried to a point about 25 miles beyond Zungeru (about 145 from Jebba), where a junction takes place with the pioneer line constructed by the Northern Nigeria Government, from Baro (on the Niger, 130 miles below Jebba) to Zaria and Kano, large commercial centres in the north of Northern Nigeria. The Niger is to be crossed at Jebba by a bridge to Jebba Island, and by another bridge over the northern channel of the river.

The railway terminus is on Iddo Island, which is connected by bridges with the mainland and with Lagos Island.

These bridges are the Carter Road Bridge, which extends from Lagos to Iddo Island and is 2,500 feet long, carried on steel screw piles some 100 feet long; and the Denton Railway and Road Bridge, connecting Iddo Island with the mainland and 900 feet long. A steam tramway runs between Lagos and Iddo railway station.

There are many fine roads constructed in the various districts of the Western Province.

During the year 1907 a Government road motor transport service of three Lacre cars and a Thornycroft lorry was inaugurated between Oyo and Ibadan, a distance of 35 miles, and further road extension is in progress and in contemplation to develop motor traffic. This pioneer service has proved very popular, and has already decreased the cost of transport by at least 50 per cent. These motor services are expected to act as feeders of traffic to the railway, and will be replaced by branch railway lines as soon as the traffic developed on any road warrants the large capital expenditure required for constructing a railway line.

Extensive harbour works are in progress with a view to making Lagos an open port. At the end of August, 1912, 6,000 feet of the Eastern Training Mole had been completed and the Western Mole was well under way.

The Central and Eastern Provinces lie to the south-east of the Western Province; from that division they extend eastwards for some 270 miles to the Anglo-German boundary, and from the sea-board on the south-west and south to parallel of north latitude 7° 8'. Thus, they are bounded on the north by Northern Nigeria, on the south by the sea, on the east by the Cameroons, and on the west by the sea and the Western Province.

The area of the Central Province is 22,670 square miles, while that of the Eastern is 28,610 square miles. Conjunctively they have a population of 5,706,207.

Administrative Divisions.

For administrative purposes the Central Province is divided into the following districts:—Abo, Agbor, Asaba, Awka, Benin, Forcados, Idah, Ifon, Ubiaja, Kwale, Onitsha, Okwowa, Sapele, Udi, and Warri; and the Eastern Province as follows:—Abe, Abak, Abakaliki, Afikpo, Ahoada, Aro Chuku, Bende, Bonny, Brass, Calabar, Degema, Eket, Ikom, Ikot Ekpene, Oban, Obubra, Obudu, Ogoja, Okigwi, Opobo, Owerri and Uyo.

History.

The British Protectorate of the Niger districts (Oil Rivers Protectorate) was announced in the London Gazette of 5th June, 1885. It extended along the West Coast of Africa from a point on the shore of the Bight of Benin about ten miles north-west of the Benin River to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger was included in the territories administered by the Royal Niger Company under their Charter of 10th July, 1886.

By an Order in Council, dated the 13th May, 1893, the Protectorate was extended under the name of the Niger Coast Protectorate, and an administration established under Sir Claude MacDonald, K.C.M.G., K.C.B., as Imperial Commissioner and Consul-General; he was succeeded in this office, in 1896, by Sir R. Moor, K.C.M.G.

On the taking over of the territories of the Royal Niger Company in 1900 the Niger Coast Protectorate was extended so as to include the part lying between Idah on the Niger and the Coast, which had been formerly administered by the Company, and the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, was constituted under an Order in Council, dated the 27th December, 1899, the administration being transferred from the Foreign to the Colonial Office.

By Royal Letters Patent (already referred to under Western Province), dated 28th February, 1906, the Central and Eastern Provinces, then the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, were amalgamated with the Colony and Protectorate of Lagos.

Native Tribes.

The natives of the Central and Eastern Provinces of Southern Nigeria belong to several very distinct tribes, of which the following are the most important:—The Binis, Sobos, Jekris, Igaras, Ibos, Kwas, Ijaws, Ibibios, Efiks, and Munchis.

The Binis occupy the country north of the 6th parallel, stretching to, and extending over, the boundary of the Lagos Province on the west, reaching as far as Agbor on the east, and the Ifon-Ishan district boundary on the north.

The Sobos inhabit the inland country of the Sapele and Warri Districts, are traders in palm oil and kernels and are agriculturists.

The Jekris occupy the lower part of the Benin River, part of the Warri branch of the Niger, and the western portion of the Wain district.

The Igaras country was at one time an important kingdom, extending over considerably more ground than it does at present. Kakanda, Igbira-Panda and Doma used to be its tributaries. These old limits must, however, be considered merely as representing the area within which the Atta or King could rob or pillage with comparative impunity, and not as indicating his rule or jurisdiction. The Igaras now extend as a distinct tribe from a little below Idah, on the left bank of the Niger to Etobe, some 25 miles north, and about 50 miles inland from the river, and are, therefore, partly in Southern and partly in Northern Nigeria. Beyond these limits they are to be found, but merely as elements of a mixed population, in which their language and their special customs have been either lost or distorted.

The Ibos are an important tribe inhabiting a large tract of country on both banks of the Niger, and stretching eastward as far as the Cross River. The northern limit on the west of the Niger is somewhere about Illushi, while on the east of the river it extends to 6° 45' north latitude; the southern boundary is about Agberi or the Warri River.

South of the Ibos and east of the Opobo River are the Kwas, who inhabit the lower part of that river—on its left bank—and the lower part of the Kwa-Ibo River, and are connected closely in race and language with the people of the lower Cross River.

The Ijaws are an important people, who occupy the large portion of the Niger Delta, east of the Middleton River, south of the Warri and the Ibo country, and west of the Andoni (the river between the Bonny and main Niger). They have also a colony on the right bank of the Opobo River, which was founded there by Ja Ja.

The Ibibios occupy the right bank of the Cross River, from its mouth upwards, to Itu and the River Enyong or, in other words, the districts of Eket, Uyo and Ikot Ekpene.

The left bank of the Cross River, from its mouth upwards, to beyond Itu is occupied by the prominent Efik tribe. They are descended from the Ibibios on the opposite bank.

The Munchis inhabit a large area of country lying partly in Northern Nigeria and partly in Southern Nigeria, in about north latitude 7° and east longitude 9°. They are an important and warlike people.

Trade.

The staple product of the Central and Eastern Provinces is, and always has been, palm oil. The country is so bountifully endowed by nature with palm oil and kernels that there is little or nothing for the natives to do beyond the manual labour of gathering the fruit, and preparing in their primitive way the oil and kernels for trading purposes. The other principal articles of export are cocoa, coffee, ebony, fibre, gum-copal, ground nuts, ivory and rubber. The imports are much the same as those of the Western Province.
Chief Towns.

In the Central Province.—Warri. A most important place and the headquarters of the Central Province. The population consists of Ijaws and Sobos, with a small but influential element of Jekris. There are about 60 Europeans and 3,000 natives.

Onitsha. The district headquarters, and a most important and growing place, both from an administrative and commercial point of view, is situated on the left bank of the River Niger, just below its confluence with the Anambra River. The population is about 12,000, of which 5,000 inhabit the waterside part of the town and the remainder Onitsha Town proper.

Benin City. The headquarters of the Benin District. The town was formerly the seat of a powerful monarchy, and notorious for the terrible human sacrifices carried out by the fetish priests. In 1897, a combined naval and military expedition was sent against it to avenge the massacre of Europeans and their native followers, who were on their way to visit the place on a peace mission. Since these events, however, the people have settled down, and the town has become a very important trading centre. The population is for the most part Bini, though there are a large number of Yorubas and a few odd members of various tribes. The population is 10,000.

Asaba. At one time the capital of the Niger Company's territories and now the headquarters of the district of the same name. The population is 27,000.

Sapele. The district headquarters. The population is 2,000.

Forcados and Burutu. Forcados is situated on the left bank and near the mouth of the river of the same name. The river is the principal waterway connecting the main Niger with the sea, and the town is the chief port for the Western and Central Provinces. Five miles above the anchorage on the same bank lies Burutu, which is the receiving port for, and an enclave of the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria. The population of Forcados is 3,000, and of Burutu 2,000, the population consists mainly of Jekri, Sobo, and Ijaw people.

Other important places in the Central Province are Abo, Agbor, Awka, Idah, Ifon, Ubija, Kwale, Okwoga, and Udi, all of which are district headquarters.

Chief towns in the Eastern Province.—Calabar. The headquarters of the Eastern Province, and at one time the seat of Government of Southern Nigeria, is situated on the left bank of the Calabar River, a few miles above its junction with the Cross River. Calabar has a population of 14,000 natives and 150 Europeans.

Opobo (including Opobo town). The district headquarters is situated on both banks of the Opobo River, in a most thriving trade district. The population is 19,000, and comprises Ibos, Kwas and Ogonis, while there are 50 Europeans in the locality.

Degema. The district headquarters and an important trade centre; lies on the left bank of the River Sombrero, about 30 miles from its mouth. In Degema and its neighbourhood there are three classes of native population—the Calabaris, the Okrikas, and the Ibos, of whom there are several branches. The estimated number of inhabitants of Degema and the immediate neighbourhood, is 4,000.

Bonny. The district headquarters and an important trading place. The population consists of 3,000 natives, who are of the Ibo tribe.

Brass. The district headquarters is situated at the mouth of the Brass River, and about 72 miles west of Bonny. The approximate number of inhabitants is 1,000.

Other important places in the Eastern Province are Aba, Abakaliki, Afikpo, Ahoada, Aro Chuku, Bende, Eket, Ikom, Ikot Ekpene, Oban, Obubra, Obudu, Ogoja, Okigwi, Owerri, and Uyo, all of which are district headquarters.

Native Currency.

The native currency of brass rods and manillas is accepted as legal tender in native markets in which they were current previous to the introduction of the Native Currency Proclamation (1902), the rates of exchange being for Brass Rods 4 to 1s., Atorine Manillas 16 to 1s., for Awirawu Manillas 6 to 1s., for Abbie or Prince Manillas, 12 to 1s. and Ama-Ogono or Town Manillas, 24 to 1s., and for Perkule Manillas 4 to 1s. In the Calabar and Cross River districts there are also in circulation copper wires, known as "Citims," the rates of exchange being 20 to 3d. (one brass rod) or 80 to 1s. Cowries are still used as currency in some parts, but further importation is prohibited, and the abolition of the native currency is being gradually effected.

Means of Communication.

The great natural highway for traffic in the Central Province, at the present time, is the Niger River, which in its course to the sea throws out a veritable network of waterways which are navigable for native and other shallow-draft craft. And it may be taken that, however perfect the railway system may be in years to come, these natural means of transport will always remain a vast convenience to the country, and, on account of the able manner in which the natives can negotiate them, will enable the Niger and other waterways to hold their own against the railway for the internal transport of many of the purely native products. Within recent years the Government have spent large sums in the clearing of these waterways.

The Cross River, in the Eastern Province, is navigable up to and beyond the German boundary during the wet season by small steamers and launches, but during the dry season, mails and Government cargo can only be conveyed by means of canoes. The distance from Calabar to Ossidinge, beyond the German boundary, is about 242 miles. A system of regular transport for passengers and cargo at fixed rates is maintained during the wet season.

Another feature has been the making of the roads connecting towns in the interior with one another and with these waterways. In this way huge strides have been made in opening up the country, and developments will become more marked every year.
