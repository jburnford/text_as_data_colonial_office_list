WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877, for the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and to provide a Civil Court for the settlement of disputes between British subjects living in these islands.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, New South Wales, or New Zealand, and not being within the jurisdiction of any civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1907, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met from Imperial funds.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner, and where the attendance of the Chief Justice or other Judge of the Supreme Court is impracticable, the High Commissioner may appoint a Judicial Commissioner for particular purposes or for a particular time.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.
The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

For the purpose of better carrying out the provisions of the Pacific Islanders' Protection Acts, 1872 and 1875, and in order to deal with cases occurring where there is no resident Deputy Commissioner, certain officers in command of His Majesty's ships of war on the Australian station have been appointed Deputy Commissioners.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

PRINCIPAL GROUPS UNDER THE HIGH COMMISSIONER.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, are situated between the 20th and 23rd degrees of south latitude. The islands are most of them of coral formation, but include some active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafoou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Sandwich Islands. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra (the dried kernel of the nut) forms the principal export. Bananas and oranges are also exported from Vavau, in the northern part of the group.
There is regular steam communication with Auckland (1,000 miles distant), Sydney (1,850 miles), and Fiji, and sailing vessels run between Tonga and Fiji (200 miles). Sailing vessels carry the copra to Europe.

The late king, George Tubou, was the first of its chiefs or kings to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, and his rule on the whole was fairly successful. The king is assisted by a native parliament and a privy council. With the exception of a few Europeans in the Customs, Education, and Medical Departments, the whole of the Government officers are Tongans. The tariff resembles that of Fiji, and licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades. The revenue and expenditure in 1911-12 amounted to £50,856, and £50,012, respectively. According to the official returns the imports and exports were:

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
|      | £ s. d. | £ s. d. |
| 1900 | 88,718 0 0 | 106,793 0 0 |
| 1901 | 64,259 0 0 | 88,008 0 0 |
| 1904 | 60,295 0 0 | 86,425 0 0 |
| 1905 | 76,868 0 0 | 110,728 0 0 |
| 1906 | 79,363 0 0 | 137,583 0 0 |
| 1907 | 97,820 0 0 | 134,193 0 0 |
| 1908 | 98,650 0 0 | 133,756 0 0 |
| 1909 | 152,870 14 9 | 217,155 3 10 |
| 1910 | 160,643 9 11 | 245,946 7 3 |
| 1911 | 182,121 19 10 | 240,103 13 4 |

but the value of the copra exported in the years previous to 1904 is about 20 per cent. too high. The shipping in 1911 was 208,765 tons. The native population is about 21,000; the European about 600. The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are five churches, viz., the Wesleyan Mission Church (established over 60 years), with at present about 3,000 adherents only; the Wesleyan "Free Church of Tonga," with about 15,000 adherents; the Roman Catholic, with about 3,000 adherents; the "Free Church of England," founded by Mr. Shirley Baker, the number of whose adherents is unknown; and the Church of England recently established by Dr. Willis, late Anglican Bishop of Honolulu. The Free Church of Tonga was established in 1885, and considerable persecution was inflicted on the adherents of the Mission Church, generally styled "Fakaogo," i.e., subordinate to a foreign Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Waldemar Baker, the Premier, an ex-Wesleyan missionary. Six persons charged with complicity in the attempt were shot. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church, whose houses were pillaged, and who were beaten with clubs and whips till they declared their adhesion to the "Free Church." About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren inhospitable islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaogo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he, in accordance with the power conferred on the High Commissioner by the Western Pacific Orders in Council, issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier ("Tukuaho"). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make the necessary arrangements for their return.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufashau, under the title of George Tubou II.

By the Convention of 14th November, 1899, Germany renounced all rights over Tonga Islands, including Vavau, and over Savage Island (Nieue).

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed by Mr. Thomson, in Tonga, and, by consent of the chiefs, in Savage Island also.

In December, 1904, and January, 1905, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard im Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder, and receiving an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him under the Treaty of 1890. The Premier, Josatike, Toga, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jone Mateiaiona was appointed to the Premiership, which office he has since retained. The progress of Tonga has since been very satisfactory.

All the natives are taught to read and write, and higher education is provided by colleges established by the Government and by the Wesleyan Mission.

British and foreign subjects are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

The Union Group consists of three small islands, Fakaofo, Oatafu, and Nukunono, about 9° S. latitude and 172° W. longitude. The islands are coral atolls, and the principal article of trade is copra. The natives are of Polynesian race, and are about 1,000 in number. They are ruled by their own chiefs, with the assistance of native
councils. A British Protectorate has been proclaimed over this group, which is now included, for administrative purposes, under the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorates. The inhabitants are either adherents of the London Missionary Society or Roman Catholics.

The Ellice and Gilbert Groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 5° N. latitude and 10° S. latitude, and 170° to 180° E. longitude. The principal export is copra. The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race, and number about 30,000, and are most of them now adherents either of American or British Nonconformist Missions, or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. The islands have separate kings or chiefs, who are assisted by councils of chiefs and commoners. These groups have now been placed under British protection. Courts of law have been established amongst the natives, and a revenue is obtained from native contributions and trade licences, which covers the cost of maintaining a regular government in the islands.

Ocean Island, or Paanopa, in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, was annexed and included in the jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Protectorate in 1900. It is now the site of most successful operations by the Pacific Phosphate Company, whose European employees there number about 80. The natives of the island, who are closely allied in race to the Gilbertines, numbered, in 1909, 476.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaika, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ontong-Java, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. Stations have been established by the Melanesian Mission, and by the Roman Catholics, but the converts are not numerous. The natives have been described as treacherous; some tribes are still head-hunters and cannibals. A large number of natives used to go under indenture to labour in Queensland, Fiji and Samoa. Such labourers are now excluded by law from Queensland, but some hundreds still go annually to Fiji, and a few to Samoa. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and, more lately, Burns, Philp and Co., have recently undertaken coconut planting on a large scale, and have introduced many white men for the superintendence of labour. The white population in 1908 numbered 251. The principal articles of trade are copra, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The British Resident Commissioner has his headquarters at Tulagi, a small island between Guadalcanar and Malaika, where there is a Customs House and Post Office. There are also British magistrates at the Shortland Islands, at Mala, and at Gizo. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales. By the convention between Great Britain and Germany on 14th November, 1899, Choiseul, Isabel, Shortland Island and the islands lying in Bougainville Straits came within the British sphere.

Revenue, 1907-8, £7,430l.; 1908-9, £10,603l.; 1909-10, £11,356l.; 1910-11, £14,130l.

Expenditure, 1907-8, £6,483l.; 1908-9, £13,267l.; 1909-10, £8,466l.; 1910-11, £9,493l.

| Year | Imports | Exports |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1907-8 | £49,249 | £41,694 |
| 1908-9 | £57,337 | £50,147 |
| 1909-10 | £59,300 | £57,441 |
| 1910-11 | £103,147 | £88,890 |

The Santa Cruz Islands are situated between the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides Group. The natives are Melanesians, and are mostly adherents of the Melanesian Mission. The principal trade is in copra. These islands, together with the Duff and Reef Groups, Cherry, Mitre, and Tucopia Islands, were in 1898 included in the British Solomons Protectorate, and are now subject to the Regulations under which that Protectorate is administered.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The population has been estimated at from 100,000 to 140,000, but the Mission returns place it at only 50,000. Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church. A large number of the natives are still cannibals. Life is, however, safer than in the Solomon Islands. A very few native labourers still go to New Caledonia. There is a European population of about 630, mostly British or French. A British steamer runs regularly between Sydney and the group, and a French steamer also runs from New Caledonia. The principal exports are copra, maize, and coffee, timber and sulphur are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. A joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on the 20th October, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes, British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.
British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, have now been appointed and are at work in this group, each with a staff of officers; and the buildings necessary for the various officers and for the Joint Court are in course of erection, and, for the greater part, complete.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long.), and is contiguous to the low archipelago (Tuamotu), which is under French protection. It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1780, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1873 these had increased to 76, and in 1879 to 90. The present population is about 144.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, Arthur H. Young.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn. They are reported to contain deposits of phosphate.
