SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union of South Africa is constituted under the South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, ch. 9), passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 20th September, 1909. In terms of that Act the self-governing Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony become united on the 31st day of May, 1910, in a legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa, those Colonies becoming original provinces of the Union under the names of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State respectively.

The Act constituting the Union provides for the appointment by the Sovereign of a Governor-General, who, with an Executive Council (of which the members are chosen and summoned by him), administers the executive government of the Union as the Governor-General in Council. Departments of State are established by the Governor-General in Council, the Governor-General appointing not more than ten officers to administer them. Such officers are King's Ministers of State for the Union and members of the Executive Council.

The Senate consists of forty members. For ten years after the establishment of the Union eight are nominated by the Governor-General in Council and thirty-two are elected, eight for each province. The first election was made prior to the establishment of the Union by the two Houses of each of the Colonial Legislatures sitting as one body, and a vacancy will be filled by the choice of the Provincial Council in respect of whose province a vacancy occurs.

The House of Assembly consists of 121 elected members, 51 of whom represent the Cape of Good Hope, 17 Natal, 36 Transvaal, and 17 the Orange Free State. Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent.

The qualifications of voters are the same as in the Colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership. [In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise was restricted to white men; in Natal a native could obtain a vote, but under conditions which made this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native could do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.]
Pretoria is the capital and seat of government of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Legislature.

The first Parliamentary Election under the South Africa Act was held on the 15th September, 1910, and the Union Parliament was opened by H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught, K.G.

Provinces.

A Provincial Council in each province has power to legislate by ordinance on certain subjects specified in the Act, and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. The specified subjects include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for five years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game preservation and other purely local or private matters. In addition the Union Parliament may delegate the power of making Ordinances on any subject to Provincial Councils. All ordinances passed by a Provincial Council are subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Members of the Provincial Council are elected on the same system as members of Parliament, but the restriction as to European descent does not apply. The number of members in each Provincial Council is as follows:

- Cape of Good Hope ... 51
- Natal ... 25
- Transvaal ... 36
- Orange Free State ... 25

The first Provincial elections for the Cape of Good Hope and the Transvaal were held on the 15th September, 1910; those for Natal and the Orange Free State on the 12th October, 1910.

The executive power in the subjects on which the Provincial Council is empowered to make ordinances is vested in an Executive Committee consisting of an Administrator, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and four members elected by the Provincial Council.

Climate.

Cape Province.

The climate of the Cape Province is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice is practically unknown except in the more elevated localities, particularly of the north-east. The mean annual temperature at the Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, in 33°, 56 mins. S. lat., and 18°, 29 mins. E. long., is 62°·2°; the mean maximum being 70°·8°, and the mean minimum 53°·6°; the average rainfall for the last 70 years is 25·69 inches. Cape Town itself has a mean annual temperature of 62°·6°, the mean day temperature being 71°·8° and the mean night temperature 53°·4°. Aliwal North, 30°, 41 mins. S. lat., and 26°, 40 mins. E. long. (4,330 feet above sea level), shows a mean temperature of 59°·2°, the mean maximum being 74°·2°, and the mean minimum 44°·1°; the rainfall average of 42 years being 24·0 inches. At the Royal Observatory the warmest days occur in February, when the average maximum is 80° F., and the coldest nights in July, with an average minimum of 46°·8° F.; compared with these data the average maximum temperature of the warmest month (February), in Cape Town, is 81°·8°, and the average minimum of the coldest month (July), is 47°·4°; at Aliwal North, January is the warmest month, the day temperature averaging 84°·4°, whereas in July, when the coldest nights are experienced, the mean average minimum is only 28°·7° F.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months, while along the South Coast the rainfall is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the twelve months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Natal Province.

The climate of the Natal Province varies at different levels. On the coast-line it is subtropical, but is considerably modified inland owing to increased altitude. Thus Umsinto in the South near the coast, at an altitude of 400 feet, has a mean annual temperature of 71°·8°; Durban (261 feet), 70°·8°; whilst Howick, at an elevation of 3,439 feet, has an average yearly temperature of 63°·0°. In the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced. Snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer and the sky is bright throughout the winter months. Hot winds occasionally occur towards the end of the year (September-November), when temperatures of 100° to 110° may be recorded. At Pietermaritzburg (2,200 feet) the annual temperature is 66°·6°, with an average maximum of 79°·9° and a minimum of 53°·4°. The warmest days occur in February, when the mean maximum averages 85°·3° and the coldest nights in June, when the mean minimum is 41°·3°. Again, Weenen (2,840 feet), situated in a deep cup-shaped valley, has a mean annual temperature of 66°·4°, the mean maximum being 83°·7°, and the mean minimum 49°·2°; the hottest month is January, when the mean maximum is 92°·3°, and the coldest nights are experienced in July, when the mean minimum is only 31°·4°.
The average rainfall over the Province is approximately 34 inches, being about 40 inches along the coast belt (Durban 43·45 inches) and mostly 30·35 inches inland, but decreasing to 25·5 inches at Weenen. Thunderstorms are frequent and destructive hailstorms are common during the summer months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

Transvaal Province.

Owing to the altitude (4,000 to 6,000 feet) of the plateau constituting the greater part of the Transvaal Province, the climate on the whole is healthy, cool and bracing; over the Lowveld to the North and East, however, it is hot and fever-stricken, and not at all adapted for stock owing to various endemic diseases. During summer the days are hot, occasionally exceeding 100 deg., but tempered by frequent thunderstorms, while the nights are mild to warm. During the winter months (April to September) the days are usually bright, sunny and almost cloudless, being frequently almost as warm as in summer, while the nights are cold with frequent frost and haze or fog. The rainfall is greatest in the East, Woodbush in the North-East (Zoutpansberg District) having an average of 85·06 inches in 143 days; it decreases rapidly, however, westward from the escarpment falling to 17·67 inches at Christiana in 56 days. The mean annual temperature shows considerable variation according to position and altitude; thus, Volkarsut in the South-East, near the Natal border, at an elevation of 5,300 feet, has an annual temperature of 56·9 deg., whilst Komati Poort, bordering Portuguese East Africa, at a height of only 460 feet above sea level, has an average temperature of 73·1 deg. Pretoria, the administrative capital, has an annual average temperature of 63·5 deg., with a rainfall of 29·44 inches; the warmest days there occur in December, when the mean maximum is 84·0 deg., whereas the coldest nights are met with during July, when the mean minimum is 34·8 deg. The warmest month, however, is January, with a mean of 71·8 deg., and the coldest July, with 51·7 deg. The town of Johannesburg has a mean yearly temperature of 59·9 deg., with an average rainfall of about 31 inches. Although the mean warmest month there is also January (67·5 deg.), the warmest days occur in December, when the mean maximum is 79·4 deg., and the coldest nights in July, when the mean minimum is 37·3 deg., and the monthly temperature 49·5 deg. Duststorms are frequent during the latter part of August and throughout September. Thunderstorms also are frequent during summer, more particularly from November to January, and destructive hailstorms are apt to occur at this season, destroying trees and crops. Strong, biting, cold, southerly winds blow from time to time during the winter, although the prevalent winds are mostly northerly.

Orange Free State Province.

The Orange Free State can be separated, roughly, into three divisions, viz., the Western, the Middle and the Eastern.

The Western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile. Rainfall averages 14 inches.

The Middle division, through which the main line railway runs, holds moisture longer than the Western division. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock. Rainfall averages 18 inches.

The Eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe. Rainfall averages 24 inches.

The heat, especially in the Middle and Western divisions, is great during the months of December, January and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein (altitude 4,510 feet above the sea) has risen on individual days to 102 deg. Fahr. at noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 74 deg. and the mean minimum 48 deg.

The Eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful, in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.

The following is the mean monthly and annual rainfall at Bloemfontein (Grey College) for period 1903-11:—January, 4·65 inches; February, 2·93; March, 3·97; April, 1·54; May, 1·10; June, 0·26; July, 0·22; August, 0·21; September, 0·70; October, 1·23; November, 2·60; December, 1·75. Total for year, 21·16 inches.

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

Vital Statistics.

In the Cape Province the European birth-rate in 1911 was computed to be 30·71 per 1,000, the Coloured rate at 33·00. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 10·834 per 1,000, and the Coloured rate 21·349 during the same year.

In the Transvaal Province the European birth-rate in 1911 was computed to be 36·78 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 11·92 per 1,000.

In the Orange Free State Province the European birth-rate in 1911 was computed to be 29 per 1,000. The death-rate amongst Europeans was 8 per 1,000.

Railways and Harbours.

The control and management of the railways and harbours, subject to the authority of the Governor-General in Council, are exercised through a Board consisting of a Minister of State as Chairman, and three Commissioners appointed by the Governor-General in Council.

The South African Railways include the lines of the late Central South African Railways, the Cape Government Railways and Natal Government Railways.

The open mileage at the 31st December, 1911, was:

| Province          | 3ft. 6in. Gauge | 2ft. 6in. Gauge | Total |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Cape of Good Hope | 3,159           | 2384            | 3,397 |
| Orange Free State | 1,076           | —               | 1,076 |
| Transvaal         | 1,993           | 268             | 2,020 |
| Natal             | 875             | 176             | 1,351 |
| **Total**         | **7,104**        | **441**         | **7,545** |
At the same date the open mileage of privately owned lines was 545 miles, making a total mileage in the Union of 8,091½ miles.

The total capital expended on the Government railways up to 31st December, 1911, was £79,371,654. The total revenue for the year 1911 was £12,104,769, as compared with £12,157,738 in 1910; the total working expenditure (including renewals) was £7,217,070, in 1911, or 59·6 per cent. of the gross revenue, as compared with £6,662,890, or 64·8 per cent. of the gross revenue in 1910, an increase of 4·8 per cent.

The Government issues tariff books, corrected periodically, containing full information upon all matters of interest or likely to be of service to the public, such as fares, rates, distances, running of trains, etc.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, East London and Durban. These ports are now under the direct control of the Department of Railways and Harbours.

Table Bay.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater 3,640 feet long and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 67 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 75½ acres, with about 2½ miles of berthing, and a depth ranging from 20 to 35 feet at low water. The normal capacity of the docks is 8,000 tons per diem. There is also a graving dock of 500 feet capacity on the keel blocks, with a depth of 24½ feet over the cill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T., and a slip is available for vessels up to 500 tons.

Port Elizabeth.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,180 feet long, and a third jetty, 1,460 feet long.

In addition to the above, there is an explosives jetty, 1,380 feet from the shore, with an aerial ropeway communication. This ropeway is capable of landing 150 tons per day.

East London.

The port of East London is situated at the mouth of the Buffalo River, the entrance being protected by a solid breakwater and training walls. The dock area is 100 acres in extent. Vessels drawing up to 24 feet draught and of over 8,000 tons gross register enter the river and discharge alongside the wharfs, the total length of which amounts to about 5,000 feet. A patent slip provides every facility for effecting repairs to vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight.

Durban.

Durban harbour is accessible at all times to the largest vessels navigating southern waters. The harbour is approached through the Bluff Channel, 4,000 feet in length, formed by a north pier and a south breakwater. These works are 800 feet apart, except at the pier heads, where the breadth is only 600 feet. The average low-water depth at the entrance is 33½ feet, and in the harbour channels 30 feet. The land-locked bay inside these piers extends about 3½ miles east and west, and nearly two miles north and south. The wharves have a length of 2½ miles, with depths alongside of from 23 feet to 38 feet, 6 inches L.W.O.S.T. The deep-water space available for shipping covers about one-ninth of the area, and gives a low-water depth of not less than 30 feet over its greater part.

Sea and Land Communications.

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Union Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Union (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 9 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. The distance by sea from England to the Union varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the company, under agreement with the Imperial post office.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, are also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A frequent service to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill, and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund's Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australian Steamship Company.

There is a mail Service with Mauritius and East Coast Ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.), once or twice a month and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. There are also two direct lines of Steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is 26 days.

Communication is effected between the principal towns in the Union daily; with Rhodesia, three times a week and with Lourenço Marques daily.

Mail trains leave Cape Town daily, one at 11.30 a.m. for the Transvaal via Kimberley, and the other at 8.30 p.m. for the Midland and Eastern portions of the Cape Province, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Natal. Return trains leave Pretoria daily, one at 9.30 a.m. via Kimberley, and the other at 7.45 p.m. via the Orange Free State, arriving at Cape Town at 6.55 a.m. and 6.0 p.m. respectively on the third day.

The 11.30 a.m. train from Cape Town is extended three times weekly to Vryburg, Mafeking and Bulawayo. The trains leaving Capetown on Tuesday and Friday connect at Kimberley with the "Zambesi Express," arriving at the Victoria Falls on Saturday and Tuesday. In the opposite direction the "Rhodesian Express" leaves Bulawayo on Wednesdays, Sundays and Fridays at 11.30 a.m., connecting at Kimberley with the ordinary train from the Transvaal, and arriving at Cape Town at 6.55 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday.

On Tuesday and Saturday the "Transvaal Limited" train leaves Cape Town at 9.0 a.m. for Johannesburg and Pretoria, via Kimberley, and the return trains leave Pretoria at 5.40 p.m. on Thursday and Saturday, arriving at Cape Town on Saturday and Monday at 7.30 a.m. These trains perform the journey in 36 hours.
The Imperial Mail Train-de-Luxe runs via the Orange Free State, leaving Pretoria at 5.20 p.m., and Johannesburg at 7.45 p.m. on Monday evenings, reaching Cape Town on Wednesdays at 1.50 p.m., and going through to Cape Town Docks for the convenience of passengers for the mail steamer leaving for England on that day.

On Tuesdays a train conveying the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer is despatched from the docks Cape Town to all parts of South Africa.

Mail trains leave Durban at 5.50 p.m. and 8.10 p.m. daily for Johannesburg and Pretoria. In the return direction trains leave Johannesburg at 9.30 a.m., and 8.0 p.m. daily for Durban.

Posts and Telegraphs.

At the end of 1911 there were in the Union 2,587 Post and Telegraph Offices. The number of money orders issued during the year was 484,424, and the value £2,844,676, while 370,265 orders to the value of £2,106,593 were paid. 2,919,002 postal orders, amounting to £1,962,681, were issued, and 2,194,950, valued at £1,345,772, paid.

The revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department was £1,463,915, and the expenditure £1,453,821.

On 31st December, 1911, there was a sum of £6,372,872 standing to the credit of depositors in the Post Office Savings Bank. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. Savings Bank business is transacted at all money order offices.

14,920 miles of telegraph line, carrying 55,934 miles of wire, and 47,852 miles of telephone, were opened. 9,081 miles of telegraph wire are maintained by the Post Office on behalf of the Railway Department.

Telephonic communication is established between certain of the principal centres.

There is direct overland communication with German South West Africa. Telephone call offices with Trunk facilities have been established over a greater part of the Union.

The Union is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent by the Western route, and via Zanzibar and Aden by the Eastern route, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Mauritius and Cocos.

Marconi Wireless Installations have been established at Cape Town and Durban (Port Natal). The former station has an effective daylight range of 400 and the latter 250 mile; these distances are considerably exceeded in night operations, which have been successfully carried out over more than 1,200 miles.

The rates of postage are:

| Letters ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|---------------|------------|
| Internal      | 1d.        |
| U. K. India & British Colonies | 1½d. per 4 oz. |
| Other Countries | 2½d. per 2 oz. |

Customs.

The four self-governing Colonies prior to the operation of the Act of Union gave notice to the Administrations of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia of their intention to retire from the South African Customs Union Convention in terms of Article xxiii. of that Convention, with effect from 30th June, 1910; and subsequently, on the consummation of the Union of South Africa, an agreement was concluded with these Administrations to continue all the essential features of the previous Customs Convention, viz.:

(a) The free interchange of the produce and manufactures of the Provinces of the Union, and the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, excepting spirits and beers, upon which duties not exceeding certain rates can be imposed;

(b) The collection by and payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of the duties imposed by the late Convention Tariff on goods intended for consumption in the said Territories, or vice versa, subject to a collecting charge of 5 per cent.; and

(c) The payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of 95 per cent. of the duty collected on imported materials which are contained to an appreciable extent in Union manufactures, and vice versa, entered for removal to the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Union of South Africa, as the case may be.

The Agreement continues in force until the 30th of June, 1911, and thereafter for periods of twelve months, subject to three months' notice by either party of its intention to retire therefrom as from the 30th June following such notice. If, however, either party amend the Customs Tariff, or take any steps in conflict with the spirit and intent of this Agreement, the other is at liberty to retire forthwith.

For like reasons, a Customs Agreement has been entered into between the Government of the Union and His Majesty's High Commissioner on behalf of the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland. The agreement is in all essentials identical to that referred to above, except that instead of a collecting charge of 5 per cent on all duties collected, and the payment of 95 per cent. of any duty collected on imported materials contained in Union manufactures, the basis laid down in Section No. 12 of the South Africa Act, 1909, for the adjustment of duties between the parties to the Agreement is followed, viz.: The Treasury of the Union will pay out quarterly a sum in respect of such duties which shall bear to the total Customs revenue of the Union in each year the same proportion as the average amount of the Customs revenue of such Territories for the three completed financial years last preceding the taking effect of the South Africa Act 1909.

The Transvaal Province continues, under the terms of the Transvaal-Mozambique Convention, to admit the products and manufactures of the Province of Mozambique, except spirits, free of duty, but such products and manufactures are liable to the Union import duty if removed to another Province in the Union or to Southern or North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland.

Pending legislation providing for the imposition of a uniform rate of Excise duty on spirits distilled in the several Provinces of the Union, a Customs duty, equivalent to any duty of excise in force in a Province is levied on the importation into that Province of spirits distilled in another Province of the Union. In the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, a surtax is
levied on the consumption of imported spirits. Excise is levied by means of stamps on cigarettes manufactured in the Union, or in the Bechuana-land Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland, when entered for consumption in the Union, of in these Territories, and an equivalent surtax is levied on imported cigarettes, whether from oversea or from Southern or North Western Rhodesia.

The principle of granting a rebate of Customs duties on all goods the growth or manufacture of the United Kingdom is maintained; likewise of granting such rebate of Customs duties to those British Colonies and Possessions which grant an equivalent rebate to the products and manufactures of the Union of South Africa.

All duties are rebated on goods in transit through any part of the Union to places outside the Union.

Imports and Exports.

The total Imports into the Union of South Africa in 1911 amounted to £38,035,495l., as against £38,940,694l. in 1910. Specie was, however, answerable for £2,165,430l. in 1910 and for only £1,097,698l. in 1911, a decrease of £1,067,732l. As regards articles of Commerce the figures should be £36,937,797l. in 1911 against £36,775,264l. the previous year showing an actual increase of £162,533l. These figures include the Importations by the South African Government, which for the last two years have been £1,979,937l. in 1911, and £2,720,189l. in 1910, a reduction which it is understood is partly accounted for by increased purchases through South African Merchants.

Manufacturing and Mining Machinery and also Electrical Machinery (closely allied to the other two) reached a very high importation in 1910, but showed a great decrease in 1911. The figures are as follows:

Industries.

The chief industries, apart from gold and diamond mining, are the production of wool, mohair, sugar, brandy, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco, fruit, lucerne, maize, tea, wattle bark, and the breeding of livestock and ostriches.

In addition to the above there has of late years been a satisfactory expansion of manufacturing enterprise in the matter of the ordinary necessaries of life as well as regards the requirements of the mining and building industries of the country.

As regards blasting compounds, the bulk of the requirements of the mining industry in this direction are now being met by the three Explosives Factories at Modderfontein (Transvaal) Somerset West (Cape Colony) and Kynochs (near Durban).

In the matter of building material, local manufacture has made great progress. Large works have been established chiefly at the Ports where the production of doors and window frames and other classes of joinery is increasing annually.

In this connection it might be stated that the question of Forestry is receiving a good deal of attention at the hands of the Department, which has been established for this purpose. The natural Forests of the Cape and Natal have been placed under responsible supervision and new tracts of suitable land are being planted with timber. A good deal of private enterprise in this matter is everywhere noticeable. An area of approximately 7,000 acres in the Cape Colony has been planted by the Railway Department for the purpose of growing timber suitable for railway sleepers.

The salt industry of the Union showed a production during 1911 of 40,498 tons, valued at £61,160l. on the producing site. Increasing attention is now being paid to the production of table and dairy salt, of which some 3,000 tons, valued at about £12,000l., were produced.

Amongst other promising industries of recent growth are the Pottery Works at Olifantsfontein, established chiefly through the instrumentality of Sir Thomas Cullinan, and the cement works near Pretoria. The potentialities of both undertakings are great and they constitute most promising contributions to the industrial activities of the Union.

An industry which is of recent but phenomenal growth is that of whale fishing around the South African Coast from Durban to Walfisch Bay. Several Companies are at present engaged in this work, Durban alone possessing a score steam vessels engaged in this enterprise. During 1911, whale-oil of the value of £96,163l., whalebone £2,145l., and whale-residue £19,034l. was exported from the Union.

The quantity of wine produced in the Cape Province during 1904—the Census year—amounted to 5,686,672 gallons; spirits, 1,534,069 gallons;
and vinegar 113,862 gallons; practically all consumed locally. In 1911 there were produced 1,047,320 gallons of wine brandy and 372,747 gallons of spirits other than wine brandy; an increase, taking the two classes together, of 102,046 proof gallons on the production of the previous year.

Ostrich farming is carried on largely in the Cape Province and to a less extent in Natal and the Transvaal. The annual value of the ostrich feather production of South Africa during 1910 was over £2 millions sterling, with a selling value of at least 6 millions sterling.

Well equipped agricultural colleges exist at Elsenberg in the Stellenbosch district; at Cedara, near Pietermaritzburg, and Potchefstroom in the Transvaal. The establishment of a central agricultural college within the municipal radius of Pretoria is at present under consideration.

The export of maize which has been made possible by low sea freight and reduced railway rates, has proved of much advantage to the farming community. The recorded value of the export of this cereal during 1911 was 402,680£., representing 103,277 tons. The grading of the grain is undertaken by the Government by means of special officers appointed for the purpose at each of the Union Ports.

The inspection of fruit intended for export is similarly supervised at place of shipment. The export of fruit for 1911 was valued at, fresh 45,572£., dried 4,164£.

In Natal and the Transvaal the coal trade has assumed very large proportions. The sales and values in the former case during 1911 was 2,679,551 tons, valued at 728,482£., and in the Transvaal 4,343,680 tons, valued at 1,020,539£. The figures for the Free State were 482,690 tons and for the Cape 89,023 tons. The amount of coal bunkered at the various ports was 1,426,586 tons.

The export of wattle bark during 1911 amounted to 55,602 tons, of a value of 289,556£.

The output of tea for the last recorded year was 2,100,000 lbs., and sugar 92,000 tons. The total quantity of wool exported during 1911 was 132,207,029 lbs., of a value of 3,899,828£.

Mining.

The Union of South Africa has a valuable asset in its extensive mineral deposits, and considerable mining activity prevails in all the four provinces. Foremost amongst the minerals produced are gold, diamonds, coal, copper and tin, whilst a variety of base minerals, such as asbestos, graphite, magnesite, zinc, lime, salt and others are being produced in a lesser degree.

Gold and diamond mining are by far the two most important industries, and the Union holds the premier position amongst the gold and diamond producing countries of the world.

The total value of the mineral output amounted to 47,679,294£. for the year 1911, the contribution by the various provinces being as follows:

| Province          | Value       |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Transvaal         | 38,892,509£.|
| Cape              | 6,152,654£. |
| Orange Free State | 1,829,159£. |
| Natal             | 805,072£.   |

In connection with this production the mineral industry expended during the year ended December, 1911, some 18,817,347£. on salaries and wages and 14,071,108£. on stores and machinery, and the labour employed by the industry in December, 1911, was 38,561 whites and 279,379 coloured, distributed as follows:

| Province          | Whites | Coloured |
|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Transvaal         | 32,245 | 227,852  |
| Cape              | 4,395  | 26,198   |
| Orange Free State | 1,341  | 13,652   |
| Natal             | 580    | 11,677   |

Gold.

Gold was discovered in the Transvaal and Natal Provinces about 1868 and in the Cape some years later. Operations in the Orange Free State have up to the present not gone beyond the prospecting stage and the production of the Cape and Natal is negligible, amounting only to 20,947£. for the former and 53,854£. for the latter out of a total production of approximately 325,102,222£. for the Union, from the commencement of operations till the end of 1911. Vigorous prospecting and development work continues in all the provinces. Practically all the gold produced comes therefore from the Transvaal and the foundation of its present huge industry, which in the year 1911 accounted for 36 per cent. of the world's production, may be said to date from 1884 when the Witwatersrand conglomerates were discovered.

The production of gold amounted in 1887 to a value of 169,401£., and rose steadily until 1898 when the Union's output reached a value of 16,241,134£. The South African War then interfered with operations and it was not till the end of 1903 that the industry began to assume its former proportions, the output for that year being 12,621,828£. Since then the yearly output has more than doubled itself amounting to 31,991,295£. and 35,049,041£. for the years 1910 and 1911 respectively, as compared to the world's output of approximately 97,250,000£. for the latter year. The contribution of the Witwatersrand mines to the output for 1910 and 1911 was 30,653,933£. and 33,599,689£. respectively.

The following are the values for the Transvaal for recent years:

| Year | Fine Ozs. | £       |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1903 | 2,971,418 | 12,621,781 |
| 1904 | 3,770,938 | 16,018,026 |
| 1905 | 4,908,098 | 20,848,273 |
| 1906 | 5,792,823 | 24,606,336 |
| 1907 | 6,450,740 | 27,400,992 |
| 1908 | 7,066,266 | 29,973,115 |
| 1909 | 7,295,108 | 30,987,650 |
| 1910 | 7,527,108 | 31,973,123 |
| 1911 | 8,249,461 | 35,041,485 |
| 1912 (estimated) | ... | 38,757,560 |

In 1897 the average number of persons employed in gold mining in the Union was 9,600 whites and 69,300 natives. These numbers rose to 12,000 and 107,000 just before the war in 1899, and amounted to about 10,000 and 45,000 in December, 1902.

The following gives the labour force engaged in the gold mining industry in the various provinces during the months of December, 1911, and June, 1912:

| Province          | December, 1911 | June, 1912 |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|
|                   | Whites | Coloured | Whites | Coloured |
| Transvaal         | 25,264 | 195,767 | 25,129 | 210,362 |
| Cape              | 2      | 10      | 9      | 20      |
| Orange Free State | 7      | 31      | 5      | 10      |
| Natal             | 22     | 264     | 22     | 212     |
|                   | 25,295 | 196,072 | 25,165 | 210,604 |
The average daily wages paid in Dec., 1911, to skilled whites on the Witwatersrand Gold Mines were from 9s. 7½d. to 35s. 4½d., according to trade or occupation (contractors on shaft sinking earning over 50s. per shift).

The monthly wages for natives averaged 52s. 1½d. on Transvaal Gold Mines, on Cape Diamond Mines 91s. 11½d., on Orange Free State Diamond Mines 64s. 6½d., and on Natal Coal Mines 45s. 2½d. Housing and food are supplied to natives at the expense of companies except in the Cape where housing only is provided.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West in the Cape Province, in the Pretoria, Zoutpansberg and Kliprivier districts of the Transvaal, and in the Fauresmith, Boshof and Kroonstad districts of the Orange Free State.

The first diamond was found by accident in 1867 in the Hopetown district, annexed to the Cape since 1876, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected.

In the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of the Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring provinces. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871 the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley.

Following soon on these discoveries, diamond mines were also located in the Fauresmith district of the Orange Free State.

Apart from spasmodic diggings on the banks of the Vaal River and the operations of the various small companies and syndicates, the Transvaal did not enter the field as a producer of importance till after the year 1902, when the Premier diamond mine was discovered.

The stones obtained in the mines of the Transvaal are of inferior quality to Cape and Orange Free State stones. For example, at one period when Transvaal diamonds were selling at about 13s. per carat those from the other two provinces were averaging 42s. and 36s. respectively.

The largest diamond in the world, well known as the "Cullinan" diamond, was found in the Premier Mine (Transvaal). Its weight was 3,025 carats, or nearly 1½ lbs.

According to available records, the value of the diamond output to December, 1911, was £149,749,558, but statistical records for the earlier years are incomplete, and exportations of diamonds to date may safely be placed at over £159,000,000 in value.

The production by the different provinces is as follows for the past four years:

| Year | Carats | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1908 | 2,022,688 | £1,549,815 |
| 1909 | 1,877,486 | 1,176,680 |
| 1910 | 2,090,068 | 1,416,464 |
| 1911 | 1,843,341 | 1,628,876 |

The labour employed by diamond mines in December, 1911, and June, 1912, was as hereunder:

| Month | Whites | Coloured | Whites | Coloured |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| Dec. 1911 | 819 | 9,901 | 878 | 15,475 |
| June 1912 | 2,713 | 13,793 | 2,647 | 15,603 |
| O.F.S. | 1,050 | 11,231 | 1,092 | 10,364 |

TOTAL ... 4,582 34,925 4,617 41,442

These figures do not include individual diggers, of which there are several thousand.

Coal.

Large deposits of coal of various qualities are found in all four provinces. The Natal and Transvaal fields produce the better qualities and are also the most favourably situated with respect to the various markets.

Natal coal is mostly bunkered by steamers calling at Durban, or exported overseas to South America and Asia and to South African ports. The gold and diamond mines and other local industries, as well as the railways, constitute the markets for the coal produced in the other provinces.

The pit's mouth value of coal produced in the Union up to the end of 1911 was, for the £

| Province | Tons | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| Transvaal | 4,343,680 | 1,020,539 |
| Cape | 89,023 | 51,660 |
| Orange Free State | 482,690 | 137,616 |
| Natal | 2,679,551 | 726,448 |

TOTAL ... 23,526,231

The output of coal for the year 1911 was:

| Province | Tons of 2000 lbs. | Value |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Transvaal | 4,343,680 | 1,020,539 |
| Cape | 89,023 | 51,660 |
| Orange Free State | 482,690 | 137,616 |
| Natal | 2,679,551 | 726,448 |

The average value per ton at pit's mouth was in December, 1911:

| Province | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Transvaal | 4 6½ |
| Cape | 11 0½ |
| Orange Free State | 5 6½ |
| Natal | 5 6½ |

The keen competition in the Transvaal, Orange Free State and Natal largely accounts for the lower prices obtained in those provinces as compared with the Cape price.
The number of persons employed in coal mines was, in December, 1911, and June, 1912, as follows:

|                | December, 1911 | June, 1912 |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Whites. Coloured. Whites. Coloured. |               |            |
| Transvaal      | 490           | 9,067      |
| Cape           | 86            | 1,108      |
| O.F.S.         | 116           | 1,722      |
| Natal          | 525           | 10,483     |
| **Total**      | **1,217**     | **22,400** |

Other Minerals.

Copper and tin are the only base minerals other than coal which so far have been exploited to any appreciable extent, and only the Transvaal and Cape Provinces contribute to the output of these minerals. Copper mining has been carried on in the Cape since 1852 in the neighbourhood of Port Nolloth, on the Western sea border, and some 8,500,000l. worth of this metal has been exported to date from this province. It was not till the year 1906 that success attended prospecting operations in the Transvaal for tin and copper and enabled this province to enter the list of producers. Operations quickly expanded and up to the end of 1911 tin and copper ore have been exported to the value of 1,123,262l. and 273,750l. respectively.

The Transvaal tin fields are situated in the Rustenburg and Waterberg districts to the west of the Pretoria-Pietersburg railway, whilst the copper propositions are located along the northern boundary close to the Limpopo river.

Tin and copper ores were exported during the year 1911 to the value of:

|                | Tin | Copper |
|----------------|-----|--------|
| Transvaal      | 410,848 | 48,237 |
| Cape           | 1,023 | 503,908 |
| **Total**      | **411,871** | **552,145** |

The value of other base minerals produced in the Union during 1911 was 246,073l.

Labour employed on these base metal industries was in—

|                | December, 1911 | June, 1912 |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Whites. Colred. Whites. Colred. |               |            |
| Transvaal      | 405           | 4,056      |
| Cape           | 194           | 2,072      |
| Orange Free State | 3       | 71        |
| Natal          | 5             | 48         |
| **Total**      | **607**       | **6,247**  |

Miscellaneous articles produced (such as cement, machine-made bricks and pottery) amounted to 639,780l., and silver contained in the gold bullion and base metal ores exported was valued at 98,507l.

LAND ADMINISTRATION.

Union of South Africa.

During the session of 1912 the Union parliament passed a Land Settlement Act (No. 12 of 1912), which provides inter alia, for the purchase by government of private farms for persons able to pay not less than one-fifth of the purchase price of such farms in cash, the remainder of the purchase price plus interest calculated from the date of purchase at the rate of four per cent. per annum, being repayable in forty equal instalments. The Act also provides for the disposal of Crown land, and any land the government may under this Act acquire from private persons, on lease for five years with option of purchase to approved applicants. One important condition of the allotment is that of continuous personal occupation of the land by the lessees. Advances may be made to lessees for the purchase of stock, implements, seeds and other things necessary for the development and working of the holding, but such advances must not exceed 50 per cent. of the total capital expended by a lessee on the improvement of his holding.

The Act lays down the qualifications of intending lessees, and prescribes that they must possess capital sufficient for beneficially developing and working the holding applied for.

Not less than ten years after the date of commencement of a lease, a lessee is entitled to a Crown grant of his own holding, provided the purchase price instalments have been paid and the provisions of the Act have been complied with.

In the Cape Province the area of vacant Crown land is about 10,690,611 morgen; in Natal and Zululand 403,825 acres surveyed, and 1,688,580 unsurveyed; in the Transvaal, 10,196,306 morgen; in the Orange Free State, 52,880 morgen. For the present it will be necessary to work under certain of the provincial laws.

Geological Survey.

The geological survey of the Transvaal, together with what was formerly the Cape geological commission, have now been incorporated together as the geological survey of the Union of South Africa, under the direction of H. Kynaston, B.A., director, with A. W. Rogers, B.A., as assistant director.

The field staff are now engaged in the Transvaal, Cape and Natal Provinces, and a special survey of the Witwaterstrand Goldfields is also being undertaken.

The publications consist of annual reports, memoirs and maps.

Forests.

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Union of South Africa is approximately 873,017 morgen (1,843,036 acres). The attention of the government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown forests. The Union is divided into seven conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests, stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna, Umtata, Pretoria, Maritzburg and Bloemfontein respectively, who is directly responsible to the chief conservator of forests for the Union at Pretoria. The present annual importation of timber into the Union is about 12,000,000 cubic feet, mostly pine, derived from Europe and America, the balance being hardwood from Australia. There is at present a large importation of hardwood sleepers. Expenditure on forests for year 1911, 112,815l.; cash revenue 51,127l.; value of gratis issues from forest estate, 39,402l.; total revenue 90,874l. Timber removals from forest estate during 1911, aggregated 1,407,726 cubic feet.

Land Board.

The land board, created in 1901, has been engaged in facilitating the settlement of British farmers. This board was replaced on October 1st, 1907, by the new land board provided for in the letters patent, who held office and administered the affairs of land settlement for five years from above date. Since October 1st, 1901,
up to 1905, when the board made no further purchases, 1,109,081 acres had been purchased at a cost of £46,184l. In addition to this, 519,632 acres were inherited from the late Orange Free State government, value at £32,000l., so that government had at its disposal 1,628,713 acres, valued at £1,166,184l. The whole of this was distributed among 647 settlers, or an average of a little under 2,270 acres each. The board created in 1907 ceased to exist, in terms of the constitution providing for the establishment of responsible government in the late Orange River colony, on the 30th September, 1912, on which date there were 550 settlers, heads of families, under its control and well established upon the land, exclusive of 97 men who had completed purchase, thus becoming freehold owners. During the existence of the two boards, over 1,200 settlers were placed upon the land, the majority of whom are still farming in the province. In order to meet the wishes of the settlers who were sufficiently established to work out their own salvation without further assistance, the Union government brought forward a new Act which, after receiving the approval of parliament during the last session, came into force on the 1st July, 1912. Under this Act (No. 15 of 1912) facilities are given settlers in the Orange Free State to obtain Crown grants of land on perpetual quit rent tenure, and practically every settler applied to the board to come under this Act, thereby making it unnecessary for the government to arrange for the continuation of any administrative body in respect of these settlers, after the demise of the board on the 30th September, 1912, in accordance with the provisions of the letters patent. The Act in question has made a very satisfactory and fitting ending to Lord Milner's O.R.C. land settlement scheme, commenced on the 1st October, 1901, and ended on the 30th September, 1912. The capital sum of £1,250,000 received from inter-colonial funds has been expended on the experiment, and the board handed over to the Union government, in addition to some £90,000l. in cash, assets in land and other securities amounting in value to a sum equal to, if not greater than, the capital sum above mentioned, which will be recoverable during the next twenty years or so, with meanwhile an assured income, in interest at four per cent., of £50,000l. per annum. As practically every settler who has been established on the land is a progressive settler and an asset to the country, the first government-aided land settlement scheme of this scope and nature introduced into South Africa can be safely written down a success.

Education.

In the South Africa Act, sec. 85 (iii.), it is provided that "Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years and thereafter until parliament otherwise provides," shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the respective provincial councils.

For practical purposes it has been provisionally determined that all post-matriculation instruction shall be deemed to constitute higher education.

The department of education, under the minister, is therefore concerned with:—

(1) (a) The University of the Cape of Good Hope, Capetown, established by Act No. 16 of 1873. It is empowered to grant degrees, but with no attached teaching institutions. Registrar, W. Thomson, M.A., B.Sc., LL.D.

(b) The South African College, Capetown, founded in 1829, its affairs being established and regulated by Ordinance No. 11 of 1837, and Acts No. 19 of 1858, and No. 30 of 1861. These enactments were repealed by Act No. 15 of 1878, which makes provision for the future regulation of the institution. Registrar, A. D. R. Tugwell.

(c) Victoria College, Stellenbosch, incorporated by Act No. 9 of 1881. Acting Registrar, A. F. Markotter, B.A.

(d) Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, incorporated by Act No. 21 of 1904. Registrar, H. Greener.

(e) Huguenot College, Wellington, incorporated by Act No. 27 of 1907. Principal, Dr. A. E. Bliss, M.A.

(f) Grey University College, Bloemfontein, incorporated by Act No. 5 of 1910. Registrar, E. N. Grayson, M.A.

(g) Transvaal University College, Pretoria, incorporated by Act No. 1 of 1910. Secretary, D. G. Hafner.

(h) South Africa School of Mines and Technology, Johannesburg, incorporated by Act No. 4 of 1910. Principal, G. H. Thompson, B.Sc.

(i) Natal University College, Pietermaritzburg, incorporated by Act No. 18 of 1909. Registrar, David Robb.

Native Affairs.

Cape: The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amakosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs and others living along the Orange river, took up arms against the colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate with a body of police was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up and the special commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now part of the Cape Province.

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve and Noman's Land were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffiths, C.M.G., then commandant of the frontier armed and mounted police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-6 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of
incorporation Gcalekal and, and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the chief of the Bomvanas. Palir, chief of the Ametshezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pandomisi tribe, under the chiefs Umditshwa and Umhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The port at the St. John's River mouth was annexed to the Colony in 1884, and Customs dues are now levied there under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881.

By Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umojikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umojikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umojikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Nqwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Ngwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xeisebe country after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now within the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and are grouped under one Chief Native Commissioner, who is stationed at Umtata, while there are 29 subordinate magistrates. Griqualand East with a population (according to the census of 1911) of 7,944 Europeans, 236,574 Bantu, 4,520 mixed, has nine magistrates; Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, with a population of 8,148 Europeans, 226,087 Bantu, 1,821 mixed, has seven magistrates; Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, with population of 2,188 Europeans, 186,318 Bantu, 209 mixed, has six magistrates; Pondoland, comprising East and West Pondoland and Port St. John's, with a population of 1,386 Europeans, 231,682 Bantu, 1,249 mixed, has seven magistrates.

Natal and Zululand.—In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "Native Law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch law and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters; a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime, Mala in se. This system of Government remains in operation at the present time, under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11 of 1865; but at the same time and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may, in certain cases, apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently, by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A Law, No. 26 of 1875, established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work so well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875, the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of £1 per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903, to £2 per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust for occupation by natives is about 2,400,000 acres,
the land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

**Defence.**

The Defence Forces at present consist partly of the garrison of regular troops maintained in the country and paid for out of the Imperial Exchequer, and partly of local forces.

The following is the garrison establishment:

- 4 Cavalry Regiments ... 2,368 of all ranks.
- 2 Horse Artillery Batteries
- 6 Field Artillery Batteries
- 2 Companies of Garrison Artillery ... 1,572
- 5 Engineer Companies ... 599
- 6 Battalions of Infantry including 2 Battalions of Mounted Infantry of 3 Companies each ... 5,812
- Army Service Corps ... 397
- Royal Army Medical Corps ... 357
- Army Ordnance Corps ... 260
- Army Veterinary Corps ... 78
- Army Pay Corps ... 42

Total ... 11,485

These troops are distributed in various stations in the Transvaal, Orange Free State, Natal and Cape of Good Hope Provinces. Headquarters is at Pretoria.

The South African Defence Act, 1912, became law on the 14th of June, 1912.

This Act provides for the establishment of Defence Forces, comprising:

1. a Permanent Force,
2. a Coast Garrison Force,
3. a Citizen Force,
4. a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, and
5. Special Reserves.

Every citizen between the ages of 17 and 60 is liable to render personal service in time of war and those between 21 and 25 are liable to undergo a prescribed peace training with the Active Citizen Force spread over a period of four consecutive years. The Act states, however, that only 50 per cent. of the total number liable to peace training shall actually undergo that training unless Parliament makes financial provision for the training of a greater number.

The establishment of Rifle Associations is a marked feature of the Act; Citizens between the ages of 21 and 25 who are not entered for peace training with the Active Citizen Force are to be compelled to undergo training during these four years in a Rifle Association, thus ensuring that, in course of time, all citizens will at least know how to handle and use a rifle.

Provision is also made in the Act for the cadet training of boys between 13 and 17 in urban and other populous areas where facilities can conveniently be arranged.

Existing Militia and Volunteer units established under the late Colonial Governments are to be embodied in the Active Citizen Force.

The Defence Vote for 1912-13 amounted to £540,699. This sum provides a small permanent force of about 600 Cape Mounted Riflemen, who are nearly all employed on Police duty under present conditions; volunteer forces of about 4,000 in the Cape Province and a similar number in the Transvaal; a militia force of about 3,000 in Natal, and about 12,000 cadets distributed throughout the Union.

Other charges include contribution to His Majesty's Navy, Fixed Defences, inception of New Defence Organisations, etc.

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PROVINCE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Province of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 29° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange Free State and Natal Provinces. The Cape Province, with the Transkei, contains an area of 276,995 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 26 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walvisch Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tamboekieland, Bomvanaland, and Goalekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1886, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesiibe country ("Mount Ayliff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed. Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the Haarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1746, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force therupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir
war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were: (1.) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. (2.) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. (3.) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in recent years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1911, the final audited figures for which are not available yet, the total population of the Province was found to be 2,564,965, comprising 1,255,671 males, and 1,309,294 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 582,377; Natives, 1,519,939; other coloured races, 462,649.

The proportion of females is now 104 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 9.26. The number of inhabited dwellings was 528,612, of which 1,076 were not intended for dwelling-houses, though used as such.

The population of Bechuana land, as ascertained at the census of 1911, was: Europeans, 14,917; Bantu, 71,877; mixed and other coloured, 12,759.

The population of the Transkeian Territories at the Census of 1911 was: Europeans, 19,660; Bantu, 879,126; mixed and other coloured, 9,920.

In the Colony proper the European birth rate in 1904 was computed to be 31.81 per 1,000, the
Coloured rate at 30·77. The death rate amongst Europeans was 12·61 per 1,000, and the Coloured rate 26·42, during the same year.

**Constitution.**

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope became one of the four Provinces of the Union of South Africa. The Province is subject to the Parliament of the Union, but the control of certain matters of a provincial character is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Cape Town is the seat of Provincial Government.

For the purpose of the House of Assembly elections for the Parliament of the Union, the Province of the Cape of Good Hope is divided into 51 electoral divisions each returning one member. Members are elected by voters who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act, No. 9 of 1892, Cape) by possession of property worth 75l., or receipt of salary or wages of not less than 50l. per annum, but no one can be duly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation, and is a British subject by birth or naturalization. The number of registered electors in 1911 in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope was 148,551. The Registration Act, No. 14 of 1887, makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy, and further provision in the direction of improved machinery is made in the Parliamentary Representation Act, No. 19 of 1898, the Registration of Parliamentary Voters Amendment Act, No. 48 of 1899, the Parliamentary Indemnity Act, No. 5 of 1902, and in the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 6 of 1908.

Elections are conducted under the Ballot Act, No. 9 of 1892, as amended by Acts No. 48 of 1899 and No. 6 of 1908.

The Provincial Council of the Province consists of the same number of members (51) as are elected in the Province for the House of Assembly, and they are elected by the persons qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Assembly in the Province voting in the same electoral divisions. The procedure relating to the conduct of elections is similar to that of the House of Assembly.

**Local Government.**

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and Crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of six to eight elective members, exclusive of the Civil Commissioner, who is usually also Resident Magistrate, as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns eighteen members, and where under Act 33 of 1909, the body is called "The Rural Council." The electors are the owners or occupiers of immovable property, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than 500l. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they also have important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They were 81 in number in 1911, and their receipts for the year ended 13th June, 1911, amounted to £260,235l. (exclusive of Cape Division). Payments for the same period amounted to £248,609l. (exclusive of Cape Division). The receipts of the Rural Council, Cape, for the year ended 31st December, 1911, amounted to £33,568l., and the payments to £31,143l. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Provincial Auditor.

Municipalities were first established by an Ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards, which Act has from time to time been supplemented by additional legislation on the subject. In 1912, however, the Act of 1882 and all these subsequent enactments were repealed and replaced by a consolidating Ordinance, which added considerably to the powers of Municipal Councils, more especially in respect of the combination and co-operation of municipalities, the abatement of nuisances, and the framing of regulations. The Ordinance also provided for pensions and allowances to retiring Municipal Officials. While thus greatly increasing the powers of municipalities, the Ordinance at the same time strengthened somewhat the central control exercised by the Provincial Administration. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24 (except in the case of municipalities having a population of over 100,000, where the number may be not exceeding 36), one-third of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. Certain municipalities are under special Acts, but all Town Councils or municipalities under the Ordinance of 1912 have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property; no rate may, however, exceed 4d. in the £ on the value, except with the concurrence of the registered voters of the municipality.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There are 123 municipalities in the Province, the receipts from all sources during
the year 1909 amounted to £1,164,712l. The amount of loans outstanding, 31st December, 1909 (excluding bank overdrafts), was £6,478,874l., and the assessed rateable value of fixed property was £54,866,101l. Payments during the same period amounted to £1,228,263l. The Provincial Auditor has no general control over municipal accounts, but one of the two Municipal Auditors is appointed annually by the Administrator of the Province.

Village management boards, of which there are 85 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are three or five members elected annually by the voters registered for parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1908-9 to £12,763l. 2s., excluding balances.

**Fisheries.**

This subject has been engaging the attention of the Cape Provincial Government since the inception of Union.

Under the Fisheries Ordinance which was passed in 1911, regulations were promulgated providing for the better protection of both sea and fresh-water fish. Fishing boats employed for purposes of profit are now licensed and registered, and a licence is also necessary before trout can be caught in any of the public waters of the Cape Province.

The license fee to catch Trout is 10s. during the open season, which is, in the case of the Western Area, including all Divisions situate West of the Eastern boundaries of the Divisions of Knysna, George, Oudtshoorn, Prince Albert, Beaufort West, Victoria West, Britstown and Hope Town; (1) in the case of rivers, between the 1st day of October in any year and the 15th day of January in the following year, both days inclusive, and (2) in the case of vlei, between the 15th day of September in any year and the 31st day of March in the following year, both days inclusive; and in the Eastern Area including the Transkeian Territories and all Divisions situate East of the boundary of the Western portion of the Province as defined above, between the 1st day of October in any year to the 30th day of April in the following year, both days inclusive.

Scientific investigations into the habits and spawning seasons of various kinds of fish are also carried on at the Aquarium at St. James, under the direction of Dr. Gilchrist, Fishery Adviser to the Cape Provincial Government.

PROVINCE OF NATAL.

Situation and Area.

Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from Cape Town, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange Free State and Basutoland, and on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,371 square miles, and has a seaboard of 376 miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. Pietermaritzburg is the seat of the Provincial Government, and has a population of 29,980, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 59,000 inhabitants, of whom 14,700 are natives, 13,900 Indians and other Asiatics, and 28,450 whites, the remainder being of mixed descent. (These numbers are now approximate only.)

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonise it. Tshaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingana, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Tshaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Boers obtained a decisive victory, and placed Mpande, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingana, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the South African Republic (as the Transvaal was at that time called) and Orange Free State on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other, Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and a Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotahe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,764 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,970 square miles.

Zululand and Tongaland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Tshaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Tshaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingana in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Mpande. In the latter years of Mpande Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Mpande's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetshwayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetshwayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetshwayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetshwayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating
from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetshwayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetshwayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyanezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginholu on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetshwayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetshwayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Tshaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetshwayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatuze River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatuze and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetshwayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Ustuts (the name by which the personal adherents of Cetshwayo—as distinct from the Zulus in general—were known), finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetshwayo, as King; but it was soon checked, with the assistance of the Imperial troops, and Dinuzulu with his uncles Ndabuko and Tshingana were arrested, tried and convicted of high treason, and removed to St. Helena, while other offenders were tried on other charges, and imprisoned or fined. Dinuzulu and his two uncles were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1898.

In 1890 Tongaland and the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1896 the territories of the Chiefs Mbikiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Tongaland, also called Maputaland,
which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongolo with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Tongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the Colonial forces, with assistance from detachments of volunteers from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

In 1907 there was a further recrudescence of unrest amongst the natives in Zululand, which was, however, easily suppressed without actual bloodshed. Dinuzulu, son of Cetshwayo, together with other chiefs and ringleaders, was arrested, and tried on charges of high treason, rebellion, sedition, murder, etc., and found guilty, though complicity in the murders of several noted loyalist Chiefs was not proved as against Dinuzulu. Dinuzulu was sentenced to four years' imprisonment, whilst other Chiefs were sentenced for longer periods and transported to St. Helena. It was generally believed that prompt action was the means of arresting what might have been a very serious conflagration.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were issued making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or rents property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony for three years, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to vote.

The act constituting the Union of South Africa was passed by the Imperial Parliament on the 20th September, 1909, and Natal became a Province of the Union on the 31st May, 1910.

**Population.**

At the census of 1904, the Europeans numbered 97,109, or 8·8 per cent., of whom about 12,500 were Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 4,500 colonists of German descent, of whom the greater portion are settled in the New Hanover and Lower Umzimkulu divisions.

As estimated at 31st December, 1909:—

| Europeans or Whites | 92,643 |
|---------------------|--------|
| Mixed and others    | 7,080  |
| Indians and Asiatics| 118,714|
| All natives         | 1,030,597|

Total . . . . 1,249,034

49·15 per cent. of the present white population were born in the Colony. The figures at the 1911 census are:—

| Europeans or Whites | 98,114 |
|---------------------|--------|
| Natives             | 953,398|
| Other coloured races| 142,531|

Total . . . . 1,194,043

**Local Government.**

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, Dundee, and Vryheid, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht, Estcourt, Charlestown, Weenen, Harding, Paarlpietersburg, and South Barrow. Their total revenue in 1911 was 847,943l., their expenditure 781,537l., and their debt 3,992,371l.

**Education.**

In the year ended 31st December, 1911, there were 562 schools under Government inspection—303 European, 25 coloured, 198 native, and 36 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 36,221. There are 66 Government schools, and 496 Government-aided schools. Since the establishment of Union, education other than higher education, which is controlled by the Union Government, comes under the control of the Provincial Administration, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the year ending 31st December, 1911, amounted to 150,471l. 8s. 3d., and the revenue to 20,957l. 13s. 7d.

PROVINCE OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Province of the Orange Free State lies to the north of the Orange River and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and the Province of Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts.

The population, according to the census, which was taken in 1904, was 387,315, of whom 142,679 were white. The Census of 1911 shows the population as 528,174, of whom 175,189 are Europeans or whites.

Bloemfontein is the seat of the Provincial Government.

History.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Mosheh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the rush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the
Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the establishment of Responsible Government, July, 1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown Colony Government was established, and continued till 30th June, 1907, when Responsible Government was granted. The election of the first Legislative Assembly took place in November, 1907.

The Legislature consisted of two Chambers—a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly, consisting of 11 and 39 members respectively.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Orange River Colony became, under the name of the Orange Free State, a Province of the Union of South Africa, and is now governed in terms of the South Africa Act which constituted the Union of South Africa. Apart from the general control of the Union Parliament the Act provided that the control of certain specified matters should be vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Education.

Education, except higher education, as defined by the South Africa Act, 1909, is under the control of the Administrator of the Province for the Provincial Council, and is administered by a Director. From 1900 to 1905 the schools were managed, teachers were selected and appointed, and all expenditure was borne by the Government. Local Education Committees were established in the towns in 1903, but these were merely advisory bodies. In terms of an agreement come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church in March, 1905, the Christian National Schools, which had been started a year previously, were amalgamated with the Government Schools.

In 1908 a new School Act was passed and came into force on the 1st November. The principal changes introduced by this Act are as follows:

Fees are payable in respect of pupils at all primary and secondary public schools and aided private schools, provision being made for exemption in necessitous cases. English and Dutch are put on an equal footing as media of instruction in the various subjects of the curriculum, certain modifications being permitted according to circumstances during the first three years after the taking effect of the Act. With the exception of certain high schools, every primary and secondary public school is placed under the supervision of a committee consisting of five or seven members (according to the size and importance of the school) elected by the parents of children attending such school. The central local control in each district is vested in the District Board, which consists of nine members, the bare majority of whom are elected by the committees within the district, and the rest appointed by the Minister in charge of Education. Religious instruction can only be given by members of the school staff, and dogmatic teaching is prohibited during school hours, except in country schools when parents request that such instruction be given.

In 1912 an Ordinance to amend the School Act on the question of medium was passed by the Provincial Council. The main feature of this Ordinance is that it introduces mother-tongue instruction up to Standard IV. For classes above that Standard parents are allowed to choose the medium of instruction.

On the termination of hostilities in 1902 the total number of pupils attending permanent schools in the Orange River Colony was 1,933. Many children were then receiving instruction in the refugee camp schools. In June, 1903, when all the refugee camps had been broken up, the numbers in attendance at town and country schools in the Colony were 9,031. In 1910 the roll was 19,131, and in 1912 it was 21,600.

A normal college in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination held annually in April, while teachers in technical subjects are trained in the Polytechnic College, Bloemfontein.

There is also an industrial school in Bloemfontein where orphans and sons of poor parents are maintained and supervised at Government expense, and apprenticed to various trades and industries in the town.

Courses of instruction are also given in agriculture at Grey College, in household economy at Eunice High School, and in cookery, dressmaking, art needlework and millinery in Bloemfontein and at various other centres in the Colony.

Spinning and weaving schools have also been started in several places throughout the Province, and have met with a considerable measure of success.

The above statement refers to the education and training of white people only. A small grant is also given annually in aid of the education of natives. This grant is paid to the various religious denominations which undertake the work of native education, and the amount is in proportion to the number of children in the schools. There are about 10,000 native children in these schools.

The expenditure on education (excluding higher education, for which see Union) in 1911–12 was approximately 194,000L.

TRANSVAAL PROVINCE.

Situation and Area.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange Free State Province and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and by the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal Province at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22° S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude.

Its area is 110,426 square miles, with a population, according to the census of 17th April, 1904, of 1,269,951, of whom 297,277 are whites, 937,127 aboriginal natives, and 35,547 other coloured races. The estimated population in 1910 was 1,400,000, of whom 350,000 were Europeans. The population according to the Census of 1911, is:—1,686,212, of whom 420,562 are Europeans, 1,219,845 are Natives, and 45,805 belong to other coloured races. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea.

History.

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British Government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1858, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000l. in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000l. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetshwayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuanas chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; guerilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of its people. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided refusal.

In December, 1880, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were imme-
diately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender.

The town, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Pietermaritzburg in Natal to relieve them. A large force of Boers opposed his entry into the Transvaal at Laing's Nek, the path across the Drakensberg mountains.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr. Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice, with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs; that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuana land tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs, the Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—“The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engage-
ment with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to £77,877l., had risen in 1890 to £229,061l., reaching £329,968l. in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifte by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1896, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his intermeditation Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1896, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a
franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volkraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuta, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years' offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years' franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

Aftersome correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw in its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslaagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnoissance from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chievely after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.
The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronjé was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.

The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by..."
the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (36, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1906, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieut.-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

On 6th December, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The legislature consisted of two chambers, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the former containing fifteen members and the latter sixty-nine.

The Transvaal was included as an original Province of the Union of South Africa in terms of the South Africa Act, 1909, which came into operation on the 31st May, 1910, and is now governed under that Act. Apart from the general control of the Parliament of the Union, the control of certain matters specified in the South Africa Act is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Municipal Government.

Municipal Government was established in the principal towns of the Province by Ordinances enacted in 1903. These Ordinances were extended and amended during the years 1904-1909 inclusive, and were during the 1912 of the Provincial Council consolidated and further amended so as to give local authorities more extensive powers, principally in regard to matters effecting the public health, although other important amendments, e.g., the basis of the municipal franchise, and the principle of councillors contracting with Councils, were incorporated in the consolidating and amending Ordinances. Three Ordinances were enacted dealing with:

(a) the constitution of Local Authorities, i.e., Town and Village Councils and Health Committees, and the powers and duties of such bodies;
(b) the election of councillors, and
(c) the levying of assessment rates,
and now await the assent of His Excellency the Governor-General-in-Council. Under these Ordinances, as under previous legislation, the Provincial Administration retains some measure of control over the government of Municipalities, limited, however, to powers of audit and surcharge, the approval of loan proposals, local improvement schemes and the alienation of Municipal property. There are now 37 Municipalities in the Province and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made since the inauguration of local self-government.

In areas under the jurisdiction of Town Councils the Municipal franchise under the new Ordinance is extended to all white persons, being British subjects, of over the age of 21 years who:

(1) own rateable property of the assessed value of 100l.; or
(2) occupy rateable property within the Municipality of the assessed value of 300l. and who have resided within the Municipality for a period of six months; or
(3) who have resided in the Municipality for a period of 12 months;

and Councillors will be required to hold the following alternative qualifications:

(a) ownership of fixed property to the value of 250l.; or
(b) occupation of property within the Municipality to the value of 500l. and residence within the Municipality for a period of twelve months.

In areas under the jurisdiction of village Councils the qualification of voters and Councillors is occupation of and residence in premises within the Municipality of the gross annual value of 6l. and upwards or ownership of immovable property in the Municipality in respect of which assessment rates or erf taxes are payable.

Aliens or coloured British subjects are not eligible to vote, to sit on Town or Village Councils, or to become members of Health Committees. Women are not eligible as Town or Village Councillors though competent to vote at elections of such bodies.

The election of councillors of the various Municipalities is by ballot, and in all the larger towns the procedure followed is based on the lines prescribed for Municipal elections by the English Acts of Parliament. In the Municipalities of Pretoria and Johannesburg and Roodepoort-Maraisburg the principle of proportional representation was applied to the election of councillors by Act No. 23 of 1908, the system used being commonly known as that of the "single transferable vote." This Act is, however, repealed by the new Elections Ordinance and, if the latter is assented to, the old system of election will be reverted to in those Municipalities.
Legislation enacted in 1905 and 1906 provided for the creation of Health Committees where the density of population made it necessary in semi-urban areas for sanitary measures to be enforced. Eleven of these committees have been established. Provision is now made in the Local Government Ordinance of 1912 for the constitution of such bodies and wider powers of control are delegated to them under that Ordinance.

HIGH COMMISSION.

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa was created by Letters Patent in 1878. In 1879 a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who was also Governor of Natal (which now includes Zululand and Amatongaland). The High Commissioner for South Africa, who, under the Commission of 1889, was the officer for the time being administering the Government of the Cape, represents the Crown in all matters occurring in South Africa beyond the limits of the Colonies properly so called. He was, till 1899, charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native states and tribes outside the Colonies of the Cape and Natal, including Swaziland, which was administered by the Government of the South African Republic under the Convention of 1894.

The High Commissioner is Governor of Basutoland, supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland, and exercises...
the control provided by Order in Council over the Administration of the British South Africa Company in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898, and the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1911, provide respectively for a control by the High Commissioner over legislation, important appointments, and Native affairs in Southern and Northern Rhodesia, and for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, who is paid from Imperial funds and acts as the local representative of the High Commissioner and the Imperial Government. The office of High Commissioner, which was formerly held by the Governor of Cape Colony, was, by a Commission dated Oct. 6th, 1900, vested in Lord Milner, by a similar Commission, dated March 15th, 1905, in Lord Selborne, and by a similar Commission, dated March 30th, 1910, in Lord Gladstone, who is also Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.

**BASUTOLAND.**

**Situation and Area.**

Basutoland forms an irregular oval in the north-east of the Cape Colony; the main axis, about 150 miles in length, lying in a north-easterly direction. The Orange Free State Province, Natal and the Cape Province form its boundaries. Its area is 11,716 square miles, or nearly as large as Belgium.

It lies between 29 and 30 degrees south lat., and between 27 and 28 degrees east long.

**Description and Climate.**

The territory, which is well watered, and enjoys an excellent climate, is the finest grain-producing country in South Africa, and the abundant grass enables the Basutos to rear immense herds of cattle. The scenery is grand, and in many parts extremely beautiful.

The Maluti Mountains, forming a part of the great Drakensberg chain, occupy most of the country, which is really one continuous elevated plateau, though broken and rugged. The extension of arable culture has tended to drive the cattle more and more into the high ground. The range of temperature during the year 1906-1907 was from a maximum of 93° F. to a minimum of 11° F., while the mean temperature for the year was 58°76° F. The rainfall for 1906-7 was 41°49 inches.

The climate is perfect for Europeans and natives alike, and when more easily reached the country will prove a great health resort. Its high altitude and pure atmosphere prove most invigorating. *Phthisis pulmonalis* is almost unknown except among the section of natives who have taken to wearing clothes, and Europeans who have come to the country on account of their disease. The latter in early stages of the disease improve at once. Persons suffering from malarial fever or its results are benefited greatly by a short residence in Basutoland. Leprosy imported from the Orange River Colony and Cape Colony has now a firm hold in the country, the proportion being about 91 per 1,000. As yet it has been possible to do little to check the spread of the disease. With the authority of H.E. the High Commissioner, a Leper Settlement was formed in 1912, about 4 miles from Maseru for the segregation and care of all lepers within the Territory.

**Population and Industry.**

In 1875 when Basutoland formed part of the Cape Colony, at the general census of the Colony taken in that year, the European population of Basutoland was 499, and the native 127,707. At the census of 1901 the population was estimated at 647 Europeans and 263,400 natives.

| Census, 1911. |
|---------------|
| Natives       | ... | ... | 403,111 |
| Whites        | ... | ... | 1,396  |
| Total         |     |     | 404,507 |

Maseru, the capital, and largest town, has a population of 861 natives and 500 whites (these figures are unaudited returns).

The productions are wool, wheat, mealies, and Kaffir corn. There are indications of iron and copper, and coal has been found and used in some parts.

**History.**

The Basutos appear to have been composed of the remnants of several tribes which were broken up in the wars waged by Mosilikatze, the king of the Matabele, in the early years of the last century. These remnants were united in about 1818 under Mosheesh, a chief of great ability, who ruled for many years.

In 1852 war broke out between Mosheesh and the British Government; the Basutos were defeated by Sir G. Cathcart at the battle of the Berea Mountain, and Mosheesh sent in his submission, and made peace.

A few years later, in 1856, disputes arose between Mosheesh and the Orange Free State respecting boundary questions, and hostilities resulted which lasted from 1856 to 1858, with indecisive results, and were concluded by the Treaty of Alwal, 1858, but collisions frequently recurred.

In 1865 the war broke out afresh, and Mosheesh again claimed the protection of the Governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse. He declined to interpose actively, but despatched a British Commissioner to Thaba Bosigo, the capital of Basutoland, to settle the difficulties. This measure met with little success, and in the end the Boers were successful, and Mosheesh sued for peace. At the treaty of Thaba Bosigo, April, 1866, he recognised the permanent cession of a portion of his district and acknowledged himself a subject of the Orange Free State.

The peace was of short duration, the war was renewed, and the Basutos, pressed by the Boers, were on the brink of destruction, when they again appealed to be taken under the authority of the Queen, and in January, 1868, Sir Philip Wodehouse received authority to recognise Mosheesh and his tribe as British subjects, and for the incorporation of their territory. This was carried into effect by a proclamation dated March 12th, 1868.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition, until it was annexed to the Cape, by an Act of the Cape Legislature, No. 12 of 1871. The Act expressly declared that Basutoland was not to be
subject to the general law of the Colony, and gave the Governor power to legislate for it by proclamation, and to extend to it by proclamation any Cape Act not otherwise in force therein.

The subsequent history of Basutoland was one of much trouble and disturbance.

In March, 1879, Moiroi, the chief of the Quithing district, in the south-east of Basutoland, rescued from justice his son Doda, who had been arrested for horse-stealing; and, on the Colonial authorities demanding his surrender, broke out into open defiance of its authority. Owing to the great natural strength of his country and stronghold, considerable difficulty was experienced in subduing him; but in December of that year his stronghold was carried by storm, and he himself fell in the assault. The proposals of the Colonial Government to divide the territory occupied by the adherents of this chief into lots for occupation by European settlers gave rise to great discontent among the Basutos who had remained loyal. This discontent was further increased by the extension of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, providing for a general disarmament, to Basutoland by proclamation in April, 1880, and culminated in the revolt of almost the whole tribe when an attempt was made to put the Act in force. The rebellion spread to the native territories east and south of Basutoland, East Griqualand, Tambookieland, and the Pondomisi, where the rising was signalled by the treacherous murder of Mr. Hope, the magistrate, and other Europeans.

Strenuous efforts were made by the Colony to reduce the Basutos to submission by force of arms, but without decisive success, though the loss of their cattle, and the interruption of cultivation, caused great distress amongst them. Early in 1881 overtures for an arrangement were made by the leading chiefs, and, at the instance of Her Majesty's Government, the High Commissioner acted as arbiter between the Colonial Government and the Basutos.

The terms of his award were, the registration of arms, the payment of compensation to those natives who had remained loyal by the tribe, and also the payment of a fine of 5,000 head of cattle. The award, was accepted by the Basutos and the fine paid, but little was done towards fulfilling the other conditions. The Colonial Ministry, with a view to facilitate a settlement, cancelled the award and induced the Cape Parliament to assume the burden of compensating the loyalists. The Disarmament Proclamation was also repealed, and at a Pitso held on the 24th of April, 1883, a very liberal constitution was offered to the Basutos. Masupha, however, the chief of the Berea district, with several other chiefs of influence, held aloof, and practically declared their intention to have no further connection with the Colonial Government, and the tribe generally were understood to wish to be under the direct authority of the Imperial Government. In the meantime a strong feeling in favour of the entire abandonment of Basutoland had grown up in the Colony, and on the request of the Colonial Ministry the Imperial Government decided to undertake for a time the administration of the country on condition that satisfactory evidence was given by the Basutos of their desire to remain under the British Crown, that the Orange Free State should undertake to cause the frontier to be respected by its subjects, and that the Colony should pay over towards the cost of administration the Customs duties received on goods imported into Basutoland. This offer was accepted by the Colony, and provision was made in the Basutoland Disannexation Act of 1883 for the payment of 20,000£ a year, and the Free State also intimated its willingness to comply with the conditions so far as it was concerned.

A great national Pitso of the Basutos was held on the 29th of November, 1883, attended by the representatives of more than two-thirds of the whole tribe, who unanimously expressed their willingness to comply with the conditions on which the Imperial Government was prepared to assume the responsibility of the administration of the country. Several important chiefs who were not at the Pitso subsequently expressed their concurrence in this resolution, Masupha alone refusing to accept the offers of the Government, and desiring to remain independent. Her Majesty's Government upon this decided that their conditions were sufficiently complied with, advised the Queen to sanction the Disannexation Act, and immediately took steps for carrying on the government under the immediate authority of the Crown, from the 13th March, 1884. Masupha tendered his submission in 1886, and asked for a magistrate to be resident in his district.

**Constitution.**

The territory is now governed by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for South Africa, the latter possessing the legislative authority, which is exercised by proclamation.

The chiefs adjudicate on cases between natives, with a right of appeal to the Magistrates' Courts, where all cases between the natives and Europeans are brought.

For fiscal and other purposes the country is divided into 7 districts, namely, Maseru, Leribe, Mohale's Hoek, Berea, Mafetong, Quithing, and Qacha's Nek. Each of the districts is subdivided into wards, presided over by hereditary chiefs allied to the Moshehe family. The revenue arises from the post office, native tax, the sale of licences, and customs.

Serious crime is rare, and the drinking habits, which threatened to destroy the people, have been to a great extent abandoned owing to the influence of the missionaries, and the Government. There is not a single canteen in the country. The area under arable cultivation steadily increases, and there is less and less tendency to stock-thieving and petty warfare.

**Education.**

Excellent work is being carried on in the country by missionaries, in whose hands the labour of education is almost exclusively vested. There are 251 schools, with 15,397 scholars, a very large proportion being in the schools of the French Protestant Mission. There are four small Government schools, and grants in aid of education to the extent of 10,139£ were made for the year 1911-12.

**Means of Communication.**

There are no navigable waterways, the rivers being low in winter and flooded generally in summer. The usual mode of conveyance is by ox-waggon or light cart.

The roads in the country are now in good condition for any kind of transport, but the periodical rains draining down from the high watersheds seriously damage them. Bridges have been constructed across the Hlotse river, the Khomo-khoana river, the Caledon river at Ficksburg...
and the Little Caledon river near Maseru. A road and railway bridge has been built across the Caledon river at Maseru. New bridges have been made across the Phutatsana river near Teyateyaneng and the Mekhaleng river near Mohale's Hoek, and over the Tsoseng and Tlametlu streams in Maseru district. There are no railways through the country, but in December, 1905, the Central South African Railways opened a branch line running from Marseilles station on their Bloemfontein-Modderpoort line to a point just within the Basutoland border, and close to Maseru.

The line of postal communication is through the Cape Province and Orange Free State Province. Letters to and from Europe take about 20 days, to Cape Town 3 days. Postal rates are similar to those of the Cape Province. The parcels post and money order systems have been extended to Basutoland. The telegraph stations are Hlotse Heights, Teyateyaneng, Maseru, Morija, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Quthing, while a Government telephone line runs throughout the country to all Government stations.

Trade.

Imports for the year ended 31st December, 1908, amounted to £239,830., and the exports were estimated at £193,122. The imports consist chiefly of blankets, ploughs, saddlery, clothing, iron and tin ware, and groceries.

The exports consist chiefly of grain, cattle, wool, and horses. The commercial intercourse is almost exclusively with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State Province.

Basutoland from the 1st July, 1891, was admitted into a Customs Union with the Cape Province and the Orange Free State, by which arrangement a share of Customs duties collected at the ports of the Cape Province was credited to Basutoland, but retained by the Cape Government on account of the annual contribution of £18,000. Basutoland now receives, by arrangement, a proportion of Customs Revenue collected by the Union Government (see under South Africa, "Customs").

The High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 10 of Aug. 5th, 1903, declared the admission of Basutoland into a South African Customs Union in terms of the Convention entered into in that year between Cape Province, Natal, the O.R.C. Transvaal, Southern Rhodesia, Basutoland, and Bechuanaland Protectorate. A new Convention was signed in 1906, but the position of Basutoland as a member of the Union remained unchanged.

Currency and Banking.

The Standard Bank has opened a branch in Maseru, and there are branches of Post Office Savings Bank at most of the Government Stations. The currency is exclusively British, but exchange, and occasionally the payment of taxes, is still largely conducted by barter.

BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE.

Situation and Area.

The territory of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the South and East by the Union of South Africa, on the North by Southern Rhodesia and the Zambesi and Chobe Rivers, and on the West by German territory. Its area is estimated at about 275,000 square miles, and the population, according to the census taken on the 7th of May, 1911, was 125,350, of whom 1,692 were Europeans or white.

History.

During the year 1885, Sir Charles Warren, who was in command of an expedition despatched from England to pacify Southern Bechuanaland, where for some time previously hostilities had been proceeding between the Bechuans and Boers from the South African Republic, visited the principal chiefs in Northern Bechuanaland (known
as the Bechuanaland Protectorate), Khama, Gaseitse, and Sebele, and as a result a British Protectorate was proclaimed over their territories. No further steps were taken until the year 1891, when, by an Order in Council dated 9th May, the limits of the Bechuanaland Protectorate were more clearly defined, and the High Commissioner was authorised to appoint such officers as might appear to him to be necessary to provide for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and generally for the peace, order, and good government of all persons within the limits of the Order. Sir Sidney Shippard, the Administrator of Bechuanaland, was appointed Resident Commissioner, and an Assistant Commissioner was appointed for the Northern Protectorate, and another for the Southern Protectorate.

For fiscal and several other purposes the Protectorate was treated as a portion of the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland, until the latter was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 15th November, 1895. In the autumn of that year arrangements were made for the transfer of the administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, with the exception of certain reserves for native chiefs, to the British South African Company, and the Company's police were moved down to a camp in the Protectorate at Pitsani Potloglo. On the 29th of December Dr. Jameson, with his police, crossed the border of the South African Republic and marched towards Johannesburg, which was at the time in a state of great unrest, but being defeated by the Boers at Doornkop, surrendered on the 2nd January, 1896. In consequence of the raid, the administration of the Protectorate was not transferred to the Company. Since the annexation of British Bechuanaland to the Cape the Protectorate has been governed as a separate territory under the name of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, and the form of government is very similar to that which obtains in Basutoland. There is a Resident Commissioner, who is under the direction of the High Commissioner, and there are two Assistant Commissioners, one stationed at Francistown, in the Northern Protectorate, and the other at Gaberones, in the Southern Protectorate. For the maintenance of law and order there is a force of police known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate Police, numbering 176. This force is under the direct control of the Resident Commissioner. There are 14 officers, 52 European non-commissioned officers and men, and 73 Basuto non-commissioned officers and men. There are also 40 Bechuans employed as messengers, and it is proposed to increase their number. The police are stationed in small detachments at various places in the Protectorate. The headquarters of the Administration is at Mafeking, in the Cape Province.

Climate and Industries.

The climate is delightful during the winter and fairly healthy during seven months of the year. During the summer months malarial fever is generally prevalent.

The Protectorate is essentially a pastoral country, and although mealies and Kaffir corn are reaped by the natives in large quantities when the season is favourable, the rainfall is insufficient, or perhaps too uneven and uncertain in its distribution, to render agriculture anything but a hazardous pursuit. The staple product consists of horned cattle which according to the census in 1912 numbered 323,911. There were at the same time 388,336 sheep and goats. A large quantity of fire-wood is exported by rail from the Southern Protectorate, chiefly to Kimberley, and a considerable quantity of timber suitable for mining props is also sent out of the country. Precautions are taken to see that none other than dead wood is exported for fuel, and that in felling trees for mining purposes only those of a certain size are used and only a certain limited number cut down in each locality. In the North, in the Tati district, gold mining has been carried on, on a small scale, for years. During the year 1911, 5,475 ozs. valued at £22,242l. were produced.

Native Chiefs.

The principal chiefs are:—
Khama, Chief of the Bamangwato, whose chief town is Serowe.
Sechele, Chief of the Bakwena, who lives at Molopoole.
Gaseitsewe, Chief of the Bangwaketsi, who lives at Kanye.
Linchiwe, Chief of the Bakhatlai, who lives at Mochudi.
Matibhe, Chief of the Batawana, who lives at Lake N'gami, near which at Tsau there is a Resident Magistrate and a small detachment of police under a sub-inspector.
Baitlotle, Chief of the Bamalete, who lives at Ramoutsu.

Means of Communication.

The main trunk railway to the North, which connects Rhodesia with Cape Town and which has now been extended beyond the Victoria Falls, runs through the Protectorate. The line north of Vryburg in the Cape Province is the property of the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, to whom, under an agreement made in 1894, the Protectorate Government was to pay a subsidy of 20,000l. a year for ten years, which has now lapsed.

Finances.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1905-6 | £28,663 | £74,783 |
| 1906-7 | 29,047 | 77,111 |
| 1907-8 | 31,663 | 75,851 |
| 1908-9 | 42,050 | 75,801 |
| 1909-10 | 49,788 | 65,268 |
| 1910-11 | 52,067 | 64,791 |
| 1911-12 | 59,305 | 65,936 |

There is no public debt, the annual deficiency being made good by an Imperial grant-in-aid.

The estimated expenditure for the year ending the 31st March, 1913, is £65,172l., and the estimated revenue £50,200l. The deficiency will be met from the balance brought forward from the previous year. For the first time in the history of the Protectorate there will be no Imperial grant-in-aid. The revenue is derived principally from Customs and Hut Tax, and the chief item of expenditure is police. Except in the case of importations from German South West Africa, no customs duty is collected in the Protectorate, but under an Agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Customs revenue, calculated on the average receipts for three completed years prior to Union, is received from the Union Treasury.

SWAZILAND.

Situation and Area.

Swaziland is bounded on the North, West, and South by the Transvaal, and on the East by Portuguese territory and Tongaland, now part of Natal.

Its area is approximately 6,536 square miles.

Description and Climate.

The territory is divided geographically into three longitudinal regions.

The mountainous region on the West approximates an altitude of over 4,000 feet.

What is known as the Middle Veld is some 2,000 feet lower, while the Low Veld, bounded on the East by the Lebombo Mountains, attains an average altitude of not more than 1,000 feet. The first two regions are well watered and healthy, but the Low Veld cannot be described as either.

Mbabane, the headquarters of the Administration, is situated on the hills at an altitude of 4,300 feet, and Bremerstorp, the old capital, is on the Middle Veld. There are no other European villages.

History.

Swaziland, known to the natives as "Kwangwane," has been in the occupation of the Swazi tribes for a considerable period, and the present Ama-Swazi are no doubt the descendants of the early Bantu invaders, who occupied the country contemporaneously with the occupation of adjacent territory by allied tribes. The history of the consolidation into a nation of a congeries of tribes dates from early in the eighteenth century, when the adoption of a military organisation led to the dominance of one tribe over the others.

Certain "Medicine" and rain cattle were captured from Sikukuni by the Swazis, who lent assistance in the operations against that chief in the time of the first British occupation of the Transvaal, and the possession of this rain medicine has invested the paramount chief of Swaziland, in the minds of the natives of South Africa, with high authority as a rain maker.

The Swazis, while strong enough to repel a Zulu invasion, were nevertheless subject to the aggression of these neighbours, who, with the Boers, claimed authority over the country. In the Conventions of Pretoria (1881), and London (1884) Her Majesty's Government, however, expressly stipulated for the independence of Swaziland.

During the eighties the King "Mbandini" granted concessions for certain sums and periods. Every conceivable right was granted away, not only for land, minerals, grazing, and timber, but also for all imaginable purposes, including exemption from taxes, railways, telegraphs, mining patents, collection of the King's revenue, trading, etc., etc. All unallotted lands and minerals also formed the subject of concessions.

In 1888 a charter of self-government was granted to the whites in the country. Later, in 1890, under a Convention between Her Majesty's Government and the South African Republic, a provisional Government was, with the consent of the Swazis, set up, consisting of a Government Committee composed of representatives of those two Powers, and a representative of the Swazis, a Government Secretary, and of a Chief Court. This Court adjudicated on the initial validity of all concessions granted by the King, and, with few exceptions, confirmed the grants in respect of such initial validity.

In accordance with pledges given to the Government of the South African Republic the provisional Administration came to an end three years later, when the British Government signed a fresh Convention, which permitted the South African Republic to acquire from the Regent and her Council an Organic Proclamation conferring on the South African Republic rights of jurisdiction, legislation and administration without incorporation in the South African Republic. The Swazis never signed the Organic Proclamation which had been drafted for them, and accordingly its provisions, with some of those in the 1893 Convention, were embodied in the final Convention of 1894, under which the South African Republic exercised powers of protection, legislation, jurisdiction and administration in Swaziland, subject to the limitations of the Convention.

On the conquest of the Transvaal, all the rights and powers of the late South African Republic passed to His Majesty, but since the other party to the Convention of 1894 had disappeared without the limitations therein, an Order in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act was issued in June, 1903, providing that the Governor of the Transvaal should administer Swaziland, and conferring on him the right to legislate by Proclamation.

On the cessation of hostilities a British Special Commissioner, with a small force of South African Constabulary, was sent into the country, and a provisional Administration was established.

In accordance with the powers granted to him, the Governor issued a Proclamation in 1904 providing for administration and for dealing with the concessions question. The Laws of the
Transvaal in force at that date of the Proclamation were applied to Swaziland, mutatis mutandis. Courts were established with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the Transvaal, and an appeal was permitted from the decisions of the chiefs in civil matters to the Court of the Resident Magistrate. The chiefs were otherwise confirmed in their civil jurisdiction over natives, subject to the exclusion of usages incompatible with the due exercise of His Majesty's power and jurisdiction, or clearly injurious to the welfare of the natives.

The Commission constituted under the Proclamation of 1904 to deal with the concessions examined the concessions granting exclusive rights, except exclusive rights to land and minerals, with a view to their expropriation at their value prior to the commencement of hostilities. The Commission reported in 1906, and the concessions, the subject of its report, were, with a few exceptions, expropriated. The Commission has now dealt with the question of boundaries of land, mineral and grazing concessions. The general survey of these concessions, necessary to determine the conflicting rights, is now complete. The Proclamation of 1904 further provided for the settlement of the rights of the natives, which in a modified form, is now completed.

By an Order in Council, dated 1st December, 1906, His Majesty's Government transferred the control of Swaziland from the Governor of the Transvaal to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Under the Order in Council the High Commissioner issued a Proclamation in March, 1907, providing for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, a Government Secretary, Assistant Commissioners and the establishment of a Police Force. The Laws of the Transvaal were re-enacted, mutatis mutandis, and, except where modified by Statute, the Roman-Dutch Common Law was put in force by the Proclamation. A special Court, having the full jurisdiction of a Superior Court, was established together with Courts of Assistant Commissioners with a limited jurisdiction.

The paramount chief and other chiefs were confirmed in their Civil Jurisdiction over natives subject to appeal to the Resident Commissioner. Provision was made for the Swaziland Deeds Office and Surveyor-General's Office to remain at Pretoria under control of the officers responsible prior to the date of the Proclamation.

Population.

The population of Swaziland is, according to the census of 1911, 98,876 coloured.

The Swazi are a kindred race to the Zulu. They have easily accessible markets for their labour, both locally and in the Transvaal, but their efforts in this direction are spasmodic.

The paramount chief is "Sobhuza," a boy of about fourteen years of age. His grandmother, "Nabotsibeni," widow of "Mbandini," acts as Regent, and has the assistance of a council of chiefs. A few of the principal chiefs are:

- Nogocogo Dhlamini, brother of Mbandini.
- Jokovu Dhlamini.
- Malunge Dhlamini, son of Mbandini.
- Ndabazezwe Dhlamini.
- Silelo Neubande.
- Makambane Fakude.
- Sihielo Madhluli.
- Nthahingili Simelana.
- Tikuba Dhlamini.

The English Church Mission, The South Africa General Mission, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission, the African Methodist Episcopal Mission, the Wesleyan Methodist Mission, the Independent Methodist Mission, and the American International Holiness Union have representatives in the country.

The Administration has a native school at Zombodi, the kraal of the Regent, at which the young paramount chief attends, and has schools for European children at Mbabane, Bremerdorp, Ferreira's, Hluti, Paradys and Driefontein.

Industries, Agriculture & Trade.

Mining in Swaziland is carried on under the authority of Concessions granted by the late King Mbandini. Gold is worked at several Mines near the western border. Tin is found in payable quantities in the vicinity of Mbabane. The Crown owns a few mineral areas, some of which it is proposed to throw open to the public for prospecting and mining. The following is the output of tin and gold for the last five years.

| Year | Tin (tons) | Valued at (£) |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1907-8 | 535       | £49,588      |
| 1903-9 | 526       | £42,005      |
| 1909-10| 446       | £28,368      |
| 1910-11| 476       | £42,250      |
| 1911-12| 313       | £32,397      |

| Year | Gold (ounces) | Valued at (£) |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| 1907-8 | 3,108        | £13,203     |
| 1908-9 | 6,749        | £28,669     |
| 1909-10| 11,202       | £46,707     |
| 1910-11| 13,543       | £57,530     |
| 1911-12| 14,781       | £32,783     |

The native crops consist of maize, millet, sweet potatoes, ground nuts, etc., grown in insufficient quantities to meet local demands. With the completion of the general survey of Concessions and the definition of rights a decided advance in farming by Europeans has taken place. The Government has disposed to farmers who will give beneficial occupation, numerous small blocks of Crown Land suitable for agricultural farming. Experiments have been conducted in cotton growing with encouraging results. Tobacco is grown in small quantities and has given a good return. The Government Horticulturist of the Transvaal has reported very favourably on the prospects of fruit growing. He was especially impressed with the suitability of the climate and soil for citrus fruits and mangoes.

There are approximately 59,000 head of horned stock, and 170,000 native sheep and goats in the territory. Over 100,000 sheep (Merinos) are brought in each year from the high veld for winter grazing, but this class of sheep is not farmed in Swaziland during the summer months.

No statistics of the imports into and the exports from Swaziland are now kept. By an agreement with the Government of the Union of South Africa, Swaziland is dealt with, for Customs purposes, as a part of the Union. Payments due to Swaziland are assessed on the proportions which the average of the collections for the three years ended March 31st, 1910, bear to the total customs collections of the Union in each year. The imports consist principally of maize, flour, groceries, wearing apparel, hardware, spirits and tobacco; while the principal exports are Cassiterite Tin and Raw Gold.

There is a branch of the National Bank of South Africa, Limited, at Mbabane, as also a Post Office Savings Bank. The currency is British.
Stores exist where necessary to serve the needs of the population, but the volume of trade is small.

Revenue and Expenditure.

The revenue and expenditure for the year ended March 31st, 1912, was

Revenue - 57,307l.*
Expenditure - 62,192l.†

The public debt on March 31st, 1912, was 100,000l.

RHODESIA.*

Rhodesia (so called after the late Right Hon. Cecil J. Rhodes) is the name of the country under the administration of the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in its Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese Dominions." Of these extensive territories the Company is now responsible for the administration of the following portions:

1. Southern Rhodesia, or the provinces of Mashonaland and Matabeleland (area 148,575 square miles).
2. Northern Rhodesia, or the whole of the British sphere lying between the Portuguese Settlements, German East Africa, and the Congo State, with the exception of the strip of territory forming the Nyasaland Protectorate. The area is estimated at about 291,000 square miles.

I.—SOUTHERN RHODESIA.

The limits of Southern Rhodesia, as defined by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, dated 20th October, 1898, are the parts of South Africa bounded by the Portuguese Possessions, by the Transvaal Colony to a point opposite the mouth of the River Shashi, by the River Shashi to its junction with the Tatì and Ramaquaban rivers, thence by the Ramaquaban river to its source, thence by the watershed to the Rivers Shashi and Ramaquaban until such watershed strikes the Hunter's Road (called the Pandamantenka Road), thence by that road to the River Zambesi, and by that river to the Portuguese boundary. The said limits include an area of ten

miles' radius round Fort Tuli, but exclude the area of the district known as the Tati district as defined by the Charter.

II.—NORTHERN RHODESIA.

This territory was previously divided into two provinces:

(a.) Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia.
(b.) North-Eastern Rhodesia.

By the order in Council, dated 4th May, 1911, these two provinces were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. The amalgamation took effect from 17th August, 1911. The limits of the territory as defined by the order in Council are "the parts of Africa bounded by Southern Rhodesia, German South-West Africa, Portuguese West Africa, the Congo Free State, German East Africa, Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa."

History.

On the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce, and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Early in 1890 a police force of Europeans was raised and equipped, and in June of that year, after obtaining permission from King Lobengula, a pioneer expedition on a large scale was organised to cut a road from a point on the Mcloutsie River, a tributary of the Limpopo, through the south-eastern part of Matabeleland into Mashonaland, the objective point of the expedition being Mount Hampden, near which large belts of gold-bearing quartz were known to exist. This point was duly reached, and Fort Salisbury, 12 miles South-east of Mount Hampden, having been founded (12th September, 1890) the pioneers were disbanded, and, in accordance with the agreement made with them, were allowed to peg off auriferous claims and farms.

In July, 1893, the Matabele made a raid into Mashonaland, and killed several natives living under the Company's protection, near Victoria, when they were attacked and driven back by the Company's police. After an unsuccessful attempt to arrange matters, preparations were made for the invasion of Matabeleland, to anticipate an expected attack on the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Mashonaland. The Company's police and a large force of volunteers and native allies advanced on Bulawayo from the north and east, while the Bechuanaland Police, which had been largely reinforced, advanced with Khami and some 2,000 of his men by way of Tati from the south. Two successful engagements were fought by the Company's forces near Bulawayo, in which the Matabele suffered very severely. The Bechuanaland police were also attacked by a strong force of Matabele, which they repulsed with great loss. Lobengula fled, and Bulawayo was occupied, and a force sent in pursuit of the king.

This force was unfortunately divided by the sudden rising of the River Shangani, and Major Wilson and a small party of men were, after a heroic resistance, killed to a man. Arrangements for the future administration of the country were completed by the High Commissioner and Mr. Rhodes on behalf of the Company. Lobengula, who was said to be endeavouring to escape across the Zambesi, is reported to have died from small-pox or fever.

In 1896, owing to a variety of causes, the Matabele broke out in rebellion, and shortly after the Mashonas followed suit. After a prolonged struggle the rebellion was subdued in September, 1907.

The rinderpest, which for several years had been devastating Africa, travelling slowly through the continent from north to south, made its first appearance in Matabeleland in February, 1896. The adoption of the drastic regulations which the administration decided to enforce had to some extent checked the progress of the epidemic, when the outbreak of the rebellion put a stop to all precautionary measures.

In March, 1898, a system of compulsory inoculation for rinderpest was established, and the precautions taken have proved very effective.

From 1897 to 1899 the development of the country advanced rapidly, but the outbreak of the war with the Republics, in October, 1899, practically put a stop to progressive work of every kind, and for months the territory was completely cut off from the south.

On the outbreak of hostilities Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir Robert) Baden-Powell was in supreme command of all the forces in Southern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. When Mafeking was invested the command of the Rhodesian forces devolved upon Colonel (now Lieut.-General Sir H. C.) Plumer, who was stationed at Tuli with a force of 450 men. In November, 1899, Martial Law was proclaimed in certain districts in Matabeleland, and, at a later date, in the whole territory, and the Southern Rhodesian Volunteers to the number of 800, were called out for active service.

At the beginning of January, 1900, Colonel Plumer moved his column to Palachwe and assumed direct command of the troops in the Protectorate, amongst whom were included 600 Volunteers and over 400 men of the British South Africa Police. Mafeking was successfully relieved by Mahon and Plumer's united columns on the 17th May.

In the early part of 1900 a force of 5,000 men, consisting of Australian, New Zealand and Canadian Volunteers, and English Yeomanry, was despatched to Rhodesia, via Beira, under the command of General Sir Frederick Carrington. This force was sent to the front as speedily as possible, two companies of Militia Infantry being retained at Bulawayo as a garrison.

The Administration of Southern Rhodesia estimated that the number of men contributed by Rhodesia was approximately 1,500, being at least 12½ per cent. of the European population. Despatches which have been published bear testimony to the good work performed by the Volunteers, Police, and the Rhodesia Regiment, and they also gained the special approbation of the late Commander-in-Chief.

The attitude of the natives throughout the war was most satisfactory, and, although in some districts there appeared signs of unrest, it was confined to attempts by discontented natives to work up the feelings of the people, who were, however, not affected by them to any appreciable degree.

Martial Law in Southern Rhodesia was withdrawn on the 26th July, 1902.
Constitution.

In 1888 that portion of Rhodesia now known as Southern Rhodesia was declared to be within the British sphere of influence, and on the 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company, conferring upon it large powers of administration to carry out the objects for which it was formed.

At an Extraordinary General Meeting of the shareholders of the British South Africa Company, held on the 14th of December, 1899, a resolution was passed agreeing to accept the amendments proposed by Her Majesty's Government to be made in the original Charter of the Company by a Supplemental Charter, and a further resolution was passed approving certain alterations in the original Deed of Settlement of the Company. These resolutions were confirmed at a further Extraordinary General Meeting, held on the 16th of January, 1900.

The Constitution of Southern Rhodesia, originally laid down by the Charter, was subsequently amended by the Orders in Council of the 4th May, 1891; 30th July, 1891; and 18th July, 1894, the latter being known as the "Matabeleland Order in Council." This Order was revoked by the Southern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1898, which provides for the Administration of the Territory, Legislation, the Preservation of Peace and Order, the Constitution of Courts of Justice, and Native Administration. This Order has been amended by the Southern Rhodesia Orders in Council of the 16th February, 1903, 10th August, 1909, and 4th May, 1911. Under the Order of 1898, as amended, there is a Resident Commissioner appointed by the Secretary of State. To assist the Administrator there is an Executive Council, composed of not less than three members appointed by the Company, with the approval of the Secretary of State. A member of the Executive Council holds office for a period of three years, unless sooner removed by the Company, but is eligible for re-appointment at the end of each term of office. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of the Administrator (President), five nominees of the Company approved by the Secretary of State, and seven members elected by the Registered Voters. The Resident Commissioner sits on both the Executive and Legislative Councils, but without a vote. Ordinances passed by the Legislative Council, when assented to by the High Commissioner, take effect immediately, but within a year may be disallowed by the Secretary of State. The duration of each Legislative Council is three years. The first Legislative Council was elected in 1899. The number of Registered Voters in 1910 was 6,534.

By a Proclamation, dated 10th June, 1891, the laws of the Cape Colony in force on that date were adopted for and are administered in Southern Rhodesia as far as the circumstances of the country will permit, unless amended or repealed by the Legislative Council. The laws of the Cape Colony passed subsequent to the 10th June, 1891, do not apply to Rhodesia.

For the administration of justice there is a High Court with civil and criminal jurisdiction, the judges being appointed by the Secretary of State, on the nomination of the Company. In the districts there are Magistrates' Courts. Appeals from the High Court lie to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope, and thence to the Privy Council.

The administrative system of Northern Rhodesia is prescribed by the Northern Rhodesia Order in Council of 4th May, 1911.

Local Government.

Salisbury and Bulawayo were constituted municipalities in October, 1897. Sanitary Boards are appointed for the other principal towns.

Native Administration.

The Native Department of Southern Rhodesia is administered by the Secretary for Native Affairs, the duties of the office at the present time being undertaken by the Administrator. The two provinces are each under the control of a Chief Native Commissioner (who is responsible to the Secretary for Native Affairs), and are divided into native districts, 19 in Mashonaland and 13 in Matabeleland. Each district is in charge of a Native Commissioner or Assistant Native Commissioner, who is appointed by the Administrator, with the approval of the High Commissioner, as laid down in the "Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898," and whose duties are defined by the High Commissioner's Proclamation, No. 55 of 1910 (promulgated 14th October, 1910).

Formerly the natives were scattered throughout the country, but now land has been reserved for tribal settlements which is suitable for their agricultural and pastoral requirements.

The only tax imposed upon them is an annual hut-tax of 1l. Excellent provision has been made for those who go to work at the mines. Compounds have been erected and hospitals provided at most of the mines, which are periodically visited by Government Inspectors; their contracts are supervised by officials who see that the terms are faithfully fulfilled by the employers, and in the event of injustice they have their remedy in a court of law under the "Master's and Servant's Ordinance." A native at the mines can easily earn from 30s. to 3l. a month with food and lodging.

Climate.

The Rhodesian plateau lies at an altitude of from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. Broadly speaking, the year has two divisions, the wet and the dry season. The early rains of the wet season (which is the summer) gradually appear towards the end of October, and increase in frequency and force until about the end of April. From May to September there is practically no rain. Taking into consideration the vast extent of the territory the climate naturally varies. In the highlands it is very healthy and bracing. Formerly, in the low-lying districts, malarial fever was very prevalent, but with the opening up of the country, better housing and food, it is rapidly disappearing. The summer is not oppressively hot, nor is the winter very cold. The average shown by the maximum and minimum thermometers in the shade at the principal towns, during 1910, was:

| Location | Max. | Min. |
|----------|------|------|
| Salisbury | 76°8 | 51°2 |
| Umtali   | 80°6 |      |
| Bulawayo | 76°7 | 53°3 |

Rainfall.

1910.

| Location | Rainfall |
|----------|----------|
| Salisbury | 28·14 inches |
| Umtali   | 23·87    |
| Bulawayo | 17·95    |

There are hospitals at Salisbury, Bulawayo, Umtali, Victoria, and Gwelo, each supplied with
a complete staff of doctors and nurses. Cottage hospitals have also been erected in various districts to meet the wants of the mining centres.

**Population.**

A census for Southern Rhodesia was taken on the 7th May, 1911, showing the number of Europeans to be 23,606 (Mashonaland, 12,631; Matabeleland, 10,975). The native population was 744,559 (Mashonaland, 495,451; Matabeleland, 249,108). There were also 2,912 Asiatics and other coloured persons. The European population of Northern Rhodesia on the same date was 1,497, and the native population is estimated at 821,102.

**Chief Towns.**

The chief towns of Southern Rhodesia are Salisbury (the capital), Umtali and Victoria in Mashonaland; and Bulawayo, Gwelo and Tuli in Matabeleland. Townships have also been formed at Rusapi, Gwanda, Solukwe, Hartley, Enkeldoorn, Melesetter, Gatooms, Umvuma and at other places. Salisbury, the seat of the Government, has a white population of 3,479. The town stands 4,700 feet above sea level. Branches of the Standard Bank, Bank of Africa, and African Banking Corporation have been established.

Bulawayo is the commercial centre of Southern Rhodesia, with a white population of 5,200 and stands 4,469 feet above the sea level. Branches of the same banks as at Salisbury have been opened. There is a municipal hospital, which is one of the finest in South Africa. The town is on the main line of railway from Cape Town to the far north, and is distant from Cape Town 1,362 miles.

**Railways.**

The Bechuanaland Railways (now Rhodesia Railways, Limited) reached Bulawayo on the 19th October, 1897, and the line to that town was formally opened on the 4th November. An extension of the Beira Railway from Umtali reached Salisbury on the 1st May, 1899, and was opened on the 22nd May. On the 1st August, 1900, the widening of the gauge of the Beira Railway to 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa, was completed. On the 6th October, 1902, the line was completed between Salisbury and Bulawayo, a distance of 301 miles, thus establishing through communication between Cape Town and Beira (over 2,000 miles). The line passes through the mining districts of Hartley, Sebakwe, Gwelo, Bembesi, etc. The railway from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls (282 miles) on the River Zambesi was completed on the 25th April, 1904, and the further extension northward, via Kalomo, to the Broken Hill Mine, 374 miles from the Falls, was opened for traffic on 1st September, 1906. Another section of the line from Broken Hill to the Congo Border (132 miles) was completed in December, 1909, by the Rhodesia-Katanga Junction Railway and Mineral Company, Limited. There is, therefore, through communication between Cape Town and the northern border of North-Western Rhodesia, a total distance of 2,149 miles. A further extension to the Star of the Congo Mine, in the Congo State (167 miles), has been constructed by the Compagnie du Chemin de fer du Katanga. The Zambesi river is crossed by a bridge 650 feet long, 30 feet wide, and about 420 feet above the level of the water. The structure was formally opened by the late Sir G. H. Darwin, K.C.B., President of the British Association, on the 12th September, 1905. A line from Bulawayo to the West Nicholson mine in the Gwanda district (120 miles), to open up the gold and coal areas to the south-east, has been constructed, and a line, with a 2-feet gauge, from Salisbury to the Ayrshire Mine in the Lomagundi district (84 miles), was opened for traffic on the 1st November, 1902. A branch (12 miles) has been made from this line to the Eldorado Mine. These two branches are now being widened to standard gauge (3 ft. 6 in.). A line from Gwelo to Selukwe (24 miles) was completed in August, 1903, and one from Lyndhurst Halt (near Gwelo) to Umvuma (50 miles), was opened in June, 1909. A survey for the construction of a line from Umvuma to Victoria, a distance of 75 miles, has just been completed. A railway from Salisbury to the Jumbo Mine in the Mazoe district (about 22 miles) was recently opened for traffic and an extension of this line to Shamva in the Salisbury district, a distance of about 50 miles from the Jumbo Mine is now in the course of construction. A line to the Matopos, where Mr. Rhodes is buried, was opened for traffic on November 1st, 1903.

The total mileage of the Rhodesian Railway Systems (including the Beira Railway) at the end of 1912 was 2,357 miles.

**Lands and Agriculture.**

In 1897 a geodetic survey of Southern Rhodesia was initiated under the superintendence of Sir David Gill, K.C.B., H.M. Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, and was completed to the Zambesi river, in August, 1901.

Unimproved land in Southern Rhodesia may be purchased from the British South Africa Company outright for cash, subject to the fulfilment of a simple occupation condition, or it may be held under a permit of occupation with option of purchase for cash, or by instalments, at any time within ten years. The minimum price for this class of land is at present about 7s. 6d. an acre. The title deed gives the purchaser the freehold to the land subject to an annual payment of quit-rent, which is roughly 1/2 per 1,000 acres. Applications for land should be addressed to the Director of Land Settlement, Salisbury, Rhodesia. Information and handbooks can be supplied by the Rhodesian Emigration and Information Office, 138, Strand, London, W.C., or the Emigration and Information Office, 140, Buchanan Street, Glasgow.

Special steamship and railway facilities are given to bona fide farmer settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for the benefit of the farming community.

Considerable tracts of land have been placed under cultivation, and fresh stock is being imported. It may be said that virtually the whole of Southern Rhodesia is well watered, and adapted for stock-raising and for agriculture. Cattle generally do very well in all parts. Sheep and goats thrive in many parts and will do better after the grass is fed down. Pigs thrive well, and, so far, have never shown disease. Poultry and eggs always command a ready sale at remunerative prices. Throughout the country the conditions of soil and climate are suitable for all kinds of European cereals and vegetables, and, in addition, many trees, shrubs and plants peculiar to sub-tropical
regions can be successfully cultivated. Maize, Kaffir-corn, and other native cereals grow well in the rainy season without irrigation. Tobacco culture has now passed the experimental stage, and the industry is being rapidly developed. The plant grows luxuriantly, and a considerable acreage is under cultivation. There is every prospect of an early export trade being created in maize and tobacco, and later it is hoped to export other products such as fibres, rubber and cotton. Large fruit orchards have been planted, and nearly all fruit trees thrive. The sale of dairy produce is a profitable industry in the neighbourhood of the towns.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The mails from the United Kingdom to Southern Rhodesia are conveyed by the mail steamers of the subsidised Union-Castle Company, weekly, between Southampton and Table Bay. From Cape Town they are conveyed by train to Bulawayo in 2½ days. There are also daily mail and passenger trains from Cape Town to Bulawayo performing the journey in four days. From Bulawayo to Salisbury the mails are conveyed five times a week, the journey occupying about 20 hours. There are three mail and passenger trains weekly between Salisbury and Beira, the time occupied on the journey being 27½ hours.

The outlying districts of Southern Rhodesia are served by mail coaches and carts, but the mails to the less important districts are conveyed by native runners.

Northern Rhodesia receives its mails via Bulawayo. They are conveyed from Bulawayo to the Victoria Falls and Broken Hill by train, and to the several postal stations in the territory by native runners.

Mail matter may, however, still be forwarded to Fort Jameson and other stations in the Eastern portion of the territory by the Chinde and Blantyre route. The time occupied in the transmission of the mails between Fort Jameson and the United Kingdom is now five weeks and two days.

On the 31st of December, 1911, 86 post offices were open in Southern Rhodesia, at 35 of which Money Order and Savings Bank business was transacted. Telegraph Money Orders are also exchanged between Money Order Offices in Rhodesia and with the United Kingdom, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony.

The rate for inland letters is 1d. per ½ oz., and the same rate to other parts of South Africa. The rate for letters for places over-sea was reduced from 2½d. to 1d. per ½ oz. from 1st April, 1911. The rate for letters from the United Kingdom to Rhodesia is 1d. per oz.

The Rhodesian Telegraph and Telephone system extends from Ramathlabama, on the northern border of Cape Colony, to Ujiji in German East Africa, and comprises 7,935 miles of wire, on 4,404 miles of poles.

On the 31st December, 1911, 104 telegraph offices were open. The rate for Inland telegrams is 1d. per word; for telegrams exchanged between Rhodesia and other parts of South Africa, 2d. per word; and for cables to Europe is 2s. 8½d. per word. Telegrams from Europe and from South Africa, for the Portuguese province of Manica and Sofala, Portuguese East Africa (including Chinde and Quilimane), the Nyasaland Protectorate, North Eastern Rhodesia, and for German East Africa, all pass over the Rhodesian lines.

Telephone exchanges are in operation at 13 towns and mining centres.

Post Office Savings Banks were established on 1st January, 1905. Up to 31st December, 1911, the amount deposited was 481,641l., and the amount withdrawn was 370,889l. 112,542l. has been invested in Trustee Securities.

Customs.

Prior to the 1st August, 1899, no duties were leviable upon goods entering Southern Rhodesia. On that date the Customs Ordinance came into operation, and continued in force till August, 1903, when, as a result of the South African Customs Conference, the necessary Ordinance empowering Southern Rhodesia to enter the newly formed Customs Union was unanimously passed by the Legislative Council. This Convention of 1903 was superseded by that of 1906. The Tariff was amended in 1908. On the 30th June, 1910, the Customs Union was terminated by mutual consent, but an agreement has been entered into between Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa, by which the tariff remains unaltered. The following is the value of the declared imports into Southern Rhodesia during the past ten years, together with the amount of duty collected:

| Year ended | Value (£) | Duty (£) |
|------------|----------|---------|
| 31st March, 1903 | 1,858,569 | 128,673 |
| 1904 | 1,576,619 | 128,387 |
| 1905 | 951,698 | 105,934 |
| 31st Dec., 1905 | 1,213,776 | 128,250 |
| 1906 | 1,340,687 | 162,739 |
| 1907 | 1,450,174 | 171,120 |
| 1908 | 1,818,372 | 200,348 |
| 1909 | 2,214,014 | 213,693 |
| 1910 | 2,786,321 | 274,085 |
| 1911 | 2,975,112 | 316,139 |

Exports from Southern Rhodesia during the past five years:

| Year ended | Value (£) |
|------------|----------|
| 31st December, 1908 | ... | 2,718,476l. |
| 1909 | ... | 3,159,569l. |
| 1910 | ... | 3,018,099l. |
| 1911 | ... | 3,098,400l. |

An Ordinance was promulgated on 1st October, 1901, imposing a duty of 6s. per gallon on spirits manufactured in South Africa, and imported into the Territory. Another Ordinance was also promulgated upon the same date imposing an excise duty of a similar amount upon spirits manufactured within Southern Rhodesia.

Minerals.

GOLD.—That gold was obtained from Rhodesia many centuries before the Christian Era is evidenced from the innumerable "ancient workings," the ruins of temples and forts supposed to date from the time of the Himyarites and Phoenicians, and the discovery of gold beads, gold plates, fine chains, wire, nails, etc. From the occupation of the country in 1890 by the British South Africa Company when the European population amounted to about 200 persons, consisting of the pioneers and a few officials, up to September, 1898, the gold produced only amounted to 6,470 ounces. Since that date, however, the out-
put has been steadily increasing, and the following table shows the progress made during the last ten years:

| Year   | Bullion          | Estimated Value |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1902   | 194,170 ozs.     | 887,096         |
| 1903   | 231,872 ,,       | 827,729         |
| 1904   | 267,737 ,,       | 969,343         |
| 1905   | 407,048 ,,       | 1,449,985       |
| 1906   | 551,894 ,,       | 1,985,099       |
| 1907   | 612,052 ,,       | 2,178,886       |
|        | Fine Gold        |                 |
| 1908   | 606,961 ozs.     | 2,526,007       |
| 1909   | 623,389 ,,       | 2,623,708       |
| 1910   | 609,956 ,,       | 2,568,198       |
| 1911   | 628,521 ,,       | 2,647,896       |
| 1912   | 642,808 ,,       | 2,707,368       |

From the 1st April, 1908, all results are declared in ounces of fine gold instead of in bullion.

COAL.—For some years past coal has been known to exist in several districts. In the Wankie District, 212 miles from Bulawayo, and 70 miles from the Victoria Falls on the River Zambesi, a coal bed of large extent is being worked. The result of careful and systematic examination shows that as regards quality the coal is only from 4 to 6 per cent. inferior to Welsh steam coal of similar quality. During the year 1912 the output amounted to 216,140 tons, as against 212,529 tons in 1911. Other promising discoveries of coal have been made in the Victoria, Tuli and Sebungwe districts, also in North-Western Rhodesia, but, so far, sufficient exploratory work has not been carried out to admit of a final opinion being pronounced as to their precise value.

The output of silver during the year 1912 was 176,531 oz., and for 1911 187,641 oz. The output of lead in 1912 amounted to 590 tons.

COPPER.—Discoveries of copper have been reported in the Victoria, Lomagundi and Melsetter districts in Southern Rhodesia, and highly promising deposits have been disclosed in Northern Rhodesia. Tin has also been discovered in the Victoria and Salisbury districts in Southern Rhodesia.

During 1905 diamonds were discovered in the Gwelo district, and 7,020 carats had been declared up to the 31st December, 1911.

Amongst other minerals, 1.36 tons of wolframite ore, and 69,250 tons of chrome iron ore, have been exported up to 31st December, 1912.

Education.

On the 31st December, 1911, there were in Southern Rhodesia 39 state-aided schools. During the year nine new schools were opened and three were closed. The total number of children in Government-aided schools was 2,138 as against 1,623 for the previous year, an increase of nearly 32 per cent. The total expenditure from Government funds amounted to 42,788£., and 6,837£. was received in respect of tuition fees. The number of native schools which received Government grants during 1911 was 150 as compared with 115 for 1910.

In 1910 two High Schools (one for boys and one for girls) were opened both in Salisbury and Bulawayo, which provide an education fully equal to the best secondary schools in England. The number of pupils enrolled has far exceeded expectations.

Owing to the munificent bequests of the late Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Beit, largely increased educational facilities are now afforded. Scholarships and Bursaries are granted to pupils in the country, and, in addition, there are nine "Rhodes Scholarships" (three per annum) by which a Rhodesian can secure a three years' course at Oxford University.

Revenue and Expenditure (Southern Rhodesia).
