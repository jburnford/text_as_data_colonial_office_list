CEYLON.

Situation and Area.

Ceylon, the ancient Taprobane, is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the southern extremity of Hindustan, lying between 5° 55' and 9° 50' N. lat. and 79° 42' and 81° 53' E. long.; its extreme length from north to south, i.e., from Point Palmyra to Dondra Head, is 270 miles; its greatest width 140 miles, from Colombo on the west coast to Sangamankanda on the east. Its area is 25,332 square miles, or about equal to Holland and Belgium.

The Maldives Archipelago, 400 miles south-west of Ceylon, made up of 18 groups—known as atolls—or islets, but for centuries past arranged for administrative purposes in 13 groups, which are sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for nearly eight centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coconut palms and yield millet, fruit, and cocoon produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population enumerated at the census 1921 was 70,413, including 137 Indian Borahs, 22 Malabars, and 58 Ceylon Moors who were at Male Island for purposes of trade; the principal occupations are fishing (14,760 males), coir and lace making (10,799 females and 13 males), toddy drawing (1,273 males), carpentry (1,133 males), and cultivation (853 males and 572 females). Male, the residence of the Sultan and the capital of the Islands, is a little over 3 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate of Ceylon for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in India.

Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° F., and a noteworthy feature is the smallness of the variation both between day and night in the same twenty-four hours, and between the different parts of the year. At Kandy, 1,654 feet above sea level, the mean temperature is 76° F., and the rule of 1° F. drop in temperature for each 300 feet rise in altitude holds fairly well throughout the island.

At Colombo and Galle the mean monthly temperature in the coldest months (December and January) is less than four degrees below those in the warmest months (April and May), while the mean daily ranges for the year are 12-3° and 7-4° respectively.

At Trincomalee, on the other side of the island, conditions are only slightly more varied. The mean monthly temperature in May (86° F.) is seven degrees above that in December (79° F.), while the mean daily range for the year is 13-7° F.

It must be remembered, however, that the change in the capacity of the air for moisture for each degree of change of temperature in the Ceylon low country is far greater than the corresponding change per degree at the mean temperature of London.

The highest temperatures are experienced in the district to the north of the hills, and to the northeast, but it is only in a very few days in the year that a temperature of 100° Fahr. or over is experienced. Trincomalee holds the record with
103°-7° Fahr. In the hills there is of course a great variety of climate, and at Nuwara Eliya, over 6,000 feet above mean sea level, frost is occasionally recorded in the early part of the year.

The annual average rainfall varies from below 40 inches in the dry zones to the north-west and south-east of the Island to above 150 inches at certain places on the south-west slopes of the hills. The chief rainy seasons extend from April to June and from October to January, but as there is a sharp antithesis between the windward and lee side during both monsoons (particularly the S.W.), it is hard to summarise the island as a whole in one sentence. It may fairly be said that there is not a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.

History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the sixth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the north of India established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

In the sixteenth century the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1796 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1802, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1816 war was declared against the Sinhalese Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island came under the rule of the British.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The present constitution of these Councils was settled by the Ceylon (Legislative Council) Orders in Council 1923 and 1924, and by Letters Patent and Instructions issued in 1920. The Executive Council consists of four ex-officio members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Controller of Revenue, and the Colonial Treasurer, and five other members, of whom four are unofficial. The Legislative Council consists of 49 members, including five ex-officio members, viz., the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Controller of Revenue, and the Treasurer, seven nominated official and three nominated unofficial members, and 34 elected unofficial members.

Of the elected members, eleven represent special interests and communities, viz., the European Electorate (Urban), 1; the European Electorate (Rural), 1; the Commercial Electorate, 1; the Burgher Electorate, 2; the Indian Electorate, 2; the Muslim Electorate, 3; the Western Province (Ceylon Tamil) Electorate, 1; and 23 represent territorial constituencies.

The nine Provinces are presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

As a result of the recommendations of a Special Commission appointed in 1927, a new Constitution has been approved by the Secretary of State and the Legislative Council, and will probably be put into operation during 1931. The Legislative Council will be replaced by a State Council consisting of 50 members elected for territorial constituencies, 3 ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, Attorney General, and Treasurer) to be called Officers of State, and 8 members nominated by the Governor. The State Council will concern itself with administration as well as with legislation.

The Departments of Government, instead of being under the supervision of the Colonial Secretary, will be divided into ten groups. Three of these groups will be left in charge of the Colonial Secretary (now Chief Secretary), the Attorney General, and the Treasurer. The remaining seven groups will be in charge of Members of the State Council who are elected as Chairmen of the various Executive Committees, and who will be styled Ministers. The Ministers with the Officers of State will form the Board of Ministers.

All Ceylonese, both male and female, of a minimum age of 21, are included in the franchise. British subjects not domiciled in Ceylon will be allowed to qualify for the franchise in accordance with the hitherto existing Constitution, or on their furnishing satisfactory evidence of five years' residence and a declaration of permanent settlement in the Island.

Population, Area, and Statistics.

According to the decennial census taken in 1921 the population was 4,504,549 an increase of 9-6 per cent. on the population enumerated in 1911. The details of the population were as follows (including the military, shipping, estates, and miscellaneous):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 1,251,639  |
| Central ditto             | 717,739    |
| Southern ditto            | 671,368    |
| Northern ditto            | 375,462    |
| Eastern ditto             | 192,947    |
| North-Western Province    | 492,287    |
| North-Central ditto       | 96,525     |
| Province of Uva           | 234,027    |
| Provinces of Sabaragamuwa | 471,814    |
| Miscellaneous             | 751        |
| **Total**                 | **4,504,549** |

Among these were 8,937 Europeans, 29,532 Burghers and Eurasians, 3,016,659 Sinhalese, 1,121,018 Tamils, 285,876 Moors, 13,461 Malays, and 29,066 persons of other nationalities. The Buddhists (2,770,391) numbered more than half the population, there were 982,733 Hindus, 445,015 Christians (mostly Roman Catholic), 303,863 Muslims, and 2,547 other religionists. The population of the principal towns was as follows:—Colombo, 248,828; Negombo, 21,349; Moratuwa, 28,608; Kalutara, 13,596; Kandy, 32,562; Jaffna, 42,611; Galle, 39,157; Matare, 16,779; Batticaloa, 10,646; Trincomalee, 9,442; Kurunegala, 10,187; Badulla, 8,126.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea estates, etc., was about 500,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, was estimated at 569,000.

The entire area of the Colony is 25,332 square miles. About one quarter of this area, after deducting backwaters, etc., is under cultivation. Some 4,000 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,600 to

* By "Miscellaneous" are meant persons enumerated in trains and in the Great and Little Basins.
8,362 feet above sea level. The approximate acreages under the most important products are:

| Product          | Acres   |
|------------------|---------|
| Coconuts         | 1,100,000 |
| Rice             | 800,000  |
| Tea              | 457,000  |
| Grain (other than Rice) | 106,000 |
| Rubber           | 554,000  |
| Cinnamon         | 26,000   |
| Cacao            | 34,000   |
| Tobacco          | 14,000   |

At the end of 1929, the number of plumbago mines reported to be working was 74. The amount of plumbago exported during the year was 254,776 cwt., valued at Rs. 2,729,639.

The minimum upset price of Crown land is Rs. 16 to 20 per acre. 12,604 acres were granted and sold by the Revenue officers in 1929.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack and Toddy Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt for the financial year 1928-29 was Rs. 1,757,459. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed on an import duty of Rs. 4 per cwt.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy and Galle, by the Provincial and District Road Committees, by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement and Urban District Councils which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Panadure, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton-Dickoya, Matara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Bandarawela, Ratnapura, Kegalla, Moratuwa, and Jaffna, and by Village Committees amounted in 1929 to Rs. 14,854,618-44. The revenue collected by the Sanitary Boards amounted to Rs. 988,564-19.

The municipal debt outstanding on 31st Dec., 1929, was Rs. 13,692,190-94. Of this amount Rs. 9,989,982-84 is the balance of the loan borrowed from the Government for the Colombo Drainage Works, and Rs. 2,709,296-68 for Water Works. Rs. 318,931-74 is the balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle for the construction of waterworks, sanitary improvements and electric lighting, and Rs. 663,966-68 is the balance due from the municipality of Kandy for water-works, drainage, housing and electric lighting.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1900, 149,264,602 lbs.; 1929, 251,000,000 lbs.

There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. On the failure of coffee, planters preferred to substitute cinchona and tea. Cinchona however did not survive low prices and was replaced by tea. Within recent years great attention has been given to rubber. In 1898, 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber, in 1906, 100,000 acres, and in 1929 about 534,000 acres.

The value of the products of the coconut palm exported in 1929 was Rs. 64,278,097. During the past few years greater attention has been given to the cultivation of coconuts, and large areas of land formerly occupied with cinnamon are now planted in this crop. The value of cacao exported in 1929 was Rs. 4,236,136 and of cinnamon Rs. 3,784,440.

The chief imports are rice from India (including Burma), valued at Rs. 92,276,333, and from other countries valued at Rs. 7,177,230 in 1929, and coal and textiles chiefly from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. Kandyan law and Muslim law also prevail among Kandyans and Muslims respectively. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively has been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court, which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; by the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of minor criminal and civil suits; and by the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases. In addition to these there are the Gazabawas, Village Councils, and Village Tribunals, instituted under the Ordinance No. 24 of 1889, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked well and are thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people. Besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, they have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1929 was 212,417, in assisted schools 317,752, and in unaided schools 26,359.

The total expenditure on account of the Education Department in 1928-29 was Rs. 11,198,142-68. In 1888, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure Rs. 161,660. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Education and the adoption of a system under which the educational wants of the Island are met partly by Government, partly by schools receiving grants in aid from Government. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; fees are charged for English teaching.

The only Secondary School entirely supported by Government is the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-aid Secondary Schools. Seven Government scholarships, each of £300. per annum, five for two years and two for three years, with outfit allowances of Rs. 750 each and free passages, are awarded annually, on the results of the B.A. and B.Sc. Examinations of the University of London, to enable the best seven students of the year to complete their education at English universities.

Industrial education is provided in 70 Government and Grant-in-aid Schools and in a number of Orphanages. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893; its title has since been changed to "Government Technical Schools."

A University College opened in Colombo in 1921, offers instruction in the following subjects:—English Language and Literature, Classics and Philosophy, Modern History and Economics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Sanskrit and Pali, Tamil, Sinhalese.
Modern Languages, Botany, Zoology, Geography. Students are presented for the External Examinations, Pass and Honours, of the University of London.

A Government Training College for Masters and Mistresses in English Schools and Government Vernacular Schools was opened in 1903.

Medical Institutions.

Medical College.—The Ceylon Medical College was founded in 1870 to provide a course of Medical training for the Ceylonese. The curriculum is a full five years' course, and since 1887 the Licence of the College has been recognised by the General Medical Council as a registrable Colonial qualification. The courses of instruction and examinations are also recognised by many of the British Examining Boards. The licence has been conferred upon 486 candidates since the College was opened; of recent years about 18 qualify annually.

There is a Junior or Apothecary Department in which students go through a two years' course, and after passing the prescribed examinations are qualified to serve as Apothecaries and Estate Dispensers.

The College has a staff of over 30 lecturers and is managed by a Council incorporated by law.

There are at present about 200 students.

Owing to changes introduced by the Medical Council of Great Britain, the preliminary subjects, Physics, Chemistry and Biology, are now pre-medical subjects, and arrangements have been made for these to be studied at the University College. Students must pass an examination in these subjects before they can be admitted to the Medical College for their purely medical studies.

The Medical College fees amounted to rs. 52,643-50 in 1929-30.

There are 89 Government general hospitals, providing nearly 7,000 beds, with varying accommodation from 8 beds in smaller outstations to 869 beds in the General Hospital, Colombo.

There are in addition a number of special hospitals, viz., a lying-in-home with 100 beds, an eye hospital (with 68 beds) with an ear, nose and throat clinic attached, a women's hospital with 45 beds, a children's hospital with 82 beds, a women's venereal hospital with 29 beds, a police hospital with 31 beds, a tuberculosis hospital for chronic cases with 349 beds, a tuberculosis sanatorium with 72 beds, an infectious disease hospital with 168 beds, a lunatic asylum and House of Observation with 1,830 beds, a prison hospital, Colombo, with 192 beds, and 8 other prison hospitals providing 149 beds, two leper asylums, one with 508 beds at Handala (near Colombo), and the other with 176 beds at Mantivu, Eastern Province.

Eighty-five estate hospitals and 706 estate dispensaries are maintained by proprietors of estates.

There were 601 Government dispensaries in different parts of the Island in 1929, and 3,626,606 patients who paid 5,407,588 visits were treated at these dispensaries.

There are a bacteriological, a pasteur, a dental, and an anti-tuberculosis Institute, and a vaccine establishment. A division of sanitary engineering and a division of health education are recent developments. Campaigns are carried on against malaria, ankylostomiasis and parangi. Estate sanitation is looked after by six inspecting medical officers. Five health units have been established since 1926 and health work on intensive lines is carried on at those centres. School hygiene work is carried out throughout the Island by five school medical officers.

In the Department of Medical and Sanitary Services are 330 medical officers, of whom 204 possess British qualifications, 28 medical officers of health, 383 apothecaries, and 253 sanitary inspectors. There are three institutions where nurses are trained. The nursing staff of the Department consists of 41 European qualified matrons and sisters, 101 European Roman Catholic mothers and sisters, 378 matrons and nurses trained locally, and pupils in training.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1928-29 to rs. 10,216,467-18. The receipts, which included the cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, etc., amounted to rs. 828,361-33 for 1928-29. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 1,485,422-63 for 1928-29. The export duty levied for the purpose of meeting the expense of providing Medical aid to estates under the Medical Wants Ordinance No. 9 of 1912 amounted to rs. 1,639,170-69 for 1928-29.

Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency, sovereigns having ceased to be legal tender in the Colony in 1920. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pice. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 31st December, 1929, was rs. 57,292,493. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Imperial Bank of India; National Bank of India, Limited; Eastern Bank, Limited; P. & O. Banking Corporation, Ltd. None of these issues notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885. On 31st December, 1929, the deposits were: Ceylon Savings Bank, rs. 7,590,590; Post Office Savings Bank, rs. 13,040,837.

The Colombo Harbour.

A body designated the Colombo Port Commission was established in 1913, to administer the affairs of the Port of Colombo. The Commission is responsible for the efficient working of the Port, and has powers of executive action and initiative. It is composed of seven official members, seven unofficial members, and a secretary. The official members are the Principal Collector of Customs (Chairman), the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the General Manager of the Railway, the Chairman, Municipal Council, and Mayor of Colombo, the Deputy Collector of Customs, Colombo, the Master Attendant, Colombo and Galle, and the Harbour Engineer. Six of the unofficial members are nominated by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, and the seventh (representative of the Ceylonese and Indian interests of the Port) by the Governor.

The Harbour Works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, commenced in 1873, and completed in 1885, at a cost of 706,207l., is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction North by East. It is built of concrete blocks weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.

The North-East and North-West breakwaters were begun in 1894, and completed in 1906, at a total cost of 581,857l. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging. The North-West breakwater is an island work, 2,670 feet in length, running between the two shore
breakwaters, leaving a western entrance of 750 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 643 acres, or one square mile.

An extension of the S.W. breakwater, starting from a point 3,160 feet from the shore end, was commenced in December, 1907, and completed in April, 1912. The arm is 1,800 feet long, and runs in a direction almost due north, protecting the present main entrance from the S.W. Monsoon seas. The cost of this additional arm was 338,931l.

The Graving Dock. A Graving Dock was commenced in 1899, and was completed in 1906. It is 723 feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost was 433,523l. There is also a guide pier, 800 feet long, to assist vessels entering the dock. The dock has its own electric light installation. The docking of ships can be carried out by day or night.

The Patent Ship was commenced in 1899, and opened in 1903, the cost being 46,266l. It is 800 feet long, the paddle being 220 feet, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

Oil Facilities. The Oil Installations Depot, which is about 92 acres in extent, lies 3½ miles inland from the harbour front. The Oil Companies' storage tanks are situated within this area, with pipe line connection from the harbour for fuel oil, kerosene, and benzine imported in bulk. There is also a Measuring Tanks Depot (about 19 acres in extent) at Bloemondahl, about three-quarters of a mile from the Harbour. Three reinforced concrete jetties, two for bunkering purposes and one for the discharge of oil tankers, have been provided. The Outer Bunkering Jetty can accommodate vessels of 500 feet in length with a draught of 27 feet; the Inner Bunkering Jetty is available for barges. The Discharge Jetty can accommodate vessels 600 feet in length with a draught of 27 feet. The expenditure on the oil scheme up to 30th September, 1929, was rs. 5,253,646.

The Coal Depot consists of 25 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 17 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, stacking, and shipping of coal. The total cost of this depot was 64,746l.

The total cost of the Reclamation and Jetties amounts to 174,698l.

The Fishery Harbour is to the northward of Colombo harbour for the use of the fishermen as a beaching ground. The fishery harbour consists of a rubble breakwater running out from the shore in a curve for 800 feet, the sheltered part forming a natural beaching ground for fishing canoes. The cost was 11,507l.

The total expenditure on the Colombo harbour from 1873, when work in connection with the first breakwater was commenced, to 1913, when the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the harbour, was rs. 44,790,267, or 2,986,018l., taking the value of the rupee at Is. 4d.

In the period 1913 to 1929 a sum of rs. 36,160,736 or 2,410,718l., has been spent on various development and maintenance works by the Colombo Port Commission, and a sum of rs. 2,586,373 or 172,425l. by the Public Works Department, making a total of rs. 38,747,109 or 2,583,141l. In addition to the above expenditure a sum of rs. 660,052 or 44,004l. was charged to Loan Funds during the period 1922-1926, in connection with the dredging of the Colombo Harbour (including rock excavation). Prior to 1st October, 1922, this expenditure was met from Revenue, and is included in the sum of rs. 38,747,109 or 2,583,141l. mentioned above.

Since the Colombo Port Commission assumed control of the Port, many improvements have been carried out, and shore facilities much increased. The warehouse accommodation in 1913 was 291,600 sq. ft., and this has been increased to 592,476 sq. ft.; similarly the quayage for lighters has been increased from 4,845 lineal ft. to 14,043 lineal feet, including 1,278 lineal feet at the Lake to Harbour Canal Quay.

Dredging for deepening the harbour has been steadily carried out, and, of the 643 acres low water area of the harbour, 186 acres are now dredged to 36 feet and over, 102 acres to between 36 and 33 feet, 147 acres to between 33 and 30 feet, and 208 acres have a depth of less than 30 feet; berthing accommodation exclusive of the Graving Dock Guide Pier and Oil Jetties being available for 36 vessels in the north-east monsoon and for 23, or, if packed berths are used, 40, vessels in the south-west monsoon, six of which berths in either monsoon are available for vessels of draughts up to 33 feet.

A scheme for the development of the Colombo Lake and its connection to the Harbour was completed in 1925 at a total cost of rs. 9,206,490. The total capital expenditure on the Lake Scheme up to September, 1929, is rs. 10,048,032. The connection to the Harbour was taken over by the Colombo Port Commission in November, 1922, and the areas on both sides developed for the landing of import cargoes.

The maintenance of the waterways and quay walls of the Colombo Lake up to and including the operation of the San Sebastian Canal Locks and pumping plant has now been taken over, and it is hoped that this will lead to further development of its resources.

Colombo Water Supply.

The Colombo Water supply is obtained from Labugama Reservoir which is situated in the Western Province, at a distance of 28½ miles from the City.

The Reservoir was formed by impounding the water of the Wak-Oya, a tributary of the Kelani Ganga.

The Catchment area, which is 2,800 acres in extent, is free from any habitation or cultivation, all the land to the summit of the water shed having been reserved together with a strip two chains in depth along the adjacent water sheds.

The area of the reservoir at present top water level is 205 acres. This lake, the scenery of which is very charming, is 370 feet above sea level and has a maximum depth of 70 feet.

The storage capacity of the reservoir is 1,900 million gallons.

Filtration works of the "Jewell Gravity" type are situated immediately below the Reservoir Dam.

The water has a very low alkalinity and is remarkably pure. It is conveyed to the two service Reservoirs in Colombo through three separate pipe lines; two of these are of cast iron each 20 inches in diameter, and the other of steel 30 inches in diameter.

There are some 250 miles of supply and distribution mains, varying in size from 30 to 3 inches in diameter. Water service is available to all premises within the City and also to shipping in Colombo Harbour.

The average daily consumption is 11 million gallons, or 36 gallons per head of population.

Railways.

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus—

Broad Gauge (5ft. 6 in.), Colombo to Badulla (181½ miles), Polgahawela to Kankesanturai (212½ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21½ miles), Ragama Junction to Mahara Quarry (1¾ miles), Colombo to Matara (98½ miles), Ragama to Puttalam (7¼ miles), Maho to Batticaloa (132 miles), Galoya Junction to Trincomalee (43½ miles), Madawachi to Talaimannar Pier (68 miles), Kolonnawa Oil Line and Harbour Branch (3½ miles).
Narrow Gauge (2 ft. 6 in.), Colombo Fort to Yatiyantota (49½ miles), Avissawella to Opanaike (48½ miles), Nanu Oya to Ragalla (19½ miles). Total Mileage 951 miles. The total cost of construction up to 30th September, 1929, charged in account was Rs. 217,674,271. The receipts for the 12 months ended 30th September, 1929, were Rs. 32,498,947, and expenditure Rs. 25,996,899.

By the completion of the Talaimannar extension the railway systems of India and Ceylon were brought within 20 miles of one another, the intervening distance being covered by steamers of the South Indian Railway Co., which ply between Dhamsakodi (the Indian Port) and Talaimannar (the Ceylon Port). The other extensions are for the better transport of planting produce (tea, rubber, coconuts, etc.).

Roads.

Of metalled roads there are 4,064 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 511 and 132 miles respectively. The maintenance of 4,707 miles of road cost, in 1929, Rs. 7,799,280 or an average rate of Rs. 1,657 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works.

The mileage of telephone wire in the Government system at the end of August, 1930, was estimated at 11,502* (aerial) and 30,480 (underground).

Telegraphs.

Nearly all parts of the island are served by the Government telegraph system, which has 297 offices working, inclusive of Railway offices open for postal telegrams. The system comprises 3,388 miles of line and 8,736† miles of wire. Ceylon is in direct telegraphic communication with India by a cable which starts from Talaimannar and crosses the Pamban Channel. It is also connected with Europe by direct cables from Colombo to Aden and with the Far East and Australia by direct cables to Penang.

There is a Government Radio Station in Colombo equipped for Continuous Wave and Interrupted Continuous Wave telegraphic services, and also for telephony.

The Continuous Wave service is conducted on a wave length of 2,300 metres with a normal daylight range of 1,000 miles.

The Interrupted Continuous Wave Service is conducted on the 600 metre wave length, and has a normal daylight range of 500 miles.

The telephonic equipment is for providing a broadcasting service on a wavelength of 428·5 metres. The rating of the set for telephony is 2 kilowatt. The number of licence holders at the end of August, 1930, was 1,412.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. Famagusta, with a harbour able to accommodate vessels up to 23 ft. draught, is 295 miles from Egypt, while the port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

Its area is 3,684 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Messoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce (or Stavrovouni), about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the garrison, of the Governor, and some of the principal officials.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History and Archaeology.

The history of Cyprus is too long and eventful to be related here except in the briefest outline. Excavations have shewn that in the second millennium B.C. the island must have been an important centre of Aegean civilization, having intercourse both with Assyria and with Egypt, and at a very early date important Greek and Phoenician colonies were established in it. In the 6th century B.C. it passed under the rule of Egypt, but in 525 B.C. it joined Cambyses in his war against the Egyptians and so was absorbed in the Persian Empire. The whole island, with the exception of the Phrygian town of Amathos, took part in the Ionio revolt in 502 B.C., but the Persians recovered possession in about a year and at the battle of Salamis the fleet of Xerxes included 150 Cypriote ships. At the end of the 5th century the famous Evagoras of Salamis established his supremacy over the whole island and raised it for a brief period to a position of practical independence, but after his death it again came under the control of Persia. After the battle of the Issus, Cyprus hastened to join Alexander the Great and sent 120 ships to assist him in the siege of Tyre. At the division of Alexander's Empire, the possession of Cyprus was disputed by Syria and Egypt, but it eventually passed to the latter. In 58 B.C. it became a Roman province and was for a time joined to Cilicia, during which period it was administered by Ciosero. Presented by Antonius to Cleopatra, it reverted to Rome on her death, and remained a Roman province until the division of the Empire,
when it was assigned to the Eastern Emperor. Its proximity to Syria exposed it to the assaults of the Saracens, and it changed hands more than once between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. It was finally recovered for Byzantium by Nicephorus Phocas in 965, and remained attached to the Eastern Empire until 1184. In that year its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. Isaac maintained his independence until 1191, when Cyprus was conquered by Richard I. of England in revenge for the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. Richard sold the island first to the Order of the Temple and later, when the Templars found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, but during that period the Genoese Republic exercised a suzerainty over part of the kingdom, from 1373 until 1464, by holding possessions of the principal port of Famagusta. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island, and retained possession of it until its cession to England in 1878 for administrative purposes. On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923 Turkey recognised the annexation.

On the 1st of May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally elevated to the status of a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Historical Monuments and Museums.

Bronze Age, Phenician, Hellenic, and Roman antiquities have been found in immense quantities all over Cyprus from time immemorial, and scientific explorations on a large scale were conducted during the latter part of the last century, and even still an occasional treasure trove of importance may be found. But it is more the ambition of the present administration of antiquities to place the numerous classic sites and monuments in a condition rendering them accessible and of greater interest to the visitor than has hitherto been attempted. Paphos, Salamis, Idalion, and many other places demand attention in order to preserve their ancient character, now threatened by the island becoming once more a centre of revived life and activity. Salamis possesses the remains of probably the largest entrepot (Forum) ever built by the Romans, foreshadowing perhaps the famous "Emporium of the East" as Famagusta was called in the middle ages. A Roman temple of the largest size at Nea-Paphos lies in ruins which have never been explored (vide Hogarth's "Devis Cypris," 1899).

The Museum (architect, G. Jeffery, O.B.E., F.S.A., Cur. Ano. Monts.), Nicosia, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria and much added to in recent years, contains a very magnificent collection of Cypriot pottery, stone carving, gold and metal works of art. Separate smaller collections of the mediæval architectural fragments, which are always coming to light, have been formed as Musées Lapidaire in the principal towns.

The superb Gothio cathedrals and churches of Nicosia and Famagusta, in their curious Eastern surroundings, attract numerous visitors. These buildings, of the finest type of French mediæval art, are singularly well preserved where they have been converted into mosques; in other cases they are interesting ruins.

The Venetian and Genoese Republics left few traces of their rule in the island beyond the imposing fortifications of the seaports of Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Limassol, all of which are scheduled as Ancient Monuments.

The number of Ancient Monuments in Cyprus now protected by the Antiquities Law of 1905 amounts to 55.

Climate.

The mean temperature, as recorded in the screen at Nicosia, for the last fifteen years is 66°4° Fahr.; mean maximum, 78°0°; mean minimum, 64°8°. Highest shade temperature during that time 110°; lowest 26°. Average rainfall for last ten years, 20'67 inches. The year 1929 had a rainfall of 26'67 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole Island. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. Malarial fevers are prevalent during the hot months, and, if the winter is mild, they occur throughout the year. Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees have, however, had a beneficial effect.

Population.

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the census taken in 1901, 1911, and 1921, was:

| District   | 1901    | 1911    | 1921    |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Nicosia    | 71,289  | 81,497  | 93,785  |
| Famagusta  | 48,508  | 58,630  | 63,755  |
| Larnaca    | 26,073  | 29,737  | 34,918  |
| Limassol   | 39,139  | 46,084  | 54,332  |
| Paphos     | 35,205  | 38,508  | 42,330  |
| Kyrenia    | 16,808  | 19,752  | 21,615  |

Total       | 237,022 | 274,108 | 310,715 |

The Moslems, who are all Ottoman Turks, form about 19'74 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Independent Cypriote Church.

The Cypriote Church is a branch of and in communion with the Orthodox Eastern Church, but is "autocephalous" (i.e., The Archbishop of Cyprus is not subordinate to any Patriarch). This position of independence it has retained undisturbed since the 6th century when the Emperor Zeno finally decided against the claims of the Patriarch of Antioch to exercise authority over it.

Christianity was originally introduced into the island by St. Paul and St. Barnabas, the latter of whom, a Cypriote Jew by birth, was martyred at Salamis.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 18,679 inhabitants; Larnaca, 9,765; Limassol, 13,302. The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour. The inner harbour is dredged over an area of 900 feet by 600 feet, to 24 feet at low water (ordinary spring tides), with a channel of approach 250 feet wide and 26 feet deep. The curtain wall, south of Othello's Tower, has been pierced with three arches, giving access from the town to the new quay. The quay is faced with a concrete wall 900 feet long in 24 feet of water. Further accommodation for sailing vessels and local craft has been provided in a basin 450 feet long.
200 feet wide, and 15 feet deep at low water. At present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has 1,887 inhabitants, nearly all Moslems, but it is now being rebuilt and opened out. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 5,093, nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktema, 4,117, the modern capital of Paphos, on the southwest, and Kyrenia, 1,910, where a small harbour has been constructed, in the district of the same name on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania. A harbour for small coasting vessels exists at Paphos, the site of the ancient capital of that district. This had become silted up and almost useless, but it has recently been dredged sufficiently to enable small sailing vessels to enter and lie in safety.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its copper mines, and an American syndicate is now operating on a considerable scale in the Evrychou Valley with a crushing plant at Morphou Bay, where steamers call and load the ore. Gypsum is exported in the form of plaster-of-paris from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these ports it is sent monthly to Egypt, smaller quantities going to Turkey and Syria. Asbestos is found on Mount Troodos, and it is mined by the Cyprus Asbestos Company, Limited, and a local syndicate. The Company has recently established an asbestos brick and tile making plant, and a subsidiary Company a large steam bakery both at Amiandos. Terra Umbra is burnt in large quantities in Larnaca and exported to Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States of America, in both a raw and burnt condition. Chrome is being mined by two companies. A modern tannery has been built at Larnaca, which now supplies most of the leather required for the Island. It imports buffalo and other hides to augment the local supplies. It is an up-to-date establishment, and is now working up an important export trade in tanned skins, especially for the glove trade. A factory for the preparation of sumach has also been established at Limassol. The development of the silk industry has received great assistance by the establishment of a Silk Filature at Yeroskipos, in Paphos.

The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carobs, wine, spirits and vinegar, tobacco and cigarettes, linseed, flax, aniseed, cumin seed, sumach, silk, silk cocoons, wool, straw, hides and skins, cotton, cotton seed, cheese, potatoes, onions, raisins, grapes, oranges, lemons, mandarines, pomegranates, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, almonds, and hazel nuts; cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, poultry and eggs are also exported.

Agriculture is dependent largely on irrigation, the water for which is obtained mainly from wells in the dry season and by flooding from streams during the rainy season. There are two streams which have their source in hill ranges which are tapped by driven into the hills, one at Lapithos and the other at Kythrea. Agriculture has been greatly retarded by the deficient rainfall and the lack of water for irrigation. Boring trials have, however, revealed the presence of artesian water and irrigation schemes are now contemplated, which it is hoped will contribute to the development of agriculture generally and to fruit production in particular.

Considerable attention has been given in the last year or two to tobacco, and the Government has provided itinerant Tobacco Experts to afford instruction to the peasant growers. These efforts are bearing results, and last year's crop was considerable improvement on that of previous years. Special efforts are also being made in London to facilitate the marketing of tobacco and cigarettes in the United Kingdom. Similar efforts are being made in regard to flax, the cultivation of which is extending.

Cyprus wine, which has been famous from early times, has lately received a good deal of attention. It was formerly a domestic industry, and the wines produced consequently lacked uniformity in character and quality. Modern methods of manufacture have now been introduced and good light table wines are now on the market. An effort is also being made to market Cyprus wines in the United Kingdom, and a Law has been enacted to prohibit the export to British Possessions of wines not coming up to the standards required. This, it is hoped, will secure recognition of the good wines produced in Cyprus and prevent the export of inferior wines, prejudicial to the marketing of the best Cyprus wines.

The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government by means of Nursery Gardens in suitable centres for the distribution of seeds and plants, by experimental and demonstration plots in village centres or along roadsides, by School Gardens, by itinerant agricultural experts, agricultural shows, etc. The Department of Agriculture has been recently reorganised, and it is hoped in the near future to establish a Central Experiment Farm, a Citrus Experiment Station, and an Experimental Vineyard.

The Agricultural Department has an Agricultural College where courses of agricultural instruction are given to the students, pupils of the Nicosia Training School, schoolmasters, etc. The building of an up-to-date college on the Central Experiment Farm above referred to is contemplated. Young Cypriots are sent from time to time to England for special training as agriculturists, entomologists, etc.

Considerable attention is given by the Government to cattle breeding. Cyprus is famous for its donkeys and mules. The Government maintains a stock farm at Athalassa and stud stables throughout the Island. Good breeds of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats are imported for the improvement of the local breeds. Good breeds of poultry are maintained by the Government for distribution. The export of poultry and eggs is increasing yearly, and there is considerable room for expansion.

The establishment of a weekly mail service with Egypt has led to an increased production of crops, particularly fruit and vegetables. Egypt is in fact the principal market for Cyprus produce; over a quarter of its exports go to Egypt, including a considerable export of oxen, sheep, and mules.

In past years much injury has been done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug
at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts became more scattered, was discarded in favour of a system of collecting locust eggs and purchasing live locusts. Both the purchase and the spraying systems have been employed in recent years.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the depredations of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a large number, and partly in consequence of the forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing is carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek Islands. Sponge fishers are issued a licence at a nominal fee and the Government takes a duty in kind of 20% in the case of harpoon boats and 25% in the case of machine boats of the catch.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, fertilisers, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, silk cocoons, linseed, aniseed, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, asbestos, gypsum, iron pyrites, chrome and terra umbra.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1901, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign. Silver, 18, 9, 4½, 3 piastre pieces, limit of tender 540 piastres (nine equal to one shilling). Bronze, 1 piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras = 1 piastre). By proclamation of 28th April, 1928, a new silver 45-piastre piece is current and legal tender in the colony as from that date. Currency Notes were issued from time to time from September, 1914, as a war measure. Notes of the following denominations are in circulation:—£5, £1. By an Order-in-Council of 1st November, 1928 the Treasurer as "Commissioner" of Currency was authorised to issue Currency Notes of the Government; such Notes are to be legal tender, and provision was made for the conversion of the Notes into sterling and vice versa, and for the establishment of a Note Security Fund.

The Ottoman Bank has branches at Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, also at Troödos during summer season.

The Bank of Athens has branches at Limassol and Nicosia, with Correspondents at Larnaca, Famagusta and Paphos.

The Ionian Bank has a branch at Nicosia, agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos, and Correspondents at Kyrenia and Morphou.

The Bank of Cyprus, has its Head Office at Nicosia, agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos, Kyrenia and Morphou.

The Agricultural Bank of Cyprus Limited, which operates under a Government Guarantee, was established in 1925, with head offices at Nicosia. It lends money to farmers through the medium of Co-operative Credit Societies or direct to individuals.

Other banks operating in Cyprus are Bank of Larnaca, Limited and Emniel Bank, Limited with Head Offices at Larnaca; Peoples Bank, Limassol, Limited, with Head Office at Limassol; Famagusta Bank, Limited, with Head Office at Famagusta; Popular Bank of Paphos, Limited, and Melissa Bank, Limited, with Head Offices at Paphos.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke=2½lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum=about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

The Government Railway from Famagusta Harbour to Nicosia (37 miles) came into use in August, 1905, was extended to Morphou (24 miles), in 1907, and to Evrychou, in the direction of Troödos (15 miles), in 1915.

There is no navigable waterway in the island. Roads between all important places are maintained, and many villages are now connected with them by cart roads. There are motor car services between Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos, and Kyrenia, the chief towns of each district. The Famagusta harbour was completed in June, 1906. An extension of the pier at Larnaca, with a solid sheltering arm at the sea end, giving protection to small boats and lighters in all weathers, was completed in 1909. The ancient harbour at Paphos has recently been dredged to a sufficient depth to admit of its use by the small coasting craft that trade between Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor and Cyprus, and the area available for such craft increased in the Kyrenia Harbour. Proposals for the improvement of the harbours at Larnaca, Famagusta and Kyrenia are under consideration. There are no Government telegraphs, other than those along the railway, but the Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, maintain a cable from Egypt to Cyprus and land lines connecting the six principal towns of the Island and the Troödos Government Quarters. A weekly Mail Service is maintained between Egypt, Cyprus, Syria and Cilicia by subsidized steamers of the Khedivial SS. Co. Steamers of the Lloyd Triestino Company, of Trieste, call fortnightly from Egypt via Palestine, Syria and Mersina en route for Greece and Italy, and another line of the same Company fortnightly from Italy and Greece en route for Mersina, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Greece and Italy. Steamers of the Messageries Maritimes call fortnightly from France via Italy, Greece and Turkey en route for Syria, Palestine, Egypt and France. Steamers of the Sitmar Line call fortnightly from Italy via Egypt, Palestine and Syria en route for Turkey, Greece, Italy and France.

Money Orders and British Postal Orders are also issued and paid in the Colony. "Cash on Delivery" parcels for delivery within the Colony are accepted and delivered at the principal post offices. A reciprocal service of "Cash on Delivery" of parcels has been established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom, Egypt and the Sudan.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882, and was further regulated by a Law passed in 1929.

There is a Board of Education for each religious community in the Island, i.e., the Greek Christian, the largest, the Moslem, next in size, and Armenian, Latin, Maronite and Jews which are quite small. Teachers' salaries, gratuities and other grants are now paid by Government, but the maintenance of the Schools is met from local taxation.

The following are the schools and enrolments of each community according to the latest statistics:—

Greek Christian.—696 schools, 23,632 boys, 15,276 girls, annual expenditure 82,984l.

Moslem.—261 schools, 5,343 boys, 3,608 girls, annual expenditure 20,221l.

Other communities.—19 schools, 804 scholars, annual expenditure 3,284l.

Secondary Schools.

There is a Moslem "İdadı" school in Nicosia which is supported entirely by the Government and the Evqaf as an inheritance from the previous Administration.

A Greek-Christian gymnasium in Nicosia, Limassol, Paphos, and Varosha, and a commercial lyceum at Larnaca, and a high school at Kyrenia, are managed by elective committees under the Secondary Education Law, 1929, but are supported mainly by entrance fees, without State aid. There is also a Seminary school at Larnaca, under the control of the Holy Synod of Cyprus, of which the Archbishop is President, with an enrolment of 101 pupils.

The "English School," conducted by English masters on the lines of an English grammar school, prepares boys who are going to England for their education and also for commerce. It has 200 pupils, chiefly sons of Government officials of all nationalities, and is supported by school fees. The American Academy at Larnaca is supported by the Reformed Presbyterian Mission, with an enrolment of 210 pupils.

There is also an American Academy for girls at Nicosia with 102 pupils and a Private Girls' School at Limassol with 130 pupils, supported chiefly by school fees.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantine, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:—

"I. That a Musulman religious Tribunal (Makhêmë-i-Shérifiye) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Musulman population of the island.

"II. That a Musulman resident in the island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evqaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Musulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands* let or sold during that period.

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazi Mirîé ve Emlaki Houmayayun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

>V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

>VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

The Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914, annexing the island contains the following provisions:—

"From and after the date hereof the said Island shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's Dominions and the said Island is annexed accordingly.

"Nothing in this Order shall affect the validity of any Instructions issued by His Majesty under the Royal Sign' Manual and Signet to the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of Cyprus, or of any Order in Council affecting Cyprus, or of any Law or Proclamation passed or issued under any such Instructions or Order, or of any act or thing

*The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of 5,000l. a year. (Agreement of the 3rd February, 1879.)
done under any such Instructions, Order, Law or Proclamation, save in so far as any provision of any such Order in Council, Law or Proclamation may be repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament which may, by reason of the annexation hereby declared, become extended to Cyprus, or to any Order or Regulation made under the authority of any such Act or having in Cyprus the force and effect of any such Act."

Government.

Letters Patent, bearing date 10th March, 1925, are the instrument now regulating the government of the Colony. The Government is administered by a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Legislature consists of the Governor, who is usually to preside, nine official Members and fifteen elected Members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and twelve by the non-Mohammedan voters. Only British subjects over 25 years of age are eligible for election. Every male person, being a British subject, or having resided in the Colony not less than five years, who has attained the age of 21 years and has paid any class of the taxes called Verghi, may exercise the franchise. The Council may be prorogued or dissolved by the Governor whenever he thinks fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for administrative purposes, is divided into six districts namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Paphos. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

For judicial purposes it is divided into three judicial districts, namely the administrative districts of (1) Nicosia and Kyrenia, of (2) Famagusta and Larnaca, and of (3) Limassol and Paphos.

The Courts established by the Cyprus Courts of Justice Order, 1882 (as amended) and superseding those in existence at the time of the occupation, were reconstituted by an Order in Council which came into force on 1st October, 1927, and provides for:

(1) A Supreme Court, consisting of five judges, two of whom are Christian and Moslem Cypriots respectively, and having power to hear criminal and civil appeals from the decisions of all other courts, including divisional courts of the Supreme Court.

(2) Three Divisional Courts consisting of one or two judges of the Supreme Court, as may be directed by the Chief Justice, and exercising the original jurisdiction conferred upon the Supreme Court to hear and determine (a) defended actions over £300 and (b) election petitions.

(3) Three District Courts, the personnel of each consisting of a President and four Cypriot Judges, two Christians and two Moslems, but when functioning constituted by the President and one or two Judges of differing religions, and having appellate civil jurisdiction in appeals from Assistant District Judges and original civil jurisdiction in all actions except those within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Musulman Religious Tribunal or triable by a Divisional Court, as stated in 2(a) supra. In bankruptcy, petitions for winding up companies, probate and in actions in respect of injury to property their jurisdiction is unlimited.

(4) Assistant District Judges' Courts of which there are at present nine. The Courts are held by an Assistant District Judge, and the President and the District Judges have also jurisdiction. These Courts have civil jurisdiction up to £5l. and exceptionally, up to £6l.

(5) Three Assize Courts having unlimited criminal jurisdiction and consisting of three or five judges, as may be directed by the Chief Justice, these being in the former case a non-Cypriot Judge of the Supreme Court and either two Judges or the President and one Judge of the District Court, and in the latter two non-Cypriot Judges of the Supreme Court and the President and two Judges of the District Court.

(6) (I) Magisterial Courts, consisting of the President and one or two District Judges of differing religions, having summary jurisdiction in cases involving up to three years' imprisonment or 100l. fine or both, and with or without an order for compensation not exceeding 100l.

(II) Magisterial Courts, consisting of the President sitting alone or of two District Judges of differing religions sitting together, having summary jurisdiction up to twelve months' imprisonment or 50l. fine or both, and with or without an order for compensation not exceeding 50l.

(III) Magisterial Courts, consisting of a District Judge sitting alone, and having summary jurisdiction up to three months' imprisonment or 10l. fine or both, and with or without an order for compensation not exceeding 10l.

(IV) Magisterial Courts, consisting of an Assistant District Judge, and having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment or 5l. fine or both, and with or without an order for compensation not exceeding 2l.

(7) Three Mussulman Religious Tribunals, consisting of a Sheri Judge, and having jurisdiction restricted to marriage, divorce, maintenance in relation thereto, inheritance and succession, wills and their registration, and the registration of vakifehs, and concerning persons of the Musulman faith only.

There is also a Sheri Tribunal of Appeal, consisting of the Moslem Judge of the Supreme Court as ex-officio President and any two Moslem District Judges nominated by the Chief Justice, and having jurisdiction to hear appeals from the decisions of Musulman Religious Tribunals.

The above statements apply to jurisdiction over both Cypriots and non-Cypriots, the distinction created by the Order in Council of 1882 having been abolished by that of 1927.

There is a police force of 914 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems, including the rank and file detailed for duty as prison warders.

Finances.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Kimat, a tax of 2 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands, houses, and other immovable property.
2. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.
3. An excise on tobacco.
4. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.
5. Salt monopoly.
6. Import duties.
7. Shipping and Wharfage dues.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished.
Grants in aid have been received from the British Government annually since 1897. From 1911-12 the grant was fixed at £50,000 a year, and since 1928, it has been increased to the fixed rate of £92,800 a year. A contribution of £10,000 a year has from the latter date, been made by the Colony towards the cost of Imperial Defence.
