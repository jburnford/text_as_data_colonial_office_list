JOHORE.

His Highness Sir Ibrahim, G.C.M.G., K.B.E., etc., etc., Sultan and Sovereign Ruler of the State and Territories of Johore.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,670 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and Johore; and the Johore river which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bahru, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Penggaram in Batu Pahat.

The climate approximates to that of Singapore and the Federated Malay States, the highest maximum and lowest minimum temperature in 1929 being 96° and 65° respectively.

A recent estimate places the total population at 338,392; at the last census in 1921, the Malay inhabitants were found to constitute 86 per cent. of the total, and the population of Johore Bahru Town was returned as 15,312.

In area, Johore approximates to Wales; in population to Cyprus; though the area, revenue, and trade of Johore are twice, thrice, and seven times respectively that of Cyprus.

History.

Of Johore history little is known prior to the advent of the Portuguese; moreover, the authorities differ regarding even such major points as the probable cradle of the Malay race. The "Semang" (Negrito aborigines) and "Sakai" (Indo-Chinese immigrants) who may have attained some degree of civilization, have been driven to the hills; a number of semi-wild "proto-Malay" tribes exist chiefly along the coasts; while the regular occupants of the country are the descendants of the Malays who brought their civilization from Palembang in Sumatra about the 13th century.

Prior to that, the country though unoccupied was much visited: the Dravidians of South India are responsible for several place-names; they were followed by Arabs and Near-Eastern merchants, and later by Phoenicians and others from the Western world, before the Christian era. It has been surmised that King Solomon's mariners visited Mount Ophir in Johore.

The village of Tebrau may have given its name to the Straits of Tumeras, and the Tamarus promontorium (Ramunia Point) of Strabo.

Certainly, since the first century when the peninsula probably obtained its present form, Johore (Ujong Tanah, Land's End) must have been a salient feature on the voyage from India to China.

In the 9th century the Arabs regularly visited the mart of Betuman, situated near the Straits, to collect the camphor and other valuable products which filtered down from the Endau district.

As the Buddhist State of Palembang grew in power, colonies of Malays commenced to settle on the Peninsula. The "Ma-li-yü-erh" of Chinese writers had, in 1296, long at variance with Siam. Marco Polo (1292) mentions the city of Malavir. Singapore, founded under the name of Tamasek about this time, was ruled by its own kings. A Siamese law of 1360 includes Ujong Tanah, Malaka, and Malay among tributary states. One Raja Chulan, who reigned over the south of the Peninsula, had a fort of black stone on the Johore River.

This nascent development was nipped in the bud by the invasion of the Javanese from Majapahit, who in 1377 conquered the country and destroyed Singapore under circumstances of great brutality.

Malacca, however, grew to be the first trading centre of the East, and after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511, the son of the conquered King settled at Johore Lama and founded the historic Sultanate of Johore.

The history of the next 300 years, however, is an almost uninterrupted record of wars. Persistent hostilities with the Portuguese continued nearly until the arrival of the Dutch in 1602. The State bears no small part in Dutch Colonial history; relations were friendly, despite a
diplomatic struggle for commercial privileges. But, after violent attacks by the Achinese, Johore had become by 1637 practically an appanage of the Achinese kingdom. In return for assistance rendered at the successful attack on Malacca in 1641, the Dutch tried to restore Johore to its former position as the premier Malay State. A port with a customs officer existed at Singapore. But the capital was plundered and burnt by Jambi in 1673; in 1699 the Sultan was assassinated, and in 1717 the throne was seized by a Sumatran adventurer, Raja Kechil. Then the Bugis ships appeared. The subsequent process, partly conquest, partly assimilation, while disturbing to Johore, resulted in a wide extension of its sovereignty, which now spread to Pahang, Siak, Riau, Linggi and part of Selangor.

After 60 years of continuous intrigues between the Malay and Bugis chiefs the Dutch in 1784 recognised the Malay Sultan as ruler of Johore, drove the Bugis from Riau and stationed there a Resident with a garrison; after some further fighting the Malay Sultan and the Bugis viceroy accepted the position of dependent princes, but the old empire of Johore (Linggi and Klang had been ceded to the Dutch in 1757) was in a state of dissolution, the Bendahara and Temenggong being virtually territorial chiefs in Pahang and Johore respectively. This was the position when the English, by virtue of treaties made in 1819 and 1824, obtained a complete cession of the island of Singapore.

Contemporary visitors emphasize the deserted character of the country; in 1847 the capital consisted merely of 25 huts. (In 1856 the capital was moved to its present situation at Johore Bahru.) But the extension of the Pax Britannica and the assistance rendered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements “helped Johore to grow populous again,” moreover, the country has been governed since 1862 by two enlightened and progressive rulers, Sultan Abubakar, who died in 1896, and Sultan Ibrahim the present ruler.

In 1896 the Sultan undertook to receive a British Agent having the functions of a Consular Officer; in 1910, the Sultan having had an unofficial adviser for some years, reorganised his Government with the assistance of the Governor of the Straits Settlements; in 1914 a General Adviser with enlarged powers was appointed. The recent history of the State has been a record of continued prosperity. Telephonic communication was established between Johore and Singapore in 1883; a postal service was inaugurated in 1884, letters being transported by coach till the opening of the railway across Singapore Island in 1903; in 1909 the Johore State railway, linking up with the Federated Malay States Railway system, was completed; finally, in 1924, the completion of the causeway across the Straits permits uninterrupted railway connection between Singapore and Bangkok.

**Constitution.**

In 1896 the Sultan promulgated a written constitution, to which supplements have been added.

His Highness has a Council of Ministers, consisting entirely of high Malay Officers of State, together with an Executive Council consisting of certain Malay and British officers.

The Orders of the Executive Council are carried out by a Civil Service containing Malay and European Officers.

The Legislature consists of a Council of State, to which Asiatic and European official and unofficial members are appointed.

The Judicial system resembles that of the Federated Malay States, minor cases being decided by Magistrates, with appeal to the Supreme Court, and major cases by the Supreme Court, with appeal to the Court of Appeal, and thence in special cases to the Privy Council.

Cases involving matters regulated by Muhammadan law are decided in the Court of a Kathi, with appeal to the Sultan in Executive Council.

Judges of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and of the Federated Malay States are ex-officio Judges of the State of Johore, and vice versa.

Johore is primarily an agricultural State. Forest Reserves amount to 110,903 acres and are being largely increased.

The total area of alienated land on 1st Jan., 1929, was 1,044,444 acres.

The chief agricultural exports in 1929 were:

| Area | Value of Exports |

The principal minerals exported in 1929 were:

- Tin-ore, 18,675 tons.
- Iron-ore, 743,312 tons.
- China clay, 741 tons.

the total value of mineral exports amounting to $8,626,626.

The chief imports comprise rice, wines and spirits, tobacco, wood and timber (largely Johore Produce re-imported from Singapore), cotton-goods and petroleum products.

A branch of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is established at Johore Bahru, and a Chinese bank at Muar.
Manufacturing industries are in their infancy, being confined to 10 pineapple factories, 17 tapioca factories, and a few saw-mills, brickworks, and similar undertakings.

A larger electric power station is being erected at Johore Bahru; stations will shortly be erected at Muar and Segamat.

Communications.

Sea.—Regular steamship services run between the various coast ports and Singapore.

During 1929, 123 ocean-going steamers with a tonnage of 395,958; 10,121 coasting steamers with a tonnage of 186,928; and 4,643 sailing vessels with a tonnage of 193,886 entered ports in the State.

There was a large increase in the number and tonnage of Japanese ocean-going steamers calling at Batu Pahat to load iron-ore. The total weight of ore so cleared was 743,209 tons in 1929.

Railway.—The Johore State Railway runs for 120 miles through the middle of the State from Gemas on the northern boundary to Johore Bahru on the southern boundary; it is connected on each boundary with the system of the Federated Malay States Railway administration, by whom it was built and to whom it is leased.

Road.—At the end of 1929, 130 miles of main town roads and 733 miles of metalled country roads were being maintained. All the principal towns are now connected by a road-system which is being continually extended.

Hired cars provide a cheap, constant, and rapid means of communication. About 1,200 motor vehicles a day cross the causeway connecting the mainland with Singapore Island.

Posts, Telegraphs, Telephones.—In addition to the General Post Office at Johore Bahru, 16 branch offices are established.

28 telephone exchanges are in operation, and the number will be increased. Communication is established between Johore Bahru and Singapore, and between Muar and the Malacca and Federated Malay States systems.

Accommodation.—The Johore Hotel at Johore Bahru provides the usual accommodation for travellers; the Government also maintains Rest Houses at Muar, Batu Pahat, Kota Tinggi, Segamat, Batu Anam, Mersing, and Kluang.

General.

Health.—Government Hospitals are established in the principal townships, besides a Mental Hospital and Leper Asylum at Johore Bahru. Permanent anti-malarial measures are being undertaken in Johore Bahru and other townships; and culling operations are in force in all towns.

Travelling dispensaries will shortly be provided.

Education.—The Government has established 6 English Schools and 129 vernacular schools; further, the Government maintains five advanced Malay students at Hongkong and in England.

Grants-in-aid are made to estate Tamil schools.

Military Forces.—The total strength of the Johore Military Forces in 1929 amounted to 656. There are English and Malay Volunteer contingents.

Police.—The force numbers 1,116, all ranks; the rank and file consist of Malays and Sikhs under Malay and English Officers.

Municipal.—Town Boards are established at Johore Bahru, Muar, Batu Pahat, Segamat, Kota Tinggi and Endau, supervising sanitary work in 26 Town Board Areas and many village areas.

Sport.—Subject to the regulations for the protection of wild animals, special permits may be obtained to shoot elephant, gaur, rhinoceros, tapir, deer, tiger, panther, crocodile, an pig.

KEDAH.

H.H. Sir Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibni Ahmad Tajudin, K.C.M.G., Sultan; H.H. Tunku Ibrahim, C.M.G., C.V.O., Regent.

Kedah is a State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula situated between the parallels of 5° 5' and 6° 35' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 36' and 101° 10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (north and east) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the south. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the north of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern watershed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 106 miles in length and about 65 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi groups, about 3,648 square miles. The four highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Bintang (6,103 feet), Gunong Kangar (4,760 feet), Gunong Jerai (3,978 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,828 feet). Gunong Raia, on Langkawi Island, is 2,950 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammedanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was, at various times, under the domination of Burmah, Aceh, Malacca, and Siam. Like the other States, too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul Perlis, and part of Singgora on the north, and Krian on the south, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders, its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Opperhoofden (Commandants) in Kedah from 1664 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese, and held the country
from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammed Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1841 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis, and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammadans. Only a few families of the aborigines (Semang) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River. They numbered 105 all told at the 1911 census.

South Kedah, the area lying south of the mountain known as Kedah Peak (Gunong Jerai), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils, planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying lands along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang and to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 246,986 at the 1911 census. At the 1921 census the population was 338,544, of whom 300 were Europeans, 75 Eurasians, 237,043 Malays, 59,403 Chinese, 33,019 Indians and 8,704 “other races.” The estimated population in 1928 was 399,864.

Galenas have been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered, with the exception of a deposit of marble which may prove to be of value.

Climate.

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the daytime rising to over 90 deg. F. and falling to nearly 70 deg. F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply, which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

Communications.

Steamers ply between Penang and Sungei Petani (Central Kedah), and between Penang and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawiland.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 45 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road extends to Kuala Nerang at the 23rd mile from Alor Star. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak, and other metalled roads have been completed or are under construction. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns; 260 miles of canals and 33 miles of irrigation channels are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Mertajam, in Province Wellesley and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier. Trains have been running regularly since October, 1915. A connection through Perlis with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There are English schools in Alor Star (611 pupils) and Sungai Patani (201 pupils) and a Malay Girls’ school in Alor Star. There are 83 Malay schools, including 5 girls’ schools.

Constitution.

Until the beginning of this century the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

In 1905, the Sultan by an edict appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country. The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud who was in turn succeeded in 1918 by H.H. Tungku Ibrahim. The Adviser and the Chief Malay Judge are ex-officio members, and two members may be nominated.

In 1913, the Sultan’s health became such that it was necessary to appoint his eldest son, Tunku Ibrahim, as Regent, pending the restoration of the Sultan’s health.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,600,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent. The Federated Malay States Government paid the interest, $120,963, due at the time of
the transfer, and added it on to the capital, thus making the loan amount to $2,720,953.

The public revenue and expenditure during the last five years were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1344 (A.D. 1926) | $9,179,487 | $5,481,218 |
| A.H. 1345 (A.D. 1927) | $9,988,428 | $6,396,507 |
| A.H. 1346 (A.D. 1928) | $7,722,507 | $7,335,338 |
| A.H. 1347 (A.D. 1929) | $6,886,576 | $7,246,091 |
| A.H. 1348 (A.D. 1930) | $6,686,701 | $6,937,399 |

The whole of the loan due to the F.M.S. Government has been paid off. The State is now free from debt.

Trade.

The following were the principal exports from Kedah during the year 1348 (9/6/29 to 28/5/30):

- Padi and rice, rubber, tapioca and sago, forest produce, tin-ore, fish, bricks, cattle, hides and horns, pigs and poultry.

The value of the Kedah trade with the Straits during 1348 was as follows:

- Exports, $29,520,743; imports, $7,943,137.

The value of Kedah trade with the F.M.S. during 1348, was:

- Exports, $1,390,133; imports, $133,922.

Perlis.

H.H. Syed Alwi, C.B.E., Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula north of Kedah. Its area is 316 square miles.

* Malayan Civil Service.
Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano. The Federated Malay States Railway runs through the State and connects with the Siamese railway system at Padang Besar. H.H. the Raja resides at Arau which is on the railway. The main Government Offices are at Kangar, about six miles from Arau. There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Kangar and a telephone system exists between the police stations in the State. There are 36½ miles of metalled roads and 261 miles of gravelled roads and paths kept up by Government.

The population is about 45,000, of whom some 40,000 are Malays. The public revenue and expenditure for the last five years were respectively:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1344 (A.D. 1926) | 594,098 | 565,071 |
| A.H. 1345 (A.D. 1927) | 614,665 | 630,768 |
| A.H. 1346 (A.D. 1928) | 645,114 | 622,762 |
| A.H. 1347 (A.D. 1929) | 583,329 | 584,065 |
| A.H. 1348 (A.D. 1930) | 487,436 | 573,738 |

The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. Repayment of these loans was completed in 1929, and the State is now free from debt. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The relations between Perlis and Great Britain are defined in a Treaty signed at Aron on 28th April, 1930.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 4° 35' and 6° 15' north, and between longitudes 101° 22' and 102° 37' east. It is bounded on the north by the China Sea; on the east by Trengganu; on the south by Pahang; and on the west by Perak and Siamese Territory. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,713 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the state according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the south. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabal, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1921 Census was 309,300, including 127 Europeans, 286,334 Malays, 12,779 Chinese, 3,622 Indians, and 6,396 others.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 12,000 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has seven schools attended by some 976 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Kuala Krai has been completed. It is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Puteh, Kuala Krai, Pasir Mas, Bachok, and Plekbang.
Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 2,500), Bachok (population 800), on the coast, Pasir Puteh (population 900), and Kuala Krai, the headquarters of the southern district of the State. The trunk road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai is open for traffic.

Pasir Puteh is connected with Kota Bharu by a road which is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, which will eventually connect Kelantan with Singapore, has been completed as regards the section between Tumpat and Kuala Gris, and the section between Pahang and Gua Musang, while communication with Penang is now established with a daily train service each way.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the annual harvest of which amounts to 70,000 tons. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown in the coastal plain. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years; in addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. The area under rubber is about 89,213 acres, of which rather more than one half comprises Asiatic holdings. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, though it has been necessary temporarily to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of silk sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Some 2,335 acres are held on ore mining titles for tin ore, but the production is as yet small; the only metallic export of the year being some 13 tons of tin ore.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, rubber, cattle, betelnuts, fish, and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are rice, tobacco, cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 103 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, but a coin made from an alloy of tin and lead and called pittis is also current in the bazaar; 480 pittis equal one dollar.

Regular steamer communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

**Trengganu.**

H.H. Sulaiman Badarul-alam Shah,
K.C.M.G., bin Almerhum Zainalabidin, Sultan.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 30' and 5° 45' North, and longitude 102° 15' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 5,500 square miles.

The total population of the State, as recorded by the census taken in April, 1921, is 153,765. This total is made up as follows:

- European and kindred races ... 34
- Malay races ... ... ... 145,523
- Chinese ... ... ... 7,246
- Indians ... ... ... 211
- Other nationalities ... ... ... 751

There are some 92 miles of road open to traffic. A trunk road from Kuala Trengganu to the Kelantan boundary is under construction. When completed this road will be 60 miles in length. There are no railways. Communication with the interior is entirely by means of the rivers and good native paths. Telegraphic communication was established between the State, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements in 1922. There are telephone exchanges at Kuala Trengganu, Kemaman and Besut.
The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 12,453.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretai, Dungun, Paka, Marang, Ibar, Stiu, and Besut.

The public revenue and expenditure in A.H. 1348 (8-6-29 to 28-5-30) were $1,391,471 and $1,624,706 respectively.

Total value of exports from Trengganu in 1929, was $7,191,427, and of imports $5,898,556. The principal exports and imports were:

**EXPORTS**

| Item                  | Value     |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Tin ore               | $1,607,230|

**IMPORTS**

|-------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Rice                                      | $667,528  |
| Tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes            | 397,937   |
| Cotton stuffs                             | 556,358   |
| Sugar                                     | 236,760   |
| Petroleum                                 | 236,232   |

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the north-east monsoon from November to February. The annual average is about 120 inches. The temperature ranges between 63° and 92° F., the greatest range in 24 hours being 26°. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper.

During part of the north-east monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable. British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909. The suzerainty of Siam, transferred on that date to Great Britain, was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the Bunga Mas to Bangkok. This tribute is not now rendered either to Siam or to Great Britain.

An Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainal Abidin was signed in Singapore in 1910.

This agreement of four articles provides that mutual help shall be rendered by the two Governments, and for the rendition of fugitive criminals. It also provides for the appointment of a British Officer to reside in Trengganu to be an Agent with functions similar to those of a Consular Officer. His Majesty's Government undertake to protect the Government and the State of Trengganu and all its Dependencies from attack by foreign enemies, and the Trengganu Government surrenders the management of all political matters with Foreign Governments to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The limitation of mining and agricultural concessions to any person other than natives and subjects of Trengganu is also provided for.

This agreement was amended on May 24th, 1919. Under the amended agreement the Sultan agrees to accept a British Officer, called the British Adviser, whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues.

The ruling line of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainal Abidin, through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

Two loans of $1,000,000 each granted by the Straits Government in 1923 and 1926 have enabled Trengganu to resume large Ruling House Land Concessions and to commence a programme of surveys, road construction, and other development works.

A further loan of $1,500,000 for the continuation of the road programme was approved by the Straits Government in 1928, and $400,000 drawn during A.H. 1,348.

The mining and agricultural resources of the State are at present practically untouchable.

**BRUNEI**

**H.H. Ahmed Tajudin, Sultan.**

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 114° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. It is 770 nautical miles distant from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 2,500 square miles, containing a population of about 30,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait, and Temburong.
In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei, and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 13,000.

Besides the old Malay town which is built over the water on the Brunei River there is a new township on the mainland which has steadily developed since 1910. There are vernacular schools at Brunei and in some of the out-districts. The climate resembles that of the Federated Malay States. The average annual rainfall at Brunei is a little over 100 inches.

Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 1,000 in the capital. Native industries include fishing, cloth weaving, brass foundries, and the manufacture of silversmiths' ware. The principal imports are rice, cloth, tobacco, sugar, and petroleum, and the principal exports cutch (mangrove extract), wild and plantation rubber, sago, and dried prawns. The trade, to which an impetus was given by the inauguration of the new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber, while oil prospecting is being vigorously developed.

A cutch factory, established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei. The output of cutch in 1929 was 2,086 tons, valued at $183,683.

There are two native industries of importance, the manufacture of brassware and silverware, and these are more or less restricted to certain families or guilds. Weaving is done by Brunei women, and the natives are excellent fishermen.

The British Malayan Petroleum Co., Ltd., carry on drilling and prospecting operations for petroleum. The company has established a wharf and wireless station at Kuala Belait.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from land and mining rents, from an opium monopoly under Government control, from the collection of customs duties, and from purchased Cession moneys. About half of the original Cession moneys have now been purchased by the Government.

| 1929 | $345,290 | $344,092    |

The public debt on the 31st December, 1929, was $407,000.

Communications.

There is regular communication with Labuan by steam launch and so with Singapore by the Straits Steamship Company, which maintains a weekly service.

A Central Wireless Telegraph Station was opened in 1921 at Brunei with a subsidiary station at Labuan which enables telegraphic communication to be maintained with Labuan and thence by cable with Singapore and Europe. There are other Wireless Stations in the Belait and Temburong Districts.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.

*TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Tanganyika Territory consists of that portion of the former Colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the Colony, namely the districts of Ruanda and Urundi in the North-West, and the Kionga Area, South of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Umba River on the North to the Rovuma River on the South, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands. The Northern Boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Moburu Point), and thence along the first parallel of latitude until it strikes the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River to approximately latitude 2°25', and thence along the eastern boundary of Urundi to the Mlagamasi River which it follows to Lake Tanganyika. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the centre line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows to Kasanga (formerly Bismarckburg), at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Rhodesia to the northern end of Lake Nyasa and continues along the centre line of Lake Nyasa to a point due west of the Rovuma River whence the boundary runs east and joins the Ruvuma River, whose course it follows to the sea. The total area of the Territory is about 374,085 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of water.

The Island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

General Description.

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply

* Malayan Civil Service.
† For map see under Kenya.
from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,590 feet; Nyassa, 1,607 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 35,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which has a population of 25,000, and is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa, and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway; Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,720 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,960 feet). In the south-west are the Livingstone Mountains, where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz.: the southern portion of Lake Victoria, the eastern shores of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika, and the northern and north-eastern shores of Lake Nyasa. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

Climate.

The climate of the Territory varies greatly according to the height above sea-level of the several districts. Roughly, four climatic zones can be distinguished, though even among these there are considerable local variations:—(i) The warm and rather damp coast region with its adjoining hinterland.—Here, conditions are tropical, though not unpleasant except just before and during the rainy seasons, when the heat is trying and the atmosphere humid. The average yearly temperature is 78 degrees. (ii) The hot and moderately dry zone between the coast and the central plateau (300 feet—2,000 feet). This zone is characterised by low humidity of atmosphere, less rain, and a temperature rather lower but with greater daily and yearly variations. (iii) The hot and dry zone of the central plateau between 2,000 feet and 4,000 feet in height.—The climate of this zone differs greatly in parts, but its prevailing characteristics are low humidity, little rainfall (at Tabora an annual average of 32 inches), a fairly high mean temperature, with great daily and yearly variations, sometimes exceeding 36 degrees Fahrenheit daily. The heat is dry, but not so trying to the European as the moist and steamy warmth of the coast, while the nights are invariably cold. (iv) The semi-temperate regions around the slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru, of the Usambara Highlands, the Ulipa Plateau, and the mountainous areas of the south-western area (5,000 feet—10,000 feet).—Frosts occur at the higher altitudes, and the nights are cold. These districts enjoy a bracing climate, and alone can be considered healthy for Europeans, but prolonged residence in these altitudes is apt to produce nervous strain, even though physical fitness is maintained. There are two well-defined rainy seasons annually. Generally speaking, the long rains begin in February or March, and last for two or three months, while the short rainy season extends from October to November, but the rainfall is low for a tropical country, and droughts are not infrequent.

History.

Plentiful evidence exists of Arab traders having visited the Territory for several centuries and of their opening up the great slave route from Dagamayo on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. The British explorer, Burton, first entered the Territory in 1856, and was soon followed by Speke, Livingstone, and Stanley.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made twelve treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilima Njaro and occupied Moshi on March 13th of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's Forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on January 1st, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in January, 1919, appointing an Administrator. The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on September 26th, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council. In March, 1921, the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ulipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

In December, 1920, draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in July, 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain lays down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of States members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated the 19th of March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, thirteen official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on the 1st July, 1926.
Population.

The number of Europeans in Tanganyika Territory is approximately 6,630. There are also over 18,000 Indians, 4,000 Arabs and 1,000 Goans. The natives are estimated at 4,794,019. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important language is Swahili, which is a hybrid between Arabic and Persian and all sorts of African tongues. It is more or less spoken as a lingua franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south, and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but the majority of the coastal tribes and a few in the hinterland profess Mohammedanism.

The territory is divided into 11 Provinces as follows:

| Provinces | Capital |
|-----------|---------|
| Central   | Dodoma  |
| Tanga     | Tanga   |
| Northern  | Arusha  |
| Eastern   | Dar-es-Salaam |

| Kigoma    | Kigoma  |
| Tabora    | Tabora  |
| Mwanza    | Mwanza  |
| Bukoba    | Bukoba  |

The Missions reported the existence during 1929 of 2,903 schools with a roll of upward of 81,000 pupils. There are 88 native schools conducted by Government with a roll of 6,544 and an average attendance of 80%. Government also conducts two central schools for Indian children and supports other Indian schools with grants-in-aid. Provision is also being made for the secondary education of European children and, in the meantime, Government aids several primary schools for European children in the Northern Province and conducts a junior European school in Dar-es-Salaam and Correspondence Course for the children of settlers in remote areas.

* In 1927-28 only the net Railway Revenue was included in the Territory's Revenue. Previous years include the gross Railway Revenue. In 1922-29 and 1929-30 the Railway Revenue is excluded entirely.

Sisal continues to be the principal article of export. Other articles in order of value are coffee, cotton, hides and skins, copra, groundnuts, grain, diamonds, sisimim, beeswax, seed cotton, gum arabic, gold, ghee, bark for tanning, ivory, salt, gum copal, mica.

The total area under close forest is approximately 4,071 square miles, of which 95.2 per cent. is in Government Forest Reserves, 3.4 per cent. awaits reservation and 1.4 per cent. is valuable forest in private ownership. The forests are most numerous in the north, on the shores and islands of Lake Victoria Nyanza; in the north-east on Kilimanjaro and Meru Mountains; in the east along the Pare and Usambara ranges and in the Uluguru and Nguu Mountains; and at the coast, in the districts of Rufiji, Kilwa and Lindi. Further considerable areas of close forest are situated in the Highlands of Iringa Province, some of which are only being explored now for the first time. Such are the forests of Ukwama, Kisings, and Nyumbanito, totalling over 150 square miles. The number of timber producing species is large and includes among many others the following:-Pencil Cedar (Juniperus procera), Podocarpus, Chlorophora excelsa (resembling Burma Teak), Ocotea Usambarensis, Pterocarpus Bussei, Parinarium Holstii, Pygeum africanum, Afzelia cuanzenisis, Khaya Senegalensis and Cassipourea Eikii. In addition, valuable species of hardwoods occur as single trees or in groups widely scattered throughout large areas of dry savannah forest. Mangroves of excellent quality cover large areas of the littoral. Ebony and gum copal are plentiful near the coast. Bamboo and baobab are found and may prove suitable for the manufacture of paper pulp.

The following have been mined for export or local use:-Gold, diamonds, mica, salt, tin and red ochre. Other minerals known to exist include:-Coal, copper, iron, graphite, asbestos, and soda. Extensive areas remain to be prospected. The total mineral production for 1929 was valued at £193,322.

Communications.

The Territory is served by two Railways of metre gauge.

1. The Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika (77½ miles), with a branch line from Tabora (525 miles) to Mwanza (238 miles) on Lake Victoria.

2. The Tanga or Northern Railway from Tanga via Moshi (219 miles) to Arusha (272 miles). The extension Moshi to Arusha was completed in May, 1930. From Kahe Junction (208 miles) a line links up with the Kenya and Uganda Railway at Voi. The Voi-Kahe line is run under the management of the Kenya and Uganda Railway.

The two feet gauge line in the Lindi District was closed down in March, 1930. A narrow gauge (75 c.m.) line, taking off from the Tanga Railway at Tengeni (274 miles) runs to Sigi (16 miles) serving the Amani Institute.

Light motor traffic is now possible over 12,170 miles of roads during the dry season.

The ports of Lake Victoria are served by the steamers of the Kenya and Uganda Marine; those of Lake Nyasa by the Nyasaland Government steamers, and the Tanganyika Railways steamship "Liemba," and a smaller one "Mwanza," together with a Belgian service, maintains communications on Lake Tanganyika. The British steamer "Liemba" (late German s.s. "Goetzen," 796 and 427 tons gross and net respectively) was put into commission on
from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,590 feet, Nyasa, 1,607 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 35,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which has a population of 25,000, and is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa, and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway; Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,720 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,960 feet). In the south-west are the Livingstone Mountains, where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz.: the southern portion of Lake Victoria, the eastern shores of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika, and the northern and north-eastern shores of Lake Nyasa. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

June 9th, 1927, and maintains a fortnightly service to Mplungu, in Northern Rhodesia, via Albertville and Southern Lake Ports.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The telegraph system comprises 3,677 route miles with 7,080 miles of wire, and the number of offices, including railway telegraph offices, open for public business is 118. The principal offices are Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Lindi on the coast, Bukoba and Mwanza on Lake Victoria, Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika, Kilosa, Dodoma and Tabora on the Central Railway Line, Moshi on the Kenya Border and Tukuyu on the Nyassaland Border.

The inland telegraph system forms a link of land line communication between Kenya and Uganda to the north, and Nyassaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and the rest of South Africa, while communication is established with the Belgian Congo through a wireless station at Kigoma.

Dar-es-Salaam is connected by cable with Zanzibar, through which is established communication with all parts of the world.

Trunk Telephone communication is provided on some of the important routes by utilising the telegraph wires when required, while between Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam the telegraph is superimposed on a permanent trunk, with an extension to Mombasa.

Twenty-six Telephone Exchange centres are established, comprising 185 route miles with 859 miles of wire, in addition to a number of rural installations comprising 26 route miles with 70 miles of wire.

Letter mails from Great Britain are despatched from London weekly via Marseilles, whence they are conveyed direct by vessels of the Messageries Maritimes, and by the P. & O. line via Aden, the average time in transit being 22 days. Letter mails to Great Britain are despatched from Dar-es-Salaam by all available steamers.

Parcel mails are despatched weekly by steamers of the P. & O. line from London by the all-sea route to Aden, whence they are conveyed by any steamer proceeding to Mombasa or beyond. The Aden-Mombasa-Dar-es-Salaam service is irregular, and the average time of transit of parcel mails from London to Dar-es-Salaam is 30 days.

Fortnightly mail services are maintained with India and South Africa, and there is a frequent exchange of mails by sea with Kenya Colony and Zanzibar.

Places on the Central Railway line between Dar-es-Salaam and Tabora exchange mails five times weekly, between Tabora and Kigoma four times weekly, on the Mwanza line between Tabora and Mwanza twice weekly, on the Tanga-Moshi-Arusha line between Tanga and Korogwe daily, between Korogwe and Buiko five times weekly and between Buiko and Arusha twice weekly. Outlying districts served by motor or runner have a mail service weekly, and in a few cases more frequently.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The telegraph system comprises 3,577 route miles with 7,080 poles of wire, and the number of offices, including railway telegraph offices, open for public business is 118. The principal offices are Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Lindi on the coast, Bukoba and Mwanza on Lake Victoria, Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika, Kilosa, Dodoma and Tabora on the Central Railway Line, Moshi on the Kenya Border and Tukuyu on the Nyasaland Border.

The inland telegraph system forms a link of land line communication between Kenya and Uganda to the north, and Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and the rest of South Africa, while communication is established with the Belgian Congo through a wireless station at Kigoma.

Dar-es-Salaam is connected by cable with Zanzibar, through which is established communication with all parts of the world.

Trunk Telephone communication is provided on some of the important routes by utilising the telegraph wires when required, while between Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam the telegraph is superimposed on a permanent trunk, with an extension to Mombasa.

Twenty-six Telephone Exchange centres are established, comprising 185 route miles with 859 miles of wire, in addition to a number of rural installations comprising 26 route miles with 70 miles of wire.

Letter mails from Great Britain are despatched from London weekly via Marseilles, whence they are conveyed direct by vessels of the Messageries Maritimes, and by the P. & O. line via Aden, the average time in transit being 22 days. Letter mails to Great Britain are despatched from Dar-es-Salaam by all available steamers.

Parcel mails are despatched weekly by steamers of the P. & O. line from London by the all-sea route to Aden, whence they are conveyed by any steamer proceeding to Mombasa or beyond. The Aden-Mombasa-Dar-es-Salaam service is irregular, and the average time of transit of parcel mails from London to Dar-es-Salaam is 30 days.

Fortnightly mail services are maintained with India and South Africa, and there is a frequent exchange of mails by sea with Kenya Colony and Zanzibar.

Places on the Central Railway line between Dar-es-Salaam and Tabora exchange mails five times weekly, between Tabora and Kigoma four times weekly, on the Mwanza line between Tabora and Mwanza twice weekly, on the Tanga-Moshi-Arusha line between Tanga and Korogwe daily, between Korogwe and Buiko five times weekly and between Buiko and Arusha twice weekly. Outlaying districts served by motor or runner have a mail service weekly, and in a few cases more frequently.
