UGANDA.

(For Map see under Kenya.)

Extent and Boundaries.

The British Protectorate over Buganda was proclaimed on August 27th, 1894. The Protectorate was further extended over Bunyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Buganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth as follows:—

On the east by Kenya Colony as far north as Mount Zulim, near the 4th degree of north latitude, the natural boundaries being the Turkana escarpment, Mount Elgon, and the Sio River running into the north-east corner of Lake Victoria; on the south, by Tanganyika Territory and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the frontier of the Belgian Congo, the natural boundaries being Lake Edward, Mt. Ruwenzori, the Semliki River, Lake Albert and the Nile watershed; and on the north, by the Uganda-Sudan boundary.

The area of the Uganda Protectorate is estimated at 94,204 square miles, including 13,616 square miles of water. Pending the complete survey of the country, it is not possible to give the correct area.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate is divided into four provinces (Eastern, Northern, Western, and Buganda), and then again into numerous districts.

The headquarters of the Uganda administration are at Entebbe, and the chief commercial towns in the Protectorate are Kampala and Jinja; all three are on or near the North shore of Lake Victoria.

Climate.

The climate, when compared with that of some tropical countries, is not unpleasant, but there are parts of the country which can by no means be called healthy. The conditions vary with the altitude in different parts of the Protectorate: the Nile Valley, which lies about 2,000 feet above sea-level, is hot, and is considerably more unhealthy than the higher-lying regions between Lakes Victoria and Albert. The most congenial climate for European residence is found in the Buganda kingdom and in the Western Province, where in some districts the altitude exceeds 5,000 feet above sea-level. European children thrive well in infancy in a few of the healthier stations, but considerable risk is attached to bringing them out when over six or seven years old, as they are always liable to attacks of malaria and the anaemia and general ill-health resulting therefrom.

The climate is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the year 1929 at Entebbe being—Mean maximum, 79.8° Fahrenheit; mean minimum, 63.0° Fahrenheit. Average daily sunshine, 7.3 hours.

The lowest rainfall for 1929 was recorded at Butaba, which registered 27.85 inches, the highest (76.23 inches) being recorded at Kalangala, Sese Islands.

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February.

The healthiest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the least healthy, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to those immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes become more in evidence and malarial infections more numerous.
No part of the Uganda Protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Ankole in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria prevails at all seasons of the year.

Sleeping sickness, which proved such a scourge to the country in 1902 and the years following and necessitated the evacuation of the natives from the islands in Victoria Nyanza, and from the shores of the great lakes and rivers, is now well under control. During 1921 and 1922 the island population was to a great extent restored and many of the islands were successfully reopened. The focus of the disease is no longer on Lake Victoria.

Plague and smallpox are unfortunately endemic in the native population, but it has been possible to confine outbreaks for the most part within narrow limits. Active measures against these diseases are constantly engaging the attention of the medical and administrative authorities.

History.

The countries that now make up the Uganda Protectorate did not become known to Europe until the journey of Speke and Grant in search of the sources of the Nile, which brought them to Buganda in 1862 and to Bunyoro a year later. In both countries they found a somewhat advanced indigenous civilisation, and it is around the rivalries of these two principalities that all the early history of the country centres. The Swahili form of "Buganda," the country of the Baganda people, has been adopted as the name of the whole Protectorate, although there are many other quite separate races and tribes among its inhabitants. Speke's discoveries were not at first credited, but were soon confirmed by Sir Samuel Baker and his wife who discovered Lake Albert. The first missionaries arrived in Buganda in 1877, and the rivalries of Protestant, Catholic and Mohammedan which soon naturally arose ended after the death of the old king, Mutesa, and the accession of his weak and vacillating son, Mwanga, to the throne in 1884, in bloodshed. The Imperial British East Africa Company which, after concluding a treaty with Mwanga in 1890, had occupied Kampala with a weak force under Capt. Lugard, had much difficulty in trying to compose these rivalries, and would have been forced to abandon the country but for the intervention of the British Government, which sent out a Special Commissioner, Sir Gerald Portal, in 1893. His enquiry and negotiations led to the establishment of the Protectorate in the following year. For three years the country remained quiet, but in 1897 mutiny broke out among some of the Sudanese troops who had been recruited by the Company from the remains of the Egyptian forces cut off by the Mahdist rebellion. It soon spread to all the discontented elements, but was ultimately overcome after having seriously menaced British rule. Finally the two kings—Mwanga of Buganda and Kabarega of Bunyoro—who had always resented European penetration and had seized upon the mutiny as a good opportunity to put an end to it, were captured and deported.

Since then there is little but peaceful progress to record. Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government in 1900 as Special Commissioner to settle the country, and concluded agreements with the heads of the native principalities of Buganda, Toro and Ankole, which laid down the principles governing their administrative relations with the Crown and the ownership of the land. No such arrangements could be made at the time with regard to the rest of the present Protectorate, but administration has since been extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganised tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" have been followed wherever and whenever it was possible as in the "agreement districts." In 1903 the Eastern highlands of the Protectorate along with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony, and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of frontiers with the Sudan, the Belgian Congo, and German East Africa, now Tanganyika Territory. In 1903 the superintendence of the Protectorates affairs passed from the Foreign to the Colonial Office. In the Great War the population, of all races, remained devotedly loyal and played a great part in the East African campaign. Since then progress, both material and cultural, has continued, the former made possible by the success of the cotton industry and the development of communications, the latter based on the activities of the missions, both Protestant and Catholic, in whose hands was all educational work until 1925.

Constitution.

By the Uganda Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council both consisting of such persons as may be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated the 5th June, 1920, the Executive Council consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, and Director of Medical and Sanitary Services (ex-officio members), and such other persons holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such other persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President.

It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor, Attorney-General, Treasurer, and Director of Medical and Sanitary Services (ex-officio members), with official and unofficial members as in the case of the Executive Council.

The membership of both Councils has now been increased by the addition of the Director of Education and the Director of Agriculture.

The Native Government of Buganda has certain rights of internal legislation granted by agreement. The king or Kabaka, who is accorded the title of "His Highness," rules the Buganda people with the advice of the Governor and of a native Council known as the Lukiko, which also has judicial functions.

Communications.

The Uganda Protectorate is separated by about 500 miles from the nearest point on the east coast of Africa. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the Colony of Kenya, transport was exceedingly difficult before the construction of the "Uganda Railway" from Mombasa to the north-east corner of Lake Victoria, which the Imperial Government decided in 1895 to undertake. This railway at the end of 1901 had covered the whole 684 miles separating Mombasa from Kisumu on Victoria Nyanza, which was the terminus of the railway until recent years.

There is a weekly Lake Steamer Service connecting Entebbe, Port Bell (Kampala), and Jinja with
Kisumu, and a fortnightly service to the other ports on Lake Victoria. Steamers ply also on Lake Kioga and on Lake Albert and the Albert Nile as far north as Nimule. All these services are maintained by the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours Administration.

A railway, 62 miles long, from Jinja to Namasagali on the Victoria Nile, giving access to the waterways of Lake Kioga, was completed in 1912, and one from Port Bell on Lake Victoria to Kampala, the principal commercial centre, a distance of 73 miles, was opened for public traffic in 1915.

Since the Great War considerable railway development has taken place, and a main line of the Kenya and Uganda Railway, leaving the original line at Nakuru, now extends into the Eastern Province of Uganda to join the Jinja-Namasagali railway at Mbulamuti, and so places Uganda in direct communication with the Coast. An extension of this line from Tororo, near the Kenya border, to Mbale and Soroti was completed in 1929, and the linking up of Jinja with Kampala—a scheme which involves the bridging of the Victoria Nile at the former place, is expected to be complete by 1931.

The system of all-weather main roads radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres is maintained by the Public Works Department, which has a road mileage of 1,481 under its control. A new system of roads is coming into being in the Western Province, destined to establish connection between the tin-mines and the Kagera River steamship service, to tap the resources of the Ruchuru area of the Belgian Congo for that service, and to link up direct the district headquarters in the west of the Protectorate. The bridge which will take the railway across the Nile at Jinja will carry road-traffic, and eliminate the tiresome ferry-journey which travellers between Kampala and Jinja have at present to undergo. Many miles of excellent roads are also kept up by the Native Administration. Motor-transport, in consequence of these facilities, has reached an advanced stage of development in the Protectorate.

The Uganda Posts and Telegraphs Department is amalgamated with that of Kenya under the control of the Postmaster-General at Nairobi.

Uganda is now in telegraphic communication with Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam by land lines, and thence by cable with Great Britain and other countries. All important centres within the Protectorate are connected also by telegraph.

The total mileage of telegraph and telephone pole route at the end of 1929 was 1,648 and the wire mileage 3,328. Telephone exchanges are worked at Entebbe, Kampala, Jinja, Iganga, and Mbale, and connected by trunk lines.

**Aviation.**

Landing grounds are kept up at Entebbe, Tororo and Jinja, and landing facilities for sea-planes exist at Entebbe, Port Bell near Kampala, and Butiaba. There is no accommodation in Uganda for housing aircraft, but repairs can be carried out at the above places. The projected Cairo-Capetown service of Imperial Airways, Ltd., will give Uganda direct weekly communication by air with Europe and South Africa.

**Commerce.**

Banking facilities are afforded by the National Bank of India Ltd., with branches at Entebbe, Kampala, and Jinja, the Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., with branches at Kampala and Jinja, and by Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Kampala and Jinja.

The weights and measures in common use in the Protectorate are the Imperial weights and measures. The currency is the same as that of Kenya.

Coffee of the Arabica and Robusta varieties has been introduced and thrives exceedingly well; the former is the principal crop on European plantations, and both are being grown in increasing quantities by natives. The principal industry is cotton, and 816,228 centsals of lint, valued at £3,312,684, as well as 67,026 tons of cotton seed, of a value of £23,109, were exported in 1929. Rubber (principally plantation grown), hides and skins, ground-nuts and chillies, are the other principal agricultural exports, and, except for rubber, practically all the production is in native hands. Mineral discoveries have been made in recent years, and there is a steadily rising export of high-grade tin ore from the Western Province. This amounted in 1929 to 321 tons, of a value of £44,617. Cattle are plentiful. Leasehold grants of land can be obtained from the government, but the issue of freehold concessions has been withdrawn for the present.

**Imports.**

The Customs are amalgamated with those of the Colony of Kenya, but every effort is made to determine the imports and exports of Uganda with the greatest possible accuracy for the purpose of dividing the Customs revenue. The following statistics give the value f.o.b. Mombasa of the imports declared for home consumption in Uganda:

| Year | Value (£) |
|------|----------|
| 1925 | 2,677,764 |
| 1926 | 1,964,174 |
| 1927 | 1,819,961 |
| 1928 | 1,988,104 |
| 1929 | 2,318,177 |

**Exports.**

| Year | Value (£) |
|------|----------|
| 1925 | 5,096,717 |
| 1926 | 3,597,437 |
| 1927 | 2,310,260 |
| 1928 | 3,395,270 |
| 1929 | 4,274,758 |

* Exclusive of specie and goods in transit. The destination of exports is not known when the goods leave the Protectorate. Goods are consigned to agents at Mombasa, from which port they are finally exported.

**Finances.**

The Revenue is principally derived from poll taxes, customs duties, cotton tax, trading licences, and land rents. The revenue from poll taxes in 1929 was £588,993, and from customs duties £439,375. There has been no grant-in-aid from the British Government since 1914-15. The unit of currency is the East African shilling.

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |

| 1921 | 803,347    | 786,375        |
| 1922 | 820,365    | 920,228        |

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

(For Scales A, B, C, D and E see footnote page 468).
The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.**

A British Protectorate was proclaimed over the Gilbert Islands by Commanding Officer H. M. Davis of H.M.S. "Royalist" on behalf of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, at Alabemama, on the 27th May, 1892. The Ellice Islands were declared a Protectorate in September of the same year.

The jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Protectorates was extended to Ocean Island by a Proclamation issued on 28th November, 1900.

By the expressed desire of the Native Governments the first two groups were annexed to and formed part of His Majesty's Dominions by an Order in Council of the 10th November, 1915, and were known as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony as from the 12th January, 1916. Ocean, Fanning, and Washington Islands were included within the boundaries of the Colony by an Order of His Majesty in Council of the 27th January, 1916, which came into operation on the 3rd April of that year.

The Union group of Islands was brought in by Order in Council of the 29th February, 1916, operating from the 5th May, 1916; but by the Union Islands (No. 1) Order in Council 1925, dated the 4th Nov., 1925, the boundaries of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony were altered so as to exclude the Union Islands, which by the Union Islands (No. 2) Order in Council, 1925, of the same date were placed under the Governor Gen. in Council of the Dominion of New Zealand. These Orders in Council came into force on 11th Feb., 1926.

Christmas Island was also included in the Colony by Order in Council of the 30th July, 1919, taking effect from the 10th November, 1919.

The total population of the Colony at the Census of April, 1921, was 29,897, of whom 264 were Europeans, 348 Asiatics, and 29,285 Pacific Island natives.

The total population of the Colony on the 31st December, 1928, was 29,403, of whom 259 were Europeans, 756 Asiatics and 28,388 Pacific Island natives.

**Ocean Island** (or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. The population of Ocean Island at the end of December, 1928, was 2,609. Of these 137 were Europeans, 88 of whom were men, 80 of this latter number being employees of the British Phosphate Commissioners. The natives numbered 1,755, of these 554 being Banabans. 64 Banabans and 668 Gilbert and Ellice Islanders are employed by the British Phosphate Commissioners. Besides this labour force, the Commission recruit men from China, of whom there were 716 at Ocean Island at the end of December, 1928.
The population of the Island at that time was as follows:

|                | Men | Women | Children | Totals |
|----------------|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| Europeans      | 88  | 28    | 21       | 137    |
| Asiatics       |     |       |          | 717    |
| Gilbert & Ellice Labourers | 668 | 215   | 161      | 1044   |
| Banabans       | 170 | 174   | 210      | 554    |
| Constabulary   | 57  | 35    | 23       | 115    |
| Warder and Wardress | 1   | 1     | 1        | 3      |
| Island Police  | 5   | 4     | 5        | 14     |
| Menial Staff   | 9   | 5     | 11       | 25     |

The Wireless Station at Ocean Island was opened for traffic on the 14th March, 1916. A public service via Suvaradio to all parts of the world was inaugurated on the 16th August, 1922. As a direct result of this a new and cheaper rate to Ocean Island from Australia via Rabaul came into operation on the 1st January, 1923.

Wireless communications with the Groups are maintained through the small station (½ K.W.) erected by Messrs. Burns, Philip & Co., Tarawa; the radio installation in the local trading vessel of Messrs. On Chong & Co., whose headquarters are at Butaritari, and the London Missionary Society’s ¼ K.W. Station at Beru. There is also an experimental Wireless Station at Vaitupu in the Ellice Group. The British Phosphate Commission has a ¼ K.W. Telephony Station at Ocean Island for communication with the island of Nauru, and their steamship “Nauru Chief.”

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE GROUPS.** — The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:— Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Kuria, Aranuka and Abemama (Northern Gilberts); Nonouti and Tabiteuea (Central Gilberts); Onotoa, Beru, Nukunau, Tamana and Arore (Southern Gilberts).

The Ellice Islands are the following nine:— Nanumea, Nanumaga, Nuiatua, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Nurakita.

The two groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 10° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude with an area of 180 square miles. The principal export is copra.

The population of the Gilbert Group at the end of December, 1928, was 24,930. Of these, 85 were Europeans, 31 Asiatics and 23,814 natives, of whom 11,575 were males.

The population of the Ellice Group at the end of December, 1928, was 3,863, 5 of whom were Europeans. The native male population numbered 1,718.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups. With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate. A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials. Revenue is obtained from a copra tax, trading and other licences, import and export duties, non-native capitation tax, etc.

**FANNING AND WASHINGTON ISLANDS** lie about 9° 51' N. latitude, and 169° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. A District Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 31. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the Colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel of the Fanning Island Company. The total population on the 30th June, 1927, was 450.

**CHRISTMAS ISLAND** (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell, and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. The population is 23. The port of entry for Christmas Island is Fanning Island, so that all inward entries and outward clearances must be made at the latter port.

Periodical visits are made by H.M.’s ships.

The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. There are no postal arrangements, the only mails that reach the island being carried by the ships chartered by the lessee in Tahiti.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Communication between the various islands is infrequent, depending on the irregular movements of vessels belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Burns, Philip and Company, Limited, On Chong and Company, and the British Phosphate Commissioners.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

| Year    | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|---------|-------------|

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ongtong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 150,000, but is about stationary now. Large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, estimated population 60,000. The natives have been described as treacherous, but of late years have shown themselves amenable to law and civilisation. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in December, 1927, amounted to 60,000 acres. The non-native population in 1914 numbered 660 Europeans, in 1919 numbered 675 Europeans and 75 Asiatics, in 1922, 493 Europeans and 90 Foreigners, in 1924, 338 Europeans and 100 Asiatics. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1883. The headquarters of the Protectorate is at Tulagi, a small island off Florida. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, Mala, Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal, Ysabel and Santa Cruz. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ontong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 150,000, but is about stationary now. Large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, estimated population 60,000. The natives have been described as treacherous, but of late years have shown themselves amenable to law and civilisation. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped, by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in December, 1927, amounted to 60,000 acres. The non-native population in 1914 numbered 660 Europeans, in 1919 numbered 675 Europeans and 75 Asiatics, in 1922, 493 Europeans and 90 Foreigners, in 1924, 338 Europeans and 100 Asiatics. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1883. The headquarters of the Protectorate is at Tulagi, a small island off Florida. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, Mala, Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal, Ysabel and Santa Cruz. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.
