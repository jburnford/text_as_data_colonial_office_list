NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitang River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of about 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 26' N. lat. The southern frontier was delimited in 1912-1913 by an Anglo-Dutch boundary commission, whose report was confirmed by a treaty at London on the 28th September, 1915.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The headquarters of administration are at present at Sandakan. Other stations are at Semporna, Lamag, Beluran, Kudat, Langkon, Rotabud, Tuaran, Jesselton, Panampang, Papar, Beaufort, Mempakul, Sipitang, Tenom, Keningau, Tambunan, Ranau, and Pensiangan.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The country is mountainous. The highest point is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who at the Census taken in 1921 numbered about 257,804, are mainly Brunais, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade. Further back, the Dusuns, the most numerous native race in North Borneo, cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields and in the uplands they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt. The Muruts, another interior tribe, are numerous; formerly they varied more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting but are
now peaceable. The Chinese population is steadily increasing and is now estimated to be not far short of 60,000; they form the trading, gardening and artisan section of the community. There is a State-aided scheme of Chinese immigration. Europeans number about 500. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of 12,000. There are several missions, including the Church of England, with stations at Sandakan, Kudat, and Jesselton, and the Roman Catholic with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast and eighteen schools in various parts of the country. The Church of England, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission has twelve schools, the principal ones being at Jesselton, Sandakan, Kudat, and Papar. Government maintains a training school at Jesselton for the sons of Native Chiefs and eight vernacular schools at other places.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1763, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive concessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a Company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (afterwards Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further concessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 150 inches, according to situation.

Annual Mean Temperature... 81 degrees

Industry.

The principal products of the country are estate rubber, timber, tobacco, coal, copra, and cutch. The last decade has witnessed a rapid expansion of the rubber industry; exports of rubber increased from 3,339 tons in 1919 to 7,381 tons in 1929. The vast timber resources of the country form one of its principal assets, but until recently only the fringe of the forests was being worked. A Company was however formed in 1920 for more adequate timber exploitation with modern lumbering apparatus. Timber is being exported in increasing quantities to China, Australia, and England; the exports in 1928 were valued at 291,045L At Sandakan two large steam driven sawmills have been working for some years and a modern band sawmill has been installed. An electrically driven sawmill was recently installed in Sandakan. Tobacco was formerly the principal article of export. Exports of tobacco were valued at 95,508L in 1929. Coal exports 1929, 53,772L The number of coconut plantations has rapidly increased, and exports of copra have risen considerably in value; exports of copra in 1929 were valued at 91,007L Cutch, a tanning material obtained from the bark of certain mangrove trees, is manufactured at Sandakan; exports in 1929, 32,069L Agriculture is now beyond the primitive state and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper, and tea. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, rotan, firewood, salt fish, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, etc., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself directly engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, excise, quit rents, licences, royalties, poll tax, and other usual sources of revenue.

Development.

Sandakan on the East and Jesselton on the West are the principal ports. Both towns have developed rapidly, and are now supplied with electric light and cold storage. Considerable sums have been spent by Government on reclamation, improvement of water supplies, etc., at both ports.

Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports. Sandakan is also rapidly becoming of importance as a coaling station for ocean liners. Gold in alluvial form is found in certain of the rivers on the East Coast.
Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. Indications of the presence of petroleum occur in many parts of the State, but so far it has not been found to exist in commercial quantity; prospecting work is still proceeding.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent, and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes. There is also a silver coin of 25 cents. A State Bank of North Borneo has been established with head office at Sandakan, and a branch office at Jesselton. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Bank of Taiwan.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are four Residencies, viz., the Sandakan and Kudat, West Coast, Tawau, and Interior Residencies.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based upon Indian law and the principal Indian Codes have been adopted in the State. Many enactments of the Straits Settlements also have been incorporated in local Ordinances. Courts of law are correlative to the Indian Courts under the Indian Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, while there are Imams' Courts for the administration of Moslem matrimonial law, and Native Courts to deal with matters of native custom.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every week between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, and a local company maintains a service along the coast and to the Philippine Islands. There is also regular steamship communication between the port of Tawau and ports in the Dutch East Indies. The State Railway on the West Coast, which is a metre gauge line, connects Jesselton with Beaufort, 57 miles distant. At Beaufort the line divides, one section proceeding to the port of Weston (20 miles), the other to Melalap in the interior (40 miles). In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 124 miles. At Jesselton there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. There is a first class metalled road 21 miles long, from Jesselton to Tuaran; another proceeds from Sandakan in a north-westerly direction, 13 miles of metalling have been completed and the road is being advanced by 2–3 miles annually. Road construction is being pushed forward in other localities of the State. There is a system of bridle-paths covering a total distance of 640 miles. Wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, Sebatik, Lahad Datu, and Lamag. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about thirty days.

Postage to all British possessions for letters 6 cents per oz.; foreign countries, 12 cents for the first oz., 6 cents each succeeding oz.

On the completion of the Singapore–Labuan–Hong Kong cable in 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, Sebatik, Lahad Datu, and Lamag. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan, and Kudat.
