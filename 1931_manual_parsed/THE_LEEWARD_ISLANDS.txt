*THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.
The Colony of the Leeward Islands, with a total area of 708 square miles, consists of a number of islands belonging partly to the chain of the Lesser Antilles; and partly (the Virgin Islands Group) to the eastern extremity of the Greater Antilles. The islands of Antigua, Barbuda, St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Montserrat form a fairly compact group between the 61st and 63rd degree of west longitude and around the 17th degree of north latitude; but Dominica lies about 100 miles to the south, separated by the French island of Guadeloupe from the rest of the Colony, while Anguilla, Sombrero, and still more the Virgins group (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, etc.), lie apart to the north and north-west.

St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat and Dominica form part of the volcanic chain of the Lesser Antilles, whilst Antigua and Barbuda form part of the eastern sedimentary series of the same chain.

Politically the Colony is divided into five Presidencies:—Antigua (with Barbuda), St. Christopher and Nevis (with Anguilla), Dominica, Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. These have been united and separated at various times in their history, and were finally federated in 1871 by Imperial Act 34 and 35 Vict., cap. 107. Sombrero was added to the Colony by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act on the 10th August, 1904, being attached to the Virgin Islands Presidency.

History.
The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica, they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Presidencies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.
The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry (except in Dominica) and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and

* For general map of the West Indies, see under Windward Islands.
Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to January.

**Constitution.**

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. The Legislative Council now consists of ten official and ten elected members. Three elected members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis, and one by those of the Legislative Council of Montserrat. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. As there is no Legislative Council in the Virgin Islands, one member is appointed by the Governor to represent that Presidency under "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871, Amendment Act, 1924." The official members are the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Federal Treasurer, the Administrators of St. Kitts-Nevis, and Dominica, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and such other person holding office under the Government of the Colony of the Leeward Islands as the Governor with the approval of the Secretary of State may appoint. *(Vide L. I. Act, No. 6 of 1923.)*

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

**Currency and Banking.**

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada have branches in Antigua, St. Kitts, and Dominica, and the latter bank has a branch in Montserrat. In Nevis and the Virgin Islands there are no banks.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

**Means of Communication.**

The following Steamship Lines serve the Colony:

- Canadian National Steamships from Canada and Bermuda call fortnightly at the chief ports in the Colony proceeding to Windward Islands, Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana.
- Furness-Bermuda Line (Br.), Ocean Dominion Line (U.S.) and Western Ocean Line (U.S.) about once every two weeks from New York and St. Thomas call at St. Kitts, Antigua and Dominica, proceeding to French West Indies, Windward Is., Barbados, Trinidad, etc.

A cargo steamer from London (Harrison Line) proceeds direct to Antigua and St. Kitts every two months, and a passenger ship of this line or of the Elders & Fyffes Line will call at Antigua sailing direct to or from England if a sufficient number of passengers offers, but this is usually only once a year in both directions. Normally, passengers travelling between England and the Leeward Islands travel direct between England and Barbados by the Elders & Fyffes Line, or Harrison Line, or the Royal Dutch West India Line, etc., and between Barbados and the Leeward Islands by Canadian National Steamships or by the Furness Bermuda Line.

Passengers may also travel to or from England via New York or Canada by the Lines mentioned, but in practice, the route via Barbados is usually adopted for passenger traffic for Europe.

An Air Mail service operated by Pan American Airways calls weekly at Antigua from Miami (U.S.A.) via Cuba, Haiti, Santo Domingo Porto Rico and St. Thomas, proceeding to St. Lucia, Trinidad, Georgetown (Br. Guiana) and Paramaribo (Dutch Guiana) and returns, also weekly, in the opposite direction.

**Posts and Telegraphs.**

Mails with Great Britain are exchanged via New York, and occasionally via Barbados, and direct with Canada, the United States and the British West Indies.

Mails are also exchanged by Air with the places served by the Pan American Airways, and with Great Britain via Trinidad and via Miami, U.S.A.

There are 49 Post Offices in the Colony and the rates of postage are as follows:

- **Inland.**—Letters, 1d. for the first 2 oz., ½d. per additional 2 oz.; Post cards, ½d.
- **British Empire, United States and Egypt.**—Letters, 1½d. for the first oz., 1d. per additional oz.; Post cards, 1d.
- **Other places.**—Letters, 2½d. for the first oz., 1½d. per additional oz.; Post cards, 1d.
All places.—Printed matter, ½d. per 2 oz.; "small packets," 6d. up to 8 oz.; 1½d. per additional oz.

Telephone Systems are maintained by the Government in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, and Montserrat.

Parcel Post.

Parcel post despatches are exchanged with Great Britain via Barbados, Canada and New York and direct with Canada, the United States and British West Indies, Bermuda, Br. Guiana, Guadeloupe and Dependencies and the Dutch West Indies and via London or New York to other countries.

British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid in the Colony and Money Orders are exchanged direct with Great Britain, Canada, the United States and British West Indian Colonies.

Telegraph communication is maintained by means of Wireless operated by Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., there being stations at Antigua, Dominica and St. Kitts, all of which communicate with one another and with Barbados for telegrams to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, etc. There is also a wireless station in Montserrat maintained by the Colonial Government but operated by the Company.

The principal tariffs are:

- To England 2½d. per word.
- To Eastern Canada 1½d. ...
- To Western Canada 1½d. ...

There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

There are cable stations at Antigua, Dominica and St. Kitts.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational in Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, the various denominations being Anglicans, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. In the other Presidencies elementary education is provided by the Government. On 31st March, 1936, there were 108 aided and Government schools in the Colony. The clergy of the various denominations are granted facilities for giving religious instruction during school hours to the children of their respective churches. During the financial year 1929-30 the Government grants to all the elementary schools in the Colony amounted to £18,389.

School fees have now been abolished in all public elementary schools throughout the colony. The schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. In the 108 aided and Government schools there were enrolled on 31st March, 1930, 25,611 children, with a daily average attendance of 17,082. For secondary education there are government grammar schools for boys in St. Kitts, Dominica and Montserrat, a private grammar school for boys in Antigua, private girls' high schools in Antigua and St. Kitts, and private mixed schools in Antigua, Nevis, St. Kitts (convent) and Dominica (convent).

The standard of the secondary schools is the Cambridge School Certificate.

There is a training college for female teachers in Antigua (under the control of the Moravian Church).

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45' and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 902) and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles, is very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces some salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing and horse rearing. Cotton is being grown with favourable results. Deer were introduced by the Codringtons. The island has communication with Antigua by a sailing-boat service. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N.lat., 61° 35' W.long., 1 mile by ½ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered in 1860, formerly worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license and subject to an annual rental of 50l.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663 Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. The island is in the main low-lying and has no forests. Rainfall:

| 1929 | 48°50     | 40°78               |

On the 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of
sixteen members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Governor presides. By Ordinance No. 7 of 1910, the duration of the Council is limited to three years.

The chief products are sugar and cotton. In 1928 16,480 acres were under sugar-cane, and 49,326 were uncultivated.

St. John, the chief town, has a population of 6,997, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1928, 24 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 439.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

This Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population on 31st December, 1929, was estimated at 35,365, as compared with 38,214 at the census of 1921. The total area is about 152 square miles.

Constitution and Government.

In 1625 Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas) Warne landed in St. Christopher, bearing a Royal Commission to the Earl of Carlisle, by which the islands of St. Christopher (or Merwar's Hope), Nevis, Barbados and Montserrat were taken under royal protection, and given over to his custody as the King's Lieutenant.

In 1671 St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla "and all other the Leeward Islands" were separated from Barbados and created the "Leeward Caribbee Islands Government," and Sir Charles Wheler was appointed "Captain-General" of the same. The chief seat of government was then at Nevis, but afterwards transferred to Antigua, and the government of each island, in the absence of the Captain-General, was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, or, when none such was appointed, by the President of the Council.

In 1689 Colonel Christopher Codrington was appointed Governor-in-Chief, and his Commission, granted by William III., and dated 20th October, 1689, authorised him to call assemblies of
fresholders and planters within any of the islands "jointly and severally to make laws for the public peace, welfare and good government of the said islands," thus providing for separate and federal legislatures. The Legislature in St. Christopher and in Nevis, as in the other islands of the government, consisted of two houses, a nominated Council and an elected Assembly, and had secured to it its own peculiar laws and local jurisdiction.

By Letters Patent, dated 26th April, 1816, the Commission originally granted to Sir William Stapleton was revoked, and the Leeward Caribbee Islands formed into two distinct governments, the first comprising Antigua, Montserrat and Barbuda, and the other St. Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd November, 1832, the General Government was restored, Dominica being for the first time included, and a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, with two Lieutenant-Governors for St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, and for Dominica respectively, were appointed, each island possessing a Legislative Council and House of Assembly, which continued, under the supervision of the Governor-in-Chief, to legislate for local interests.

In 1866 measures were introduced in each island to alter the constitution, and the two houses then existing were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of ex-officio members, nominees of the Crown, and representatives of the people elected under a limited franchise.

In 1878 the single chamber constitution was repealed in St. Kitts and in Nevis, and the Crown Colony form of government adopted in its stead, and in 1882 these two islands, with Anguilla, were united into one Presidency.

The office of Lieutenant-Governor, which existed until 1870, has been abolished, and the Presidency, in the absence therefrom of the Governor, is under the immediate supervision of an Administrator.

There is one Executive Council for the Presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, certain ex-officio members, and such other persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint. The Legislative Council consists of seven official and seven nominated unofficial members, besides the Governor and the Administrator. Of the unofficial members not more than six shall be from among the people of St. Kitts and Anguilla, and one at least from among the people of Nevis. The Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator, or, in the absence of both of them, a member of the Council appointed in writing, presides, and the President of the Council enjoys an original and a casting vote. The Council meets at the town of Basseterre in St. Kitts.

Industry.

Sugar is the principal crop in St. Kitts (150,937 tons of cane in 1930 crop, from 6,883 acres). It is grown in the Basseterre Valley and on the lower slopes round the island (the northern side showing the best average yield), and the cane is crushed and sugar produced at a central factory a mile from Basseterre. A light railway for haulage of canes encircles the island. The sugar industry is at present suffering severe depression.

The only other important crop in St. Kitts is cotton, the lint produced in 1929 being 327,299 lbs. on 1,400 acres (for the whole Presidency 756,115 lbs. on 2,964 acres), but efforts are being made to encourage the growing of tomatoes and other vegetables for export.

Cotton (406,916 lbs. lint in 1929 from 1,500 acres) and coconuts are the chief products exported from Nevis, but the latter crop has suffered severely from the effects of the 1928 hurricane.

Vegetables and cattle, chiefly for export to St. Kitts and for local consumption, are also produced in Nevis.

Salt is the chief product of Anguilla, and is also produced from ponds at the "tail" of St. Kitts, the combined quantity in 1929 being 1276 barrels.

Anguilla also produced, in 1929, 21,900 lbs. cotton on 64 acres.

There are no manufacturing industries (other than the manufacture of sugar) in the Presidency.

Education.

There are four secondary schools:—a Government grammar school for boys in St. Kitts, a girls' high school in St. Kitts and a mixed school in Nevis, both state-aided, and a convent school.

There are 31 Government primary schools (16 in St. Kitts, including 4 in Basseterre, 10 in Nevis and 5 in Anguilla) and also a Roman Catholic school and a few small private schools.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. A branch of this range encloses the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the principal town, with a population of about 8,000. Near the town of Sandy Point is Brimstone Hill, strongly fortified and fiercely besieged during the French wars. It is quite isolated, and about 750 feet in height.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasture, while their summits are crowned with dense wood. The island is of volcanic formation, and the soil, save in the mountains (where it is clayey) is peculiarly light and porous, sandy yet fertile.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 76°.

The average rainfall in St. Kitts for the year 1928 was 52'53 inches.

St. Christopher or St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Liamuiga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies, the settlement having been founded by Mr. Thomas Warner and other settlers, who landed on the 28th January, 1623, at the present village of
Old Road. Later, French settlements were formed at the two ends of the island. The whole island was finally assigned to England under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 40' N. lat., and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, has a population of about 1,100. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 15,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The soil is very different from that of St. Kitts, being of stiff clay, encumbered everywhere with volcanic boulders.

There are hot mineral springs adjoining the Bath House Hotel near Charlestown. These springs have valuable medicinal properties.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitts, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Kitts) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about twelve miles.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is situated in 18° 12' N. lat., and 63° 5' W. long., about 60 miles N.W. of St. Kitts, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

Unlike the mountainous volcanic islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla consists of Oligocene limestone and clay and its highest point is 213 ft. above sea level.

The inhabitants are peasant proprietors under the jurisdiction of a medical officer who is also magistrate.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply.

Besides cattle, ponies and small stock, the chief product is salt. Sea Island cotton is cultivated.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 304½ square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £2,092. 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of 15,000l. by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the Maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is good and the climate healthy. Limes and cocoa flourish throughout the coastal zone. The former, however, are being rapidly wiped out by root disease, but this critical situation is being combated by planting limes budded on resistant stocks on a considerable scale. The higher slopes in the centre of the island are well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, nutmegs, spices and such tropical fruits that require humid conditions.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the
roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Lime-juice, cocoas, coconuts, copra, and fruit (including green limes, grapefruit and oranges) are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, has now ceased to be made. A considerable trade is carried on also in spices, oils, and timber, 1929: cocoas, 3,999l.; essential oils, 80,588l.; vanilla, 730l.; limes and lime juice (limes, 23,065l.; Con. lime juice, 8,122l.; R. lime juice, 47,609l.) 78,696l.; coconuts, 199l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1929 was 96'98 inches; the average for the whole island was 129'67 inches; the mean temperature 78'60 Fahr. (Roseau).

The chief town is Roseau, with a population of 6,803 according to the census of April, 1921: it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1929, 13 vessels, of a total tonnage of 197 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1915.

There is a Government telephone system of 542 miles, with 7 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 8 members. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abolishing itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. A Legislative council was created, consisting of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. Ordinance No. 21 of 1924, provides for the election of four of the unofficial members of the council. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide C. D. 1298, 1902).

According to the Census of 1921 there are about 420 Caribs in the Island, of whom about 141 are estimated as of pure blood.

Montserrat.

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32½ square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Chance's Mtn. (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,730, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1927, 4 sailing vessels, total tonnage 134 tons net.

Montserrat was colonised by the Irish in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1783.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. In 1861, these were replaced by a single Chamber of eight elected and four nominated members.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, this Chamber was replaced by a Legislative Council of not more than six nominated members. By Act No. 2, of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, the number of members was limited to four. Ordinance No. 4 of 1909 repealed No. 2 of 1902 and limited the tenure of office of the members of the Council to three years. Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number of members to six. Ordinance No. 18 of 1922 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number to eight. Unofficial representation on the General Legislative Council of the L.I. has now been provided for.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, has declined, and onions and cotton are now the principal products. The lime cultivation, which was considerably extended recently, has suffered a severe set back by the hurricane of 12th-13th September, 1928, but is being rehabilitated.

The cultivation of Sea Island cotton, which was once grown during the American Civil War, was re-introduced in 1901, and, where the lands are suitable, has superseded the sugar industry.

There is a small industry in producing tomatoes for supply in winter to Canada. In the 1929 season 4,500 crates were shipped having a gross value of £2,000.

Among the other exports may be mentioned a drug known as "papain," essential oils, lime juice, cotton-seed oil, cattle and green vegetables.

There are eight Anglican schools with 1,592 scholars, three Wesleyan with 813, one Roman Catholic with 303, and one undenominational with 251 scholars.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a hurricane; and again on 28th August, 1924, and 13th September, 1928.

There is telephonic communication throughout the Island; a Wireless Station was erected in 1925.

The island is considered to be one of the most healthy of the Antilles. Death-rate 1929, 17·7 per 1,000. Birth-rate 1929, 34·9 per 1,000.

The rainfall in 1929 averaged 53·06 in 10 stations; and the mean temperature was 78°4.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to eastward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dykes, Peter Island, Salt Island, and all others not in the possession of the United States of America. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. A lighthouse is maintained by the Board of Trade on Sombrero, which was first included in the Colony in 1904.

The Americans possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the Constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members, to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government. This Ordinance was repealed May 1st, 1902, since when the Governor of the Leeward Islands ordains the laws. There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Road Town, Tortola, population (1921) 437, which is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1929, 6 vessels, registered total tonnage, 58.

The cultivation of sea island cotton, once the principal industry of the Virgin Islands, was abandoned in consequence of the destruction wrought by the Pink Boll Worm, but is now being revived. A tobacco industry has been started, and cigars are manufactured for export. Attempts are being made to establish other industries. The land is admirably adapted for the growth of coconuts, sugar-cane, tobacco, sisal, etc.

A small quantity of sugar is made for local consumption, also rum.
During the years 1914 and 1915, the planting of coconuts by the Government Experiment Station and by proprietors of land in the Virgin Islands received much attention. Considerable damage was done to the coconut cultivation by the hurricane in 1924, but measures for its re-establishment have been taken by the Agricultural Department. A large area of land in the Virgin Islands is well adapted to coconut cultivation, and the existing trees are quite free from any serious insect or fungoid pests.

The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy, intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Virgin Islands of the U.S., and to a smaller extent with Hayti and San Domingo.

The currency consists almost entirely of foreign money, which circulates at the following rates of exchange: Danish money at 25 francs to £1., American money at $6 to £1.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great. The average annual rainfall at Road Town is about 54 inches.

The birth and death rates per 1,000 in 1929 were 26·37 and 10·11 respectively.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (agaves and bromelias) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is weekly by Government motor launch to St. Thomas. Mails are also despatched to St. Thomas nearly every day, letters for Europe being usually sent via Porto Rico and New York weekly.
