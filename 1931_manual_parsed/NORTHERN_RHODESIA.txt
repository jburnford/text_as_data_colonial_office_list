NORTHERN RHODESIA.

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the Territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the North of British Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the South African Republic, and to the West of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about 287,960 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine Provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Livingstone, situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls. Other important settlements are at Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Lusaka, Mazabuka, Ndola near which the copper mines of Bwana Mkuubwa, Nchanga, Nkana, Roan Antelope, and Mufuli are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, and Mongu-Lealui in Barotseland.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer, with whose advent the authentic history of Northern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at the Zambesi near the place where the town bearing his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1883, twenty years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the North but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyassa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to the East coast via Lake Nyassa) was released at Fort ameson, which had just been established, in 1898. An account of the early operations of the British South Africa Company under the Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be found under the section relating to Southern Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia. Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed the first Administrator of the combined territory, and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa, and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey ordered a general advance into German East Africa of the troops under his command, and by July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy. Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbeck doubled southwards, and on the 1st November made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier station, Fife. From there they proceeded southwest to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies.
for the forces operating on the border. The bulk of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the first news of the enemy's advance. After burning most of the buildings and their remaining contents, Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu motor-road, and early on the 13th November his advanced parties opened fire on the British South Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chambesi River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice was received by the District Commissioner and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted the position and suspended hostilities. The number of individual Rhodesians (men and women) known to have undertaken duties in connection with the war was 7,009. Of these 6,859 served with H.M. Forces during the war, 459 being from Northern Rhodesia. 791 were killed in action or died of wounds or disease.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He relinquished office on the 20th September, 1923, and was succeeded by Mr. (now Sir Richard) Goode, C.M.G., C.B.E., as Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 26th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and seven unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H. J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

He was succeeded in 1927 by Sir James Crawford Maxwell, K.C.M.G., K.B.E., M.D.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as Native Authorities and Courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse Province is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied. The courts presided over by District Officers have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from District Officers, Courts to Provincial Commissioners' Courts, and from Provincial Commissioners' Courts to the High Court.

### Population

| Year | European | Native |
|------|----------|--------|
|      | Male     | Female | Total | Male | Female | Total |
| 1911 | 1,121    | 376    | 1,497 | —    | —      | 531,362 |
| 1921 | 2,263    | 1,371  | 3,634 | 447,841 | 532,066 | 979,906 |

The European population at the 31st December, 1929 was computed as 9,981. The native population was estimated to be 1,298,661.

### Education

- **Europeans.**—For the education of European children there were in 1930 Government Schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lusaka, Broken Hill, and Fort Jameson. At all of these, with the exception of the school at Fort Jameson, primary education up to Standard VII was given, with the additional subjects, Latin, French, Algebra in Standards VI and VII, and Geometry in Standard VII. At Fort Jameson primary education was given up to Standard V. Nine "B" Schools were open during the year at Silver Rest, Chilongoalo, Lubombo, Bwana Mukubwa, Luanshya, Ndola, Nkana, Mufulira and Nchanga in all of which education was given up to Standard V.

- **The Beit School** at Choma provided a separate boarding school for girls, while the Codrington School, Mazabuka, accommodated boys only as boarders.

- **Native.**—The Department of Native Education supervises the educational work of the Missionary Societies working in the Territory, and apportions the grants in aid of the Mission Schools which conform to the Government syllabus and requirements. There is an Advisory Board on Native Education upon which Missions, Settlers and Government Departments are represented. A Government School for the training of "Jeans" Teachers and Agricultural Demonstrators was opened at Mazabuka in
1930, connected with the Central Research Station. The Barotse National School is also a Government Institution.

Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° to 90° with a maximum of 103° and a minimum of 56°. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 68° to 75° with a maximum of 86° and a minimum of 40°. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of 120°, whilst minima round about 30° are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70% to 90% of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again. The average rainfall so far as present investigations shew is 34.18 inches per annum.

Commerce and Industry.

Agriculture.

By far the greater portion of the Territory may be said to be undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in the matter of its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little or no general trade in food commodities other than in a purely local sense. The staple native cereals are finger-millet (Eleusine coracana), kaffir-corn (Sorghum) and Maize. The former is produced over large tracts of the Territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby one grain crop is grown in rotation with forest re-growths which may occupy the land for from fifteen years to upwards of sixty years or more in the less favoured places. In this system the gardens revert to bush after each grain crop. Other native crops are bulrush millet (Pennisetum typhoidesm), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes, and a great variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption only and a small localized trade. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the Territory but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Marosi, Baila, and to a less extent the Angoni in North-Eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the Territory are impassable to animal transport owing to the presence of tse-tse fly. In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

The cattle industry may be said to be in a satisfactory position but mainly owing to a shortage of breeding stock and the recent sudden enormous increase in consumption occasioned by the mining activities in the north, the local demands cannot be met from supplies within the Territory. The farming and ranching areas are singularly free from serious cattle diseases.

Maize is the chief crop and the demand for this from the mines is steadily increasing. Owing to increased competition from imported grain, however, local prices of this commodity have declined somewhat recently.

The cultivation of cotton received a severe check some years ago due largely to the widespread damage caused by the Cotton Jassid and the susceptibility to this pest of the varieties then grown. The resistant strains evolved at the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation Experimental Station, Barberton, have recently been introduced and have been found to be quite satisfactory from the point of view of immunity to this pest. The severity of the attack of other insects remains, however, a limiting factor in cotton production, and these are under investigation both from the standpoint of the plant-breeder and the entomologist. It is yet too early to make any statement as to the future of cotton as a commercial crop.

The glut in the tobacco market, caused by over-production of Empire leaf, has caused no small amount of embarrassment to planters. When market conditions have again become stabilised there would appear to be no reason why tobacco should not once more take its place as one of the most valuable and important crops. The amount of wheat produced is still far below local requirements. The establishment of a Co-operative Wheat Mill in the wheat area has made it possible for the crop to be converted into flour after a minimum amount of transport. The mill can deal with far greater quantities than it receives at present. Formerly, all wheat grown had to be exported to Southern Rhodesia for milling. Other crops are, groundnuts, beans, potatoes, and, to a smaller extent, citrus. The requirements of the Territory are still greater than the supply of the majority of the crops grown, and an increase in the acreage of these and other crops for human consumption is obviously indicated. The increased population, resulting from the activities in connection with mining development, has caused a very much increased demand for foodstuffs of all varieties.

The dairy industry is small but is making steady progress. There is scope for greater increase in the production of dairy produce, as the Territory produces under a quarter of the requirements of the local demand and of those of the Belgian Congo. The balance is imported from the south.

The ranching industry is of considerable importance but it is quite incapable of supplying the demands made upon it. As a consequence, many thousands of cattle pass through Northern Rhodesia from Southern Rhodesia and N'Gamiland each year to supply the markets of the Belgian Congo. The estimated requirements of Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo for slaughter cattle are 50,000 head per annum.

The Central Research Station, which is situated about three miles from Mazabuks on the railway line in the centre of the farming areas, was opened on the 2nd November, 1929. This Station, which is a joint Agricultural and Veterinary one, is staffed and equipped to deal with general agricultural investigations of local economic importance on the one hand and on the other with specific researches designed to lead to the control of animal diseases of economic importance in the Territory. Joint investigations having as their object the improvement of the general standard of animal husbandry in the Territory are also proceeding.

Two agricultural sub-stations are in process of formation, one at Fort Jameson and the other at Abercorn. These sub-stations, which will be under the supervision of the District Agricultural Officers now stationed at these points, in addition to the conduct of investigations of purely local significance in
their respective districts, will undertake the testing out of the local application of results obtained in the more detailed investigations carried out at the Central Station and will constitute centres for the dissemination of agricultural information and instruction in the areas which they serve. It may confidently be expected that the combined work of these Stations will be of considerable aid to agriculture generally in the Territory in which hitherto no facilities have existed for accurate investigation of any of the many problems which confront the local agriculturist.

The Jeanes School at Mazabuka, in the vicinity of the Central Research Station, provides agricultural training for selected natives who will subsequently be employed, under technical direction, as agricultural demonstrators in the native areas.

Forestry.

Preliminary investigations in connection with the establishment of a Forest Department have been commenced by a forest officer appointed to the Territory. More than 60 per cent. of the entire area of Northern Rhodesia is estimated, at present, to be more or less covered with trees and shrubs, but the forest growth, chiefly of the Savannah Woodland type, is undergoing considerable modification in composition and area as a result of native shifting cultivation and annual fires. It is proposed to maintain certain areas as protection forests for the prevention of soil erosion and the preservation of water supplies in springs and rivers. Further areas are to be dedicated to the production of timber of the more useful indigenous species. The aerial survey at present being carried out over part of the Territory will greatly accelerate the demarcation of Forest Reserves in that region. Experimental plantations of fast-growing exotic tree species are being established and private enterprise in this direction has already commenced in the mining areas.

The only commercial timber industry in the Territory at present is that of the Zambesi Saw Mills Ltd., whose operations extend from Livingstone to the Machili River under concessions granted by the Government. This Company is chiefly concerned with the extraction, by light railway, of timbers of the Kalahari sand belt type, including Mkushi, Baikiaea plurijuga; Mukwa, Pterocarpus angolensis; Mwangura, Pterocarpus stevensoni; Mupumena, Estandophragma sp.; Mkamba, Afzelia guanzensis; Mugongo, Ricinodendron rautanenii; and Musheshe, Burkea africana. The Company has contracts for supplying sleepers to the South African and Rhodesian Railways.

Land Settlement.

An Agricultural Survey Commission has been appointed for the purpose of reporting upon the unalienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European settlement, and this Commission will advise as to what class of farming or ranching the land is suitable.

Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Department of Mines.

The outstanding mining developments of the year 1929 have been:

(a) The discoveries of large areas of copper-bearing deposits in the Nkana Concession Area, resulting in the registration of 22 new copper properties.

(b) The diamond drilling results on the Nkana Mine areas has proved that the copper sulphides extend to the westward and the tonnage of copper likely to be produced has been at least doubled.

(c) The preparations for producing copper on the Roan Antelope Mine is progressing steadily and two other areas have been included in the holdings of the mine, namely, Roan Extension and Muliaashi, which have at least doubled the size of the property.

(d) The copper deposit at Mutufira has been thoroughly prospected by diamond drills and this large mine, with exceptional widths of copper-bearing sediments, is being brought to the producing stage.

(e) The Nchanga Mine area has discovered a further extension of high-grade copper deposits in its area.

(f) The Broken Hill Zinc Mine is producing both Zino and Vanadium.

The number of natives employed on the mines is now over 22,000, and will greatly increase as the mines expand.

During 1929 699 ozs. of gold, 2,248 ozs. of silver, 5,465 tons of copper, 1,635 tons of lead, 5,919 lbs. of mica, 131,290 lbs. of vanadium, 1,349 tons of manganese ore, and 3,556 tons of iron ore, were produced.

Imports and Exports.

| Year | Exports (£) | Imports (£) |
|------|------------|------------|
| 1924 | 465,917    | 684,183    |
| 1925 | 432,997    | 1,317,907  |
| 1926 | 490,382    | 1,725,682  |
| 1927 | 777,890    | 2,030,599  |
| 1928 | 860,704    | 2,422,341  |
| 1929 | 926,823    | 3,669,648  |

Included in the exports for the year 1929 were:

- Animals (living) 8,928l.; Hides, Skins and Horns, 39,165l.; Ivory, 8,922l.; Butter, 561l.; Wheat, 13,853l.; Maize, including other cereals in the grain, 25,567l.; Maize Meal, 17,781l.; Pulse, 1,040l.; Tobacco (unmanufactured) 70,310l.; Copper Ore and Concentrates, 6,018l.; Copper Bar and Ingots, 230,688l.; Lead, 37,729l.; Vanadium, 16,394l.; Other Ores, 34,904l.; Zinc, 262,611l.; Gold, 3,441l.; Lime, 940l.; Wood (manufactured and partly manufactured), 20,316l.

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have been constructed from Ndola to Luanhsya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nkana, a distance of approximately 45 miles, and from Mokambo (in the Belgian Congo) to Mutufira, a distance of approximately 9 miles.

Legislation was passed in 1929 for the extension of the Ndola-Nkana railway to Nchanga, and construction of the line is in progress. When completed the Ndola-Nkana-Nchanga railway will be approximately 85 miles long.

Consideration is being given by a private company to the construction of a short connecting link, which has already been surveyed between Kansanshi Mine...
and the Katanga Railway which will bring that mine into more direct communication with the port of Lobito and, it is estimated, will save about 14 days in shipment of freights to and from Europe.

A survey is also being made of a direct connection to Kansanshi from the Benguela Railway at a point in Portuguese West Africa.

Road communications are being opened up, and dry season motor tracks are now in use from Victoria Falls (via Livingstone, Lusaka and Broken Hill) to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge (790 miles approx.) ; Broken Hill to Abercorn (604 miles), and thence via Mwenzo, on the border of Northern Rhodesia, to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony; this portion forming part of the Cape to Cairo Route. Lusaka and Fort Jameson are also connected by road, a distance of 375 miles, and a road, leaving the Great North Road about 45 miles north of Broken Hill, runs through the Mining Areas via Ndola, Nchanga, Solwezi, Kasempa, and Mumbwa to rejoin the Great North Road at Chisamba.

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aerodromes suitable for large aircraft are situated at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Ndola, Mpika, and Abercorn. Re-fuelling facilities are already available at the first three and will be available at Mpika early in 1931. Aerodromes suitable for smaller aircraft exist at Mazabuka, Solwezi, Kasempa, Fort Jameson, and Mongu. Emergency landing grounds are being prepared and will be available by the beginning of 1931 at Isoka, Chinsali, Serenje and Mtuga.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyassaland. There are 41 post offices in the Territory, 15 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyassaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the Territory is 2,450 miles.

### Finance

| Year       | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 1924–1925  | £309,795| £340,327    |
| 1925–1926  | £371,046| £394,336    |

The foregoing figures do not include expenditure amounting to £125,822 incurred between the years 1926 and 1930 for development purposes in anticipation of the receipt of Loan Funds.

An income tax was first imposed in Northern Rhodesia in 1921. The rates of tax now in force are:

- For each pound of the first 100l. of the chargeable amount: 1s. 6d.
- Next 100l.: 1s. 6d.
- 100l.: 2s. 6d.
- 100l.: 2s. 6d.
- In excess of 500l.: 3s. 6d.

Before arriving at the chargeable amount the following deductions are allowed:

(i) Ten per cent. of earned income subject to a maximum deduction of 200l.
(ii) Personal, 300l.
(iii) For wife, 600l.
(iv) For children—90l. for first child, other children 60l. each. Age limit 18.

(v) For Insurance, &c.—One-sixth of chargeable income before making deductions for insurance and deductions under (iii) and (iv) above, and (vi) below.

(vi) For dependant, 50l.

The tax upon the chargeable income of a Company is at the rate of 3s. on every pound thereof.

There are branches of the Standard Bank of South Africa at Livingstone and Lusaka and an Agency at Mazabuka and branches of Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) at Broken Hill and Fort Jameson, and an Agency at Bwana M'Kubwa.

This Company is chiefly concerned with the extraction, by light railway, of timbers of the Kalahari sand belt type, including Mukushi, Batikasa plurijuga; Mukwa, Pterocarpus angolensis; Mwangura, Pterocarpus stevensonii; Mapumena, Entandrophragma ep.; Mkamba, Afzelia quanzensis; Mugongo, Ricinodendron rudolfianum; and Musheche, Burkea africana. The Company has contracts for supplying sleepers to the South African and Rhodesian Railways.

Land Settlement.

An Agricultural Survey Commission has been appointed for the purpose of reporting upon the unalienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European settlement, and this Commission will advise as to what class of farming or ranching the land is suitable.

Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 15s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

Department of Mines.

The outstanding mining developments of the year 1929 have been:

(a) The discoveries of large areas of copper-bearing deposits in the Nkana Concession Area, resulting in the registration of 22 new copper properties.

(b) The diamond drilling results on the Nkana Mine areas has proved that the copper sulphides extend to the westward and the tonnage of copper likely to be produced has been at least doubled.

(c) The preparations for producing copper on the Roan Antelope Mine is progressing steadily and two other areas have been included in the holdings of the mine, namely, Roan Extension and Mulashi, which have at least doubled the size of the property.

(d) The copper deposit at Muflira has been thoroughly prospected by diamond drills and this large mine, with exceptional widths of copper-bearing sediments, is being brought to the producing stage.

(e) The Nchanga Mine area has discovered a further extension of high-grade copper deposits in its area.

(f) The Broken Hill Zinc Mine is producing both Zinc and Vanadium.

The number of natives employed on the mines is now over 22,000, and will greatly increase as the mines expand.

During 1929 699 ozs. of gold, 2,248 ozs. of silver, 5,465 tons of copper, 1,635 tons of lead, 5,919 lbs. of mica, 131,290 lbs. of vanadium, 1,849 tons of manganese ore, and 3,556 tons of iron ore, were produced.

Imports and Exports.

| Year | Expo ts. | Impts. |
|------|----------|--------|
| 1924 | 455,917  | 684,183|
| 1925 | 432,997  | 1,317,907|

| 1927 | 777,890  | 2,030,599|
| 1928 | 860,704  | 2,422,841|
| 1929 | 926,823  | 3,669,648|

Included in the exports for the year 1929 were:

Animals (living), 8,922l.; Hides, Skins and Horns, 39,165l.; Ivory, 8,922l.; Butter, 561l.; Wheat, 13,856l.; Maize, including other cereals in the grain, 25,687l.; Maize Meal, 17,781l.; Pulse, 1,040l.; Tobacco (unmanufactured) 70,310l.; Copper Ore and Concentrates, 6,018l.; Copper Bar and Ingots, 230,698l.; Lead, 37,729l.; Vanadium, 16,389l.; Other Ores, 34,904l.; Zinc, 282,611l.; Gold, 3,441l.; Lime, 940l.; Wood (manufactured and partly manufactured), 20,316l.

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nkana, a distance of approximately 45 miles, and from Mokambo (in the Belgian Congo) to Mufulira, a distance of approximately 9 miles.

Legislation was passed in 1929 for the extension of the Ndola-Nkana railway to Nchanga, and construction of the line is in progress. When completed the Ndola-Nkana-Nchanga railway will be approximately 85 miles long.

Consideration is being given by a private company to the construction of a short connecting link, which has already been surveyed between Kansanshi Mine...
and the Kntanga Railway which will bring that mine into more direct communication with the port of Lobito and, it is estimated, will save about 14 days in shipment of freights to and from Europe.

A survey is also being made of a direct connection to Kansanshi from the Benguela Railway at a point in Portuguese West Africa.

Road communications are being opened up, and dry season motor tracks are now in use from Victoria Falls (via Livingstone, Luasa and Broken Hill) to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge (790 miles approx.) ; Broken Hill to Abercorn (604 miles), and thence via Mwenzu, on the border of Northern Rhodesia, to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony; this portion forming part of the Cape to Cairo Route. Luasa and Fort Jameson are also connected by road, a distance of 375 miles, and a road, leaving the Great North Road about 45 miles north of Broken Hill, runs through the Mining Areas via Ndola, Nchanga, Solwezi, Kasempa, and Mumbwa to rejoin the Great North Road at Chisamba.

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aerodromes suitable for large aircraft are situated at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Ndola, Mpika, and Abercorn. Re-fuelling facilities are already available at the first three and will be available at Mpika early in 1931. Aerodromes suitable for smaller aircraft exist at Mazabuka, Solwezi, Kasempa, Fort Jameson, and Mongu. Emergency landing grounds are being prepared and will be available by the beginning of 1931 at Isoka, Chinsali, Serenje and Mtuga.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyasaland. There are 41 post offices in the Territory, 18 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the Territory is 2,450 miles.
