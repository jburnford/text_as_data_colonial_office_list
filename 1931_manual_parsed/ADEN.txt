ADEN.

The peninsula of Aden is situated in lat. 12° 47' N. and long. 45° 10' E., about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, on the Arabian coast. The Settlement (the total area of which, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles) consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas:—Aden proper (area 21 square miles; population 43,106), on the south, and Little Aden (area 15 square miles; population 565), on the west—and a flat strip of coast, about three miles broad and known as Shalk Othman (area 39 square miles; population 10,764). The peninsulas form the horns of a bay called Aden Back Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. The native town of Aden is situated on the east of the Aden peninsula, opposite a gap in the crater walls. On the west side of the peninsula, some five miles from the town, is Steamer Point, off which the large steamers lie. The highest point of the peninsula is 1,776 feet above sea level. The average annual rainfall is about 3 inches, and the maximum is about 8 inches. The climate is very hot and damp, especially during the summer months. The Aden Protectorate, to the north and north-east of Aden, has an area of about 9,000 square miles and a population of over 100,000. Aden is an important bunkering station, and also an entrepot for the trade with Arabia. The exports
consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc. The Settlement forms part of British India, and is subject to the Government of Bombay, and administered by a Resident, and Commander-in-Chief who is assisted by two officers of the Government of India, Political Department, one Protectorate Secretary, selected by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a Judicial officer from the Indian Civil Service, and an officer of the Public Works Department as Chairman of the Aden Settlement and Port Trust. The Police are under the control of an officer of the Indian Police Service.

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1838 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1851 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1860. The Aden peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1888 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchases in 1882 and 1888.

As from 1st April, 1927, the responsibility for military affairs in Aden and for the affairs of the Protectorate was transferred to the Colonial Office, the settlement itself remaining part of British India.

**Perim**, a bare rocky island, five square miles in area, with a population of about 2,000, lies in the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, about 1½ miles from the south-west corner of Arabia. It possesses a good harbour on the south-west side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth. It was occupied by the British in 1799, but subsequently abandoned, and was only re-occupied in 1887, when the overland route to India made the position important. It is a coaling and cable station, and forms part of the Settlement of Aden.

**Socotra**, an island situated about 150 miles E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui, in 12° 19′—12° 42′ N. lat., and 55° 21′—53° 30′ E. long, and lying in the direct route to India, has been since 1876 under the Government of Aden, which pays a small subsidy to the Sultan of Keshin, to whom it belonged. It is famous for its aloes. The population of the island is about 12,000. It is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous. It was formally placed under British protection by agreement with the Sultan in October, 1886, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kute and Bromers Islands.

**TRISTAN DA CUNHA.**

Tristan da Cunha is the principal of a group of islands lying in lat. 37° 6′ S. long., 12° 2′ W., about midway between South Africa and South America. It is an extinct volcano rising to 7,640 feet above sea level, with a crater-lake near its summit. It was taken possession of by a military force during the residence of Napoleon at St. Helena. When the garrison was withdrawn in 1817, William Glass, a corporal of artillery, and his wife elected to remain, and they were joined by two ex-Navy men, Alexander Cotton and John Mooney, and these, with certain ship-wrecked sailors, became the founders of the present settlement, which is on the north-west of the island, where there is a comparatively level area about 9 miles long and 1½ miles broad and about 100 feet above the sea. After some years, the five unmarried settlers contracted with a sea captain to bring them wives from St. Helena. The population numbers about 130.

The inhabitants are spoken of as long-lived, healthy, moral, religious, and hospitable to strangers. A supply of stores and provisions was provided out of a grant voted by Parliament, and sent out by a man-of-war in 1886, nearly all the able-bodied men having been drowned while attempting to board a vessel in December, 1885.

In the way of live stock, the inhabitants have between them about 220 head of cattle, about 700 sheep, about 50 pigs, and an abundance of poultry. Potatoes do well, and a good crop is got annually. Apple trees are in fair number, and bear well; there are also a few fig trees, but they do not fruit. The tree of the island, which apparently is a juniper, and upon which the islanders are dependent for their wood for fuel, is getting scarce in the neighbourhood of the settlement, but is abundant further off, and there is no fear of supply failing.

The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel has from time to time maintained a clergyman in the island.

In January, 1904, the island was visited by H.M.S. "Odin" in order to ascertain whether the islanders would accept the offer of the Cape Government to settle them in the Cape Colony, but out of eleven families only three families elected to go. The islanders are liable from time to time to privations. In March, 1907, owing to information indicating probability of failure of supplies, relief was sent by His Majesty's Government by the "Greyhound," chartered at Cape Town. On this occasion also the inhabitants were unwilling to leave the island, and the Rev. J. G. Barrow, a clergyman who had gone to the island in April, 1906, reported that though there is sure to be privation from time to time, it does not cause absolute distress. (See correspondence presented to Parliament in Cd. 3098 and Cd. 3764.)

Arrangements are usually made for the island to be visited by a ship at least once a year.

January, February, and March are the best months for visiting the island. It is in these months that weather at times becomes so settled that the islanders are able to make visits to inaccessible and Nightingale Islands, which are some 20 miles off. They also are often able to visit these islands in November.
MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS.

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Many of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for coconut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island and Cato Island (in the Norfolk Island Group), Sombrero (West Indies, with a Board of Trade Lighthouse costing £20 annually) Raine Island, Bell Cay and Bramble Cay (near British New Guinea), Caroline Island, Flint Island and Vostoc Island, (Pacific Ocean, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat., and 151° 48' W. long.), Malden Island (4° 1' S. lat., 156° 57' W. long.), leased to Messrs. Grice, Sumner, and Co., and Starbuck Island; also Gough, Nightingale and Inaccessible Islands (in the S. Atlantic), and there are many others.

The Great and Little Bases and Minicoy are small islets in the Indian Ocean, with lighthouses maintained by the Board of Trade out of shipping dues levied on vessels passing, and collected at Ceylon, Mauritius, Straits, and Indian ports.

The Kuria-Muria Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable.

Amboyne Cay and Sprattley Island (lat. 8° 38' N., 111° 54' E. long.; lat. 7° 52' N., 112° 55' E. long.), two uninhabited sandbanks in the middle of the China Sea, lying about 240 miles N.W. of Borneo and 100 miles N. of Labuan, were annexed in 1877, and leased for guano collection. They are annually visited by Chinese junks for the purpose of collecting turtle.
