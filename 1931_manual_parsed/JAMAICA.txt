JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 42' 20" and 18° 32' 30", and W. long. 76° 11' 56" and 78° 23' 35". It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,460 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,388 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the south-west, and the Rio Grande in the north-east. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 62,707 in 1921, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 83' and 81° 30' W. long, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, are dependencies of Jamaica,† as are also Pedro and Morant Cays (two guano islands in 17° N. lat.).

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,848,160 acres, from which may be deducted 80,000 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,768,160 acres available for cultivation. Of this 828,064 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1929-30.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, the Governor of Hispaniola. It was raided by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596-7, and by Colonel Jackson in 1643, but it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force, sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II., who appointed General Edward Doyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. Part of this town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston which then consisted of a few sheds, soon rose into a place of importance. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves. These consisted primarily of the slaves the Spaniards left, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains, but before long runaway slaves from English masters took refuge in the mountains of the centre of the island and were only subjugated in 1738, when both classes of maroons were settled in five reserves under their own leaders, and henceforth gave little trouble except for a partial rising in 1796, which was soon suppressed, the prisoners taken being sent to Sierra Leone. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A rebellion among the coloured population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1907, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of 150,000l. was voted by Parliament, and a loan of 800,000l., chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°7', rising to 87°6' in the day time, and falling to 71°0' in the early morning. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° lower in temperature can be attained by a ride of one hour by motor car.

The rainy seasons occur generally over the whole island in May and June and again in September, October and November; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by occasional showers; and in the N.E. portion of the island there is usually a rainy season at the end of the year, and light rains generally during the month of August. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches...
to as much as 187 inches at Fellowship and 222 inches at Moore Town, both on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain Range. And the 50-year average is 76 inches.

Regions of the island are visited by storms of hurricane force about 14 times in a century and disastrous earthquakes occurred in 1692 and 1907.

Under two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, somewhat over three-fourths being pure negroes. There are about 18,000 East Indians and about 3,700 Chinese (in 1921). English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a nominated Council, and an elected Assembly which on its first meeting in 1664, consisted of 30 members but which fluctuated in numbers from time to time. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored. A separate Privy Council was set up and an Executive Committee was established. The latter was to act as a sort of Cabinet, especially as regards financial matters.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature responded by abrogating all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

Accordingly a Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex-officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons as may be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty, but the number of members is not to exceed eight. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

A special feature of this constitution is that nine elected members can carry any financial measure, while the unanimous vote of the whole fourteen elected members on other matters cannot be overridden by the other votes unless the governor declares that such a decision is of paramount importance in the public interest.

Administration.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties, an excise duty on rum, and stamp and licence duties. A tax of 1s. (in Kingston 8d.) on every £10 of the gross value of property is levied.

There is a Supreme Court of Judicature together with Resident Magistrate Courts and Petty Sessions of Justices of the Peace throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of Petty Sessions.

An "Island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the Parochial Boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision.

There is a Corporation of the amalgamated parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew with a Mayor, Council and Corporate officers.

In the 13 other parishes there are elective Parochial Boards under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, water-works, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population, in 1921, 62,707), Port Royal (population 1,004), Spanish Town (population 6,694), Port Antonio (population 6,272), Montego Bay (population 6,580), Falmouth (population 2,136), Port Maria (population 2,481), and Savanna la Mar (population 3,442).

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1929-30 was 345,286l.; their expenditure 353,893l. Their debt at the end of the year was 1,063,597l.

Currency and Banking.

British currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 200,000l. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada and the Canadian Bank of Commerce are the only private banking establishments in the Colony. Barclays Bank has one branch and 9 sub-branches; it had an average weekly note circulation in 1929 of 121,884l. The
Bank of Nova Scotia has 12 branches and 1 sub-branch, and had an average note circulation in 1929 of 106,673l. The Royal Bank of Canada has two branches and had an average note circulation in 1929 of 29,621l. The Canadian Bank of Commerce has a branch in Kingston, and had an average note circulation in 1929 of 8,065l. Approximately 200,000l. of British currency notes formerly in circulation have been withdrawn and are being replaced by Bank of England Notes, in denominations of 10s. and £1. British silver coins of and above the denomination of 6d. are legal tender to any extent; coins below the denomination of 6d. are legal tender to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Under Law 27 of 1904, local Currency Notes, which are made legal tender under section 5, have been issued to the extent of 121,500l., in denominations of 2s. 6d., 5s. and 10s.; 2s. 6d. notes, 31,250l.; 5s. notes, 106,250l.; 10s. notes, 75,000l. Estimated amount of local currency notes in circulation on 31st March, 1930, was 81,701l. 2s. 6d. The 2s. 6d. notes have been recalled and nearly all are withdrawn from circulation.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent., and in 1897 to 2½ per cent. In 1917 the rate of interest was again increased to 3 per cent. There are 99 branches now operating. The total deposits on 31st December, 1929, was 612,842l.

Co-Operative Loan Banks.

There are now 53 Loan Banks on the Register of Industrial and Provident Societies. Of these, 36 have obtained loans from the Agricultural Loan Societies Board appointed under Law 6 of 1912, "A Law for the encouragement of Agricultural Loan Societies."

The following is a summary of these transactions to 31st December, 1929:

| Loans made under Law 6 of 1912 | 48,091l. 9s. 0d. |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| " " " " Hurricane or Special Loan Laws | 80,489l. 12s. 4d. |

Of this amount, 113,663l. 13s. 10d. has been repaid, leaving 14,912l. 7s. 6d. outstanding.

The 44 Banks from which returns were obtained also collected to 31st December, 1926, the sum of over 35,289l. share capital. These figures may be taken as an indication that the work of the Loan Banks has been successfully carried on and that they are likely to prove a permanent benefit to Small Holders and Peasant Proprietors. Some of these Banks have extended their sphere of usefulness by taking advantage of the Land Settlement Scheme, whereby Government moneys are lent for the purchase of properties for the purpose of re-sale in lots to small settlers. 59,641l. 3s. 11d. has been loaned to nine Banks, under this head, and 38,045l. 0s. 9d. repaid. The scheme has been well received, and its extension in the future seems certain.

Education.

Elementary education is provided for from public funds and, during recent years, 135 Government (undenominational) elementary schools have been established. The number of recognised elementary schools is 656, with 69,800 scholars in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1929 was £146,977; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for women teachers which is mainly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Moio undenominational training college for men, and two denominational colleges for women teachers. By a law passed in 1892 a Board of Education was constituted. The District School Boards manage the Government schools, some of which are held in Government buildings, others in rented buildings.

The Government maintains a Technical Continuation and Commercial School in Kingston and awards scholarships for trade instruction and apprenticeship. Two Continuation Schools for Girls are aided from public funds.

Provision was made in 1892 for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are nineteen secondary schools receiving aid from public funds under regulations for grants in aid. Secondary education is provided for in general by endowed schools, under local governing bodies controlled by the Jamaica Schools Commission, and a number of private schools. There are three scholarships (one for girls) tenable at English universities or elsewhere within the British Empire and one scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad. One Rhodes Scholarship is annually awarded in Jamaica. The following examinations are held:—London University, Cambridge Locals, Oxford and Cambridge Joint Board, Associated Board of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music, Royal Drawing Society.

In the Institute of Jamaica (in Kingston) is a Public Library with 28,000 books, of which 7,000 form a West India Reference Library; a Natural History Museum, with a small collection of live animals; and a Jamaica History Gallery.

Industry.

Fruit is the largest export, 22,047,536 stems of bananas of a value of £2,509,878 being exported in 1929, in which year citrus fruits (grape fruits and oranges) valued at £64,338 were also exported. Other exports were as under:

The Island's import trade is divided as follows:

- United States of America: 31.0 per cent
- United Kingdom: 26.3 "
- Canada: 18.0 "
- Other Countries: 24.7 "

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica via the United States. Messrs. Elder's and Fyffe's and the Jamaica Dried-Fruit Line furnish frequent and regular Services for passengers and freight. The voyage takes 13 to 14 days. The Leyland Line steamers (West India and Pacific Branch) leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica. The Canadian National Steamships also furnish regular Services to Canada and the other West Indian Islands.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. The two cables from Cuba touch at Jamaica, from which they branch away via St. Thomas to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

Telegraph lines connect all the principal towns, and there are 160 telegraph and telephone stations. The total mileage open is 1,713. 1,064 miles along roads, 172 miles P.O. lines on railway, and 217 along railway lines. The receipts in 1929 were 20,147l.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of St. James, a distance of 112 miles 60 chains, and to Port Antonio, in the parish of Portland, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 63 miles; and to Ewarton, by a branch line from Bog Walk, on the Port Antonio branch, of 8 miles 40 chains, and by a branch line from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; also from Linestead to New Works, 2 miles 40 chains. The total length of line open is 210 miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge for 1929-30, providing for interest and repayment, is 187,684l. The receipts in 1929-30 were more than the expenditure by 49,399l., leaving a deficiency of 138,284l. There is also a line of telegraph and telephone along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 1124 miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17¾ miles; from Bog Walk to Port Antonio, 54¼ miles; from May Pen to Frankfield, 23 miles; and from Linestead to New Works, 2¾ miles.

The island is intersected by an extensive system of tar-treated and metallised roads, suitable for motoring, the highest one passes over a gap at an elevation of a little over 4,000 feet. Owing to the configuration of the island there are many bridges and culverts and sharp turns; the maximum grades are generally 1 in 15. There are 2,309 miles of main roads, and about 4,368 miles of parochial roads.

A coastal service is run by the United Fruit Co., the Royal Mail Co. and the Webster Co. with motor vessels and sailing vessels whenever cargo is available.

The United Fruit Co., the Royal Mail Co., Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Co., the Jamaica Direct Line, Atlantic Fruit Co. and Leyland Line maintain a weekly steamship service and also call at outports when necessary.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth and St. Ann's Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st December, 1928, no ships were built.

CAYMAN ISLANDS.

The Cayman Islands (a dependency of Jamaica) with an area of 104 square miles and a population (in 1921) of 5,223, consist of three islands, Grand Cayman (85 square miles), Little Cayman (9 square miles), and Cayman Brac (10 square miles), lying between 79° 33' and 81° 30' W. longitude, and 19° 16' and 19° 46' N. latitude. They were discovered by Columbus, on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession of them soon after the conquest of Jamaica, and they were mainly colonised from that island.

Grand Cayman is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, and varies from 4 to 7 miles in breadth. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized harbours. One on the north side of the island, called the Great Sound, measures over six miles across.

The principal industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle. These turtles are brought to the island and placed in "kraals," to recover and fatten before being sent to their next stage, Key West, United States. Over 2,000 turtles a year are thus disposed of at an average price of £2 each.

The Island of Grand Cayman is in some parts fruitful, and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honey-combed limestone, and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found in quantities. Phosphate deposits of some value exist, and were worked, but have lately been neglected.

There are two towns, Georgetown and Bodden-town, and several villages. The population of Grand Cayman numbered 3,945 at the census of 1921.

The smaller Cayman Islands, viz., Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are about 70 miles distant from Grand Cayman; they are almost entirely given up to the growth of cocoanut. Their inhabitants numbered at the last reckoning 95 and 1,213 persons respectively.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is much larger than in most parts of the West Indies.

Fine schooners of native woods are constructed at these islands for sale and for local use, the people being first-rate shipwrights.

The Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands consists of the Justices of the Peace and elected Vestrymen, and the laws passed by this body are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming operative.

The government of the Dependency is administered by a Commissioner.

TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is about 166 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 64 miles long and 1½ miles broad. According to the census of 1921 Grand Turk contains 1,668 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population which in 1921 was 5,612. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

Grand Turk claims to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas. In 1873 they were annexed to Jamaica and still remain one of its dependencies.

Two hurricanes passed over these Islands in 1928, on July 24th and September 16th respectively, and did great damage. The second one was the most disastrous, as regards damage to property, in the history of the Dependency.

Another hurricane passed over these Islands on September 14th, 1928, which did considerable damage and caused the loss of 17 lives.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the average quantity annually gathered being about 1,600,000 bushels, equal to 56,000 tons. 1,712,270 bushels were exported in 1929 valued at £36,875. Sponges are found on the Caicos Bank, and there is a sponge-curing establishment at Cockburn Harbour, South Caicos. The export of sponge in 1929, 22,547 lbs., was valued at £2,135L. 1,349,800 dried conchs (shell fish), valued at £1,360L. Cotton and Cotton Seed valued at £331L., were shipped in 1929.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. Commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st Dec., 1929, 44 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 960 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the constant sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 78°, the extreme range being from 60° to 93°. The rainfall at Grand Turk during 1929 amounted to 27'61 inches, the average rainfall during the five years 1925-1929 was 28'36 inches.

Means of Communication.

There is a mail, passenger, and freight service between New York and Grand Turk every three weeks by steamers of the Porto Rico Line.

Steamers of the Royal Netherlands West India Mail, trading between New York and South America, call at Grand Turk about twice a month for stevedores and call again on the return voyage to land them. These ships bring mails and passengers from New York but no cargo.

The Elders and Fyffes Line make occasional calls on their way to Jamaica when passengers offer and on such occasions take mails to Jamaica.

There is a telephone exchange at Grand Turk with 60 connections.

The rate of letter postage is 2d. per ounce to all British Possessions; 2½d. to the U.S.A., and to all other countries 3d. per ounce.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1888, the station being at Grand Turk. The rates are per word: To England 2s. 4d., to Jamaica 1s., to Halifax 1s. 6d.

A new cable was laid in 1924 connecting Grand Turk with Barbados.

Communication between Grand Turk and Salt Cay in the Turks Islands and Cockburn Harbour has been established by wireless telephone. The station at Grand Turk is also a telegraphic one with a sending range of about 500 miles.

Education.

In 1921 a secondary school was opened at Grand Turk and controlled by a Board of Management appointed by the Commissioner. This school receives an annual government grant of 150L., and other revenue is derived from school fees.

There are ten elementary schools supported by Government, with 824 pupils enrolled in 1929 and an average attendance of 586. The schools are entirely unsectarian and free.

During 1924 a Centre for the Cambridge Local Examinations was established at Grand Turk.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of five shillings, ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1929, 932 depositors, with 16,909L. deposits.

Constitution.

By Jamaica Law No. 6 of 1926 which came into operation on the 1st day of August 1926, the
Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner, who by virtue of his office is President, and seven other persons, three of whom are holders of offices under the Crown, appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.

KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coast line from Umba River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000£ per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into ten Provinces.

1. The Nyanza Province comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu, Londiani.
2. The Nzoia Province comprising the districts of Nandi, Uasin Gishu, Elgeyo, Marakwet and Trans Nzoia.
3. The Turkana Province comprising the districts of North and South Turkana and West Suk.
4. The Rift Valley Province comprising the districts of Nakuru, Ravine and Baringo.
5. The Naivasha Province comprising the districts of Naivasha and Leikipia.
6. The Masai Province comprising the districts of Narok and Kajiado.
7. The Kikuyu Province comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kyambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, North Nyeri, Embu and Meru.
8. The Ukamba Province comprising the districts of Machakos, Kitui and Teita.
9. The Coast Province comprising the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu.
10. The Northern Frontier Province comprising the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir and Telengger.

The Capital of the Colony is Nairobi, which is also the largest centre in the Colony. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1929 | 4,411      |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 50,000, of whom about 1,200 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours, Mombasa harbour on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A Municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928. Kilindini is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply and a scheme for improved harbour facilities is being carried out. Four deep water berths have been constructed and a fifth is nearing completion.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by shallow draught steamers.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 3,003,158. A census of the non-native population taken in February, 1928, showed a European population of 12,629 and an Asiatic population of 41,140. Estimates compiled at the end of 1929 give the following figures:

| Race   | Population |
|--------|------------|
| Africans | 2,930,604 |
| Indians | 35,514    |
| Europeans | 16,683   |
| Arabs   | 12,504    |
| Goans   | 3,990     |
| Others  | 3,883     |
| Total   | 3,003,158 |

On the coast the Arabs and Swahili predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkana, the Massai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 11th September, 1920, as amended by Additional Instructions dated the 7th July, 1928, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Chief Native Commissioner, Commissioner for Local...
Government, Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the African community. Under royal instructions dated the 28th March, 1927, it was provided that if at any time the number of Indian elected members is less than five the vacancy or vacancies so arising might be filled by the appointment of nominated Indian unofficial members. The ex officio members are to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate forms one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

Climate.

For purposes of rainfall Kenya may be divided into three parts:

1. Northern Desert area where there is usually less than 20 inches a year.
2. The coastal strip and the Nyanza and Kikuyu Provinces where there may be from 40 to 80 inches a year, and
3. The remainder of Kenya where rainfall is from 20 to 40 inches a year. On the Coast there is usually a single rainy season from April to November, but up-country there are generally "long" rains from April to June, and "short" rains from October to December. The Coastal regions have a tropical climate though nights are cool except during the hottest months from December to April. In the Highlands the climate is invigorating with cool breezes; at Nairobi the mean maximum shade temperature in 1928 was 80.4° F., and the mean minimum 54.5° F. The rainfall at Nairobi was 29.22 inches.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 15. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at Is. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d. It was then decided to fix the rate in the East Africa Protectorate, the Uganda Protectorate, and the Tanganyika Territory at 2s. sterling to the rupee, and to issue a new currency in local rupee coin and notes, but subsequently it was decided that the new coinage should be expressed in terms of florins, instead of rupees, the 50 cent piece being alternatively termed a shilling. Some rupee notes were introduced but no rupee coins. Later the shilling was made the standard coin instead of the florin, and arrangements were made to withdraw from circulation the Indian rupee, which was demonetised from July, 1921. The nickel-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a rupee) have been withdrawn from circulation, and new copper-bronze coins (1, 5 and 10 cents of a shilling) have been introduced.

The old Local Board of Currency Commissioners has been abolished, and the Currency of the Colony and Protectorate is now in the hands of the East Africa Currency Board in London, represented locally by the Treasurer.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office:—26, Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Eldoret, and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd. (Head Office:—10, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) have branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Manyuki, Kitale in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with which is amalgamated The National Bank of South Africa Ltd., has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale and Eldoret, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Land and Products.

As elevations within the Colony range from sea level to 9,000 feet and more, conditions of temperature are most varied, and tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate crops are grown.

In order of their importance, the Agricultural products of the lowlands are maize, coconuts, sisal, cotton, sugar-cane and the miscellaneous native grains and oil seeds. The output of cotton shows a steady increase.

In the highlands, coffee, maize, sisal and wheat are the premier crops, and an increasing export in these is noteworthy. The acreage under sugar-cane is extending, while wattle, barley, potatoes, vegetables, fruit and a large variety of crops of minor importance are grown on an increasing scale.

Extensive pasture grounds exist throughout the highlands, and maintain considerable herds of grade and native stock. The value of exports of hides and skins is considerable, and the dairy industry under European supervision is in a thriving condition, producing a steadily increasing surplus of butter for export.
The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as Podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

The mineral resources of the Colony are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; good quality mica has been discovered in the Suk district; mica diatomite and graphite are found in Ukambani; limestone is worked near Kajiado, Kitui, Makindu, and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukambani and a gypsum deposit has been discovered near Simba; gold prospecting activities exist south of Kiati. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1929, was 6,812,800 acres, of which 6,296,619 acres were leasehold. In addition, there are 360,960 acres of Township and Government Reserves. Sale of leases of land by public auction has been resumed.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1917 Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

Up to 1921 an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. was in force for practically all imports other than spirits, and certain articles for industrial, agricultural, stock breeding, railway and other services were admitted free of duty.

The principal export duties were derived from:

(a) a specific tax ranging between 2 and 2½ shillings on birds and animals.

(b) an ad valorem tax ranging between 4% and 30% on borites (mangrove poles), chillies, ebony, gum copal, hides, horns, ivory, rubber, sea shells and hippopotamus teeth.

Legislation enacted in 1921-3, terminating with the Kenya and Uganda Customs Tariff Ordinance of the 31st December, 1923, introduced many important changes, the most notable being:

(a) a uniform Tariff for Kenya and Uganda which operates also in Tanganyika Territory.

(b) free trade between Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika Territory in goods the growth, produce or manufacture of each of the Territories.

(c) specific duties on certain classes of imports generally ranging between 10% and 50% of their value.

(d) ad valorem duties ranging between 10% and 30% and assessed on the value of the goods at the port of shipment plus the cost of packing, loading freight, insurance, landing, and all other charges up to the time of deposit of the goods in Customs premises at the port of importation.

(e) thorough revision of the free list which while generally maintaining previous exemptions added passenger's personal and used household effects, disinfectants, surgical instruments, mining materials, school stationery and similar requisites, etc.

(f) entire abolition of export duties.

In the case of Kenya only a consumption tax was placed on wines and spirits in 1928.

The Customs Management Laws of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika Territory were co-ordinated in 1928 and culminated in the application of the Customs Management Ordinance, 1926, on the 1st June, 1927. By agreement between the Governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika Territory, the previous free interchange of local produce and manufactures was extended with effect from the 1st August, 1927, by the introduction of a system of free interchange of imported goods. Under this procedure, which is operated by means of transfer forms, single payment of duty only is chargeable, the Customs revenue involved being credited to the consuming territory by inter-departmental entry.

During January and February, 1930, an examination of the Customs Tariff Ordinance, 1923, was undertaken and the Customs Tariff Ordinance, 1930, was enacted in Kenya and Uganda and Tanganyika Territory with effect from the 17th April, 1930.

The import tariff as it now stands admits free of duty goods essential to the agricultural, industrial, educational, and scientific development of the territories and has been designed, as far as possible, to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika Territory, taken as an economic unit, are, or can be made, self-supporting.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value in pounds sterling of Trade Imports (excluding imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign), and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports were as follows:

| Year | Trade Imports | Total Customs Receipts | Tonnage Entered |

Government, Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, the Director of Agriculture, and Director of Education (ex officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the African community.

Under royal instructions dated the 28th March, 1927, it was provided that if at any time the number of Indian elected members is less than five the vacancy or vacancies so arising might be filled by the appointment of nominated Indian unofficial members. The ex officio members are to be the ex officio members of the Executive Council, with the General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi; and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

By local ordinance in January, 1924, provision was made for the election of the Indian and Arab members. The Indian franchise (like the European franchise) is adult (over 21) suffrage and the whole Colony and Protectorate forms one five-member constituency. The Arab franchise is adult (over 21) male suffrage subject to ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters. Here too the whole country forms one constituency.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

Climate.

For purposes of rainfall Kenya may be divided into three parts:

1. Northern Desert area where there is usually less than 20 inches a year.
2. The coastal strip and the Nyanza and Kikuyu Provinces where there may be from 40 to 80 inches a year, and
3. The remainder of Kenya where rainfall is from 20 to 40 inches a year. On the Coast there is usually a single rainy season from April to November, but up-country there are generally "long" rains from April to June, and "short" rains from October to December. The Coastal regions have a tropical climate though nights are cool except during the hottest months from December to April. In the Highlands the climate is invigorating with cool breezes; at Nairobi the mean maximum shade temperature in 1928 was 80.4° F., and the mean minimum 54.5° F. The rainfall at Nairobi was 29.22 inches.

Currency and Banks.

The currency originally consisted of the Indian rupee as the standard coin, with smaller local coins and notes of higher denominations, all expressed in terms of the rupee; the British sovereign was also legal tender at Rs. 16. The exchange value of the rupee, after being maintained for many years by the Government of India at Is. 4d., began to rise in 1917 and early in 1920 reached 2s. 9d.

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co., Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw Bros., and the Compagnia Italiana Transatlantica.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by a Central Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Colony (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda.

It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway.

The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches, open to traffic at the end of 1930, was 1,506 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings. The following branches and extensions were under construction:—

Naro Moru-Nanyuki extension, 17½ miles.
The Yala branch, 32½ miles.
Jinja-Kampala extension (main line), 57-88 miles.

The Railway marine consists of the Lake Victoria, the Lake Kioga, the Lake Albert and Nile flotillas. Their respective strengths are as follows:—

Lake Victoria, 5 passenger cargo steamers, total displacement tonnage 5,346.
4 tugs and one launch.
38 steel lighters of total capacity 5,830 tons.

Lake Kioga, 3 Sternwheel steamers.
18 lighters, total capacity 1,930 tons.

Lake Albert, 3 steamers and 4 lighters.

Building for Lake Albert, 1 twin screw passenger cargo steamer of 700 tons displacement.
The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda:

Total expenditure on capital at end of 1929: £19,493,324.
Revenue for 1929: £2,448,960.
Ordinary Working Expenditure, excluding loan and redemption charges, for 1929: £1,445,070.
Passengers carried: No. 1,161,770.
Goods carried (revenue earning): tons 1,106,302.
Total steamer mileages, all three services: 212,778.

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the Port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now almost entirely used by dhows. Kilindini Harbour has been the scene of intensive development during the last eight years, and some 34 million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lighterage quay and cranes, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 3,000 feet with five transit sheds, three of which are double storey. Each berth is served by five electric quay cranes. The total number of electric, quay, shed and stacking ground cranes being 66 up to date. A Harbour Advisory Board advises the High Commissioner for Transport on Port Matters.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The Post Office of the Colony (exclusive of Uganda, which is worked by the Kenya Post Office) received and despatched during 1929, 13,475,260 letters, packets, etc., and 638,906 telegrams.

The Telegraph and Telephone system has 10,998 miles of wire (exclusive of Uganda). The lines connect Mombasa with Lamu and Witu (184 miles), Mombasa with Gazi and Tanganyika Border (61 miles), Mombasa with Nairobi (330 miles), Voi with Kahe (92 miles), Konza with Lake Magadi (91 miles), Konza with Machakos (22 miles), Nairobi with Nyeri, Nanyuki, Meru and Isiolo (263 miles), Nairobi with Nakuru (123 miles), Kijabe with Narok (61 miles), Gilgil with Rumuruti (79 miles), Nakuru with Kisumu (136 miles), Kisumu to Uganda Border (75 miles), Lumbwa with Kericho and Chemagel (51 miles), Muhoroni with Songhor (10 miles), Kibigori with Eldoret (49 miles), Nakuru with Eldama Ravine and Eldoret (128 miles), Rongai with Lake Solai (27 miles), Eldoret with Kitale and Endebess (64 miles), Eldoret with Moiben (28 miles), Eldoret to Uganda Border (97 miles). Lines follow all Railway Lines including Branch Lines. Communication between Mombasa and Ships at Sea, Italian Somaliland and with Zanzibar (for Government traffic only) is maintained by means of radio-telegraphy. A cable connects Mombasa with Zanzibar.

Telegraph communication exists with Uganda and Tanganyika Territory. The Kenya telegraph system is also linked up via the Tanganyika Territory, Nyasaland and Rhodesian systems with the South African service. Communication with the Belgian Congo is maintained through Uganda with whom the Belgian Congo system is linked up.

Telephone Exchanges are worked at Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Kitale, Kiambu, Koru, Ruiru, Kabete, Molo, Thika, Kericho, Chemagel, Njoro and Turbo. There is telephone communication between Mombasa and Tanganyika Territory. 2,096 telephones were in use in Kenya at the end of 1929.

Aviation.

Preliminary survey flights between Kisumu and Khartum, the cost borne in part by the Kenya, Uganda and Sudan Governments, were started by Captain T. A. Gladstone in February, 1927, with a view to deciding the feasibility of an air mail service on that route.

These preliminary flights were completed by Sir Alan Cobham on behalf of the North Sea Aerial and General Transport Company Limited in 1928 and in the same year proposals for a subsidy were made by the Cobham-Blackburn Air Lines Limited. These proposals were considered by the representatives of the Kenya, Uganda and Sudan Governments, the Air Ministry and the Company at a meeting in Nairobi in 1928 at which the Imperial importance of linking London with Cape Town was stressed. An arrangement has now been made between Imperial Airways Limited and the Cobham-Blackburn Air Lines Limited and negotiations were in progress in 1930 between His Majesty's Government, the aviation interests concerned and the participating Governments with a view to extending the proposed Alexandria-Mwanza Air Service to Cape Town.

East Africa Governors' Conference.

In pursuance of a recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission which visited E. Africa in 1924, a first Conference of Governors of the British East African Dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1926, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was then decided that a permanent Secretariat for the Conference should be established at Nairobi and conferences held as and when necessary. The cost of the Secretariat is contributed in varying proportions by the East African Governments and by the Kenya and Uganda Railway Administration. The Secretary of the Conference is Colonel C. W. G. Walker, D.S.O., who is also Secretary to the High Commissioner for Transport, Kenya and Uganda. Salary £1,500.
