ST. HELENA.

Situation, Area, &c.
St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 700 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of Africa, in 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad, covering an area of 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres (a little larger than Jersey). The distance from Southampton is 4,477 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from England, 17 days, and from Capetown, 6 days.

A census taken in April, 1921, showed a population of 3,747, of whom 49 were members of the Garrison, and 32 East African deportees.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of 1,500. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer in Jamestown ranging in summer between 68° and 84°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The country is 10° colder. The rainfall for the years 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929, was 35'13", 30'16", 31'57", 23'31" and 30 inches respectively. The island is very healthy. The death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants was for 1926, 12'16"; for 1926, 17'97"; for 1927, 16'78", and for 1928 was 18'17". The death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants for 1929 was 10'4"; and the birth-rate 31'46".

History.
St. Helena, then uninhabited and well wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was visited by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. They built a church there, but made no permanent settlement. The Dutch held it from 1645 to 1650, when they abandoned it. It was taken possession of by the East India Company in 1651, and a charter for its administration was granted in 1661. In 1685 it was seized by the Dutch, who were, however, expelled the same year. Again, in January, 1673, they seized it, to be driven out finally in May, by Captain Munden, of the English Navy. A new charter was issued by Charles II. to the East India Company for its possession in December, 1673, and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was brought under the direct government of the Crown by an Act of Parliament of 1833.

Education and Local Government.
The Government maintain 3 schools, having 284 scholars. There are also 5 endowed and private day schools, two of which are aided by Government, having 306 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 11 of 1903, and fees of ld. a week per child are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1927 were 1,009l. and 978l., for 1928 was 916l. 6s. 8d. and 916l. 4s. 4½d., and for the year 1929 was 963l. 9s. 7d. and 943l. 9s. Od. respectively.

Industry.
St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for about 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the Red Sea route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron. As early as 1818 a law was passed that all future children born in the Island should be free.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, except flax fibre (phormium tenax). The company which started this industry failed from bad management in transporting the green leaves to town for treatment. For every 100 tons so transported at a heavy cost the yield was only about three tons of fibre, though, under present conditions of working, ten tons of phormium...
leaves give one ton of fibre and a quarter ton of tow. The industry was re-started with the help of a grant from the Home Exchequer. The Government Mill opened in 1907, but was closed down in May, 1910, on exhaustion of millable leaf. It was re-opened on 13th November, 1911, and still continues to run; but Government has handed over control to a Limited Liability Company.

There are now nine mills operating in the Island, the amount of fibre and tow exported in 1929 being 889 and 505 tons respectively. A rope and twine industry was also established in 1926, the amount of rope and twine exported during 1929 was 51 tons.

In 1928 the land under cultivation of Flax was estimated at 2,000 acres.

A lace-making industry was established in August, 1907, with the help of a grant from Imperial funds.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies, including steamers and ships of war was 35 in 1929. It is a port of registry.

The chief industries are phormium fibre, lace-making, aloe and bead work, fishing and agriculture, the main arable crop being phormium tenax.

The Government savings bank was established in 1865 (the amount standing to the credit of depositors on 31st December, 1929, was 17,369L 19s. 8d.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England at par.

There are excellent facilities for the supply of coal and water to ships.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England at regular intervals of 4 weeks, and proceed to Cape and Natal, steamers arrive from thence at the same interval and proceed to England. The interval between the arrival and departure of the mails is 6 days. The rate of postage to the U.K., India, and British Possessions is 2d. for the first oz. and 1½d. for each additional ounce; to other parts of the world 3d. for the first oz. and 1½d. for each additional ounce. There is no internal post, but there are 41 miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 400L. The cable from the Cape (which is being worked by the Eastern Telegraph Company with a staff of 13, including a Superintendent) reached St. Helena at the end of 1899, and was carried forward to Ascension by February, 1900. It is completed to St. Vincent.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council, but power is reserved to legislate by Order of His Majesty in Council.

The island of Ascension, 34 square miles in area, lying in the South Atlantic, lat. 7° 53' S. and long. 14° 18' W., was taken possession of in 1815, and, until 1922, it was under the supervision of the Admiralty and a small naval station was maintained there.

By Letters Patent dated 12th September, 1922, it was made a Dependency of St. Helena and placed under the control of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

It is famous for its turtles, large numbers of which are caught between December and May. It is connected by telegraph with St. Vincent, St. Helena, and Sierra Leone, and is an important cable station of the Eastern Telegraph Company. It is a barren, rocky peak of purely volcanic origin, and destitute of vegetation, except at the highest point, 2,870 feet high, but has been cultivated to an extent permitting the maintenance of about 600 sheep and cattle.

Total population on 31st December, 1929, was 220, of whom 145 were St. Helenians.
