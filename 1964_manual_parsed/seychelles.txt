SEYCHELLES

Area

Its land area is approximately 100 square miles, exclusive of Aldabra Lagoon estimated to cover about 55 square miles.

Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad and is estimated to cover 55½ square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtvil, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.

Population

The population at mid-year 1962 was estimated to be 43,750.

Principal Town

Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 10,500.

Geographical Features

The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over seventeen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate

In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70-135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the past 58 years is 91·38 inches and the mean temperature was 76·5°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.

History

The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May 1794 when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Ile de France. Scychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for seventeen and the British for sixteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.
Constitution

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. Under a 1960 Order in Council the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, four *ex officio* members, five elected and three nominated members of whom at least one must be an unofficial. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, four *ex officio* members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. This is chargeable on all earned or investment income arising in or derived from the Territory. In addition tax is payable by residents on investment income arising out of the Colony or on earned income remitted thereto, the basis of assessment being income arising in the calendar year preceding year of assessment.

Rates of tax, after deduction of allowances, are:

- 5% on first Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 12½% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 25% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 30% on next Rs. 5,000 of chargeable income
- 40% on next Rs. 10,000 of chargeable income
- 50% on next Rs. 20,000 of chargeable income
- 60% on any excess over Rs. 50,000.

No tax is charged where the total income does not exceed Rs. 2,400. Companies, partnerships, etc., pay a flat rate of 35%.

Allowances are made to resident taxpayers:

- Earned income .. 1/10th (max. Rs. 1,500).
- Personal (single) .. Rs. 2,000.
- Personal (married) .. Rs. 3,500.
- Children .. Rs. 500 (max. Rs. 2,500).

Additional allowance of Rs. 1,000 may be claimed for child over 11 years studying abroad.

Dependent relative .. Rs. 500 (limited to one relative) if relative is infirm, maintained by claimant and not in receipt of an income exceeding Rs. 500.

In addition, allowances may be claimed in respect of life insurance, superannuation, alimony and deductions against plant and machinery owned and operated by the assessee.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue Rs. | Expenditure Rs. |

The grant-in-aid to this Colony for 1962 was estimated at Rs. 1,063,827, but is not expected to exceed Rs. 335,000, a decline partly due to unusual stamp revenue.

Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Notes of 1 rupee and 50 cents are however being gradually withdrawn from circulation. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d.

Libraries

Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust and there are small libraries run by the Co-operation Book Society, the Roman Catholic Mission and the Alliance Française.

Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has very few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent and filariasis is infrequent. The incidence of leprosy however is still significant, while amoebiasis and other intestinal infestations such as ancylostomiasis, giardiasis and balantidium coli dysenteries are extremely common. The programme for improving sanitation in Victoria inaugurated some three years ago has come virtually to a standstill.

During 1961 the World Health Organisation carried out a survey of the incidence of tuberculosis on the Island of Mahe after which a "Follow Up" operation was to be conducted by the Colony's Medical Department.

The position when the "Follow Up" began may be summarised thus:

(i) The number of tuberculosis patients already on the T.B. Register and still alive before the influx of cases discovered by W.H.O. was 269.

(ii) The number of cases referred by W.H.O. was:

(a) Suspect active tuberculosis . . . 408
(b) Suspect inactive tuberculosis . . . 139
(c) Tuberculosis not probable but requiring follow-up examination . . . 944
(d) Children under 5 with abnormal skin test, potentially tuberculous . . . 103

(iii) Of the 408 cases referred to as "Suspect Active Tuberculosis" 53 only were already on the T.B. Register, i.e. among the 269 names to which reference is made in paragraph (i), while no case in classifications (b) (c) and (d) had ever been notified as a tuberculosis case.

(iv) This left a total of 355 cases to be urgently investigated and treated if necessary, and a further 1,187 persons requiring follow-up examinations.

By the end of December 1962, 170 "suspect active" cases and 34 of the other classifications, i.e. (b) (c) and (d), had been notified and treated for tuberculosis.

Finally, the over-all picture as at 31st December 1962 may be summarised as 453 living registered T.B. patients while, of the cases referred by W.H.O. 185 "suspect active" and 1,153 "others" still remained to be examined.

There is a high incidence of venereal diseases in the Colony and a well marked rise in the incidence of early syphilis is giving cause for concern. A special V.D. Clinic, under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health is in operation to cope with the problem.

The Public Health Service is organised under the Medical Officer of Health and the staff consists of seven Health Inspectors and nine Public Health Nurses, a Chief Health Inspector and a Senior Public Health Nurse. Six Health Inspectors are stationed in Mahé and one in Praslin, while eight Public Health Nurses are in Mahé and the ninth in Praslin.

There is a well established Ante-Natal Service in the Colony, supervised by the Medical Officer in charge of Maternity Unit. These clinics are always well attended.

The infant welfare clinics, run by the Public Health Department are well patronised; the Colony has received a C.D. & W. grant of £4,400 to cover the cost of constructing three infant welfare clinics in country districts, while equipment for the clinics has already been received from UNICEF. The UNICEF gift milk scheme has continued to function satisfactorily and is organised through the Public Health Department with the aid of a few voluntary workers.

Expenditure on medical services in 1962 was Rs. 1,042,843. In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 72,682.
Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 74 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet. Tarmac surfacing is in progress, 34 miles having been completed.

A thrice-weekly service by a new motor launch, carrying some 100 passengers is in operation between Victoria, Mahé and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. Passenger ships of the British India Line and of the Eastern Shipping Corporation combine to operate a service calling twice a month (once eastward and once westward) in the case of the former line, and twice every alternate month eastward and once westward in the case of the latter. The British India ships run from Durban to Bombay, and the Eastern Shipping Corporation operates from Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Bombay.

Occasional passenger-carrying cargo boats run directly from London (Brocklebank Line) or from Singapore (Royal Interocean Line).

Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and wired broadcasting) Station at Victoria Road, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for two hours on a wavelength of 60·2 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 40 W. The service is under the direction of the Director of Tourism and Information. Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

No receiving licences are issued.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 6,500 are so employed. Approximate numbers employed in other occupations in 1960 were:

- Domestic service: 1,750
- Public Works: 2,500
- Public administration: 250
- Trade and commerce: 400
- Skilled workers: 2,150

There are four registered Trade Unions—

1. The Stevedores and Lighterage Workers' Union.
2. The Seychelles Teachers' Union.
3. The Seychelles Cable and Wireless Limited Staff Union.
4. The Seychelles Christian Workers Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

An agricultural census was held in October 1960 when livestock was recorded as:—Cattle, 1,589; Goats, 260; Pigs, 3,058; Poultry, 21,673; there are also some 6,000 wild goats in Aldabra Island.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000–1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally-made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production has also commenced.

In 1962, 30·7% of the total imports came from the United Kingdom, 50·9% from Commonwealth countries and 18·4% from foreign sources.

In the same year 62·1% of domestic export (mainly copra) went to India, 12·9% to the United Kingdom, 4·8% to Commonwealth countries other than India, and 13·5% to foreign countries.

Tourist Trade

The number of bona-fide tourists who visited Seychelles in 1962 was 590 and a further 487 up to 27th August 1963. Insufficiency of sea communication and entire absence of air transport are still hampering development of this otherwise promising new industry.
