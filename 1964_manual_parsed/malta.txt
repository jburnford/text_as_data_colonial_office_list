Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

Malta has a healthy and fairly typical Mediterranean climate, in which extreme heat and cold are modified by the smallness of the islands and the nearness of the sea.

Mean annual rainfall is about 22 inches, which is about the same as London, though there are three almost rainless summer months.

Winters are mild, the lowest temperature recorded in the year being on average 5° C, that is 41° F; and the summers fine and sunny with maximum temperatures in August (which is the hottest month) averaging 30° C or 86° F. Only occasionally is extreme heat experienced, when a southerly wind called the Scirocco blows, as for instance in July 1962, when a temperature of 41° C, that is 106° F, was reached.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12 June 1798 Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British in 1800.

The representatives of the Maltese people, freely elected, unanimously approved a declaration of rights in 1802 in which, inter alia, they requested the protection of His Majesty the King of Great Britain and Ireland, recognised him as their Sovereign Lord, whilst maintaining that the power to establish the Constitution of the Islands, which His Majesty was bound to keep inviolate, was vested in the General Congress elected by the people.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

Constitution

After the war Malta was granted a measure of Self-Government (subject to the reservation of certain powers to the Governor) under a Constitution introduced by Letters Patent dated 5th September 1947. On the resignation of the Government led by Mr. D. Mintoff on the 24th April 1958, and the disturbances that followed, a state of emergency was declared on 30th April and the direct administration of the Island was assumed by the Governor. On the 15th April 1959, the state of emergency was brought to an end, the 1947 Constitution was revoked and replaced by an interim Constitution established by the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, and the Malta Royal Instructions, 1959.

Under this Constitution all legislative and administrative powers were vested in the Governor acting, except in certain specified cases, in consultation with the Executive Council. The Executive Council was composed of three ex officio members (Chief Secretary, Legal Secretary, Financial Secretary), three other nominated official members, and four nominated unofficial members.

Following the report of a Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Hilary Blood, a new Constitution for Malta was introduced by the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1961, under which the Island is now known as “the State of Malta”. The Constitution provides inter alia for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. The Malta Government enjoys concurrent legislative powers with the United Kingdom Government on matters of defence and external affairs (however, in August 1962, the Government of Malta was granted the power to negotiate directly with the “Six” for the eventual association of Malta with the Common Market and to deal directly with other countries for the purpose of obtaining financial and technical aid). The Governor and Commander-in-Chief is required to consult with
the Cabinet composed of a Prime Minister and seven Maltese Ministers, in exercising all his powers, with certain exceptions; a United Kingdom Commissioner is appointed to represent the Government of the United Kingdom in Malta. A Consultative Council is also appointed composed of the Governor as Chairman, the Prime Minister, the United Kingdom Commissioner, three members appointed by a Secretary of State and three members appointed by the Prime Minister, providing for consultation on policy relating to defence and external affairs, and on any matters affecting the relations between the United Kingdom Government and the Government of Malta as may be referred to it by either Government.

Elections for the fifty seats in the Legislative Assembly, as opposed to forty seats under the 1947 Constitution were held on 17th, 18th and 19th February 1962. The state of the parties in the Legislative Assembly now is: Nationalist Party twenty-six seats, Malta Labour Party sixteen seats, Christian Workers Party four seats, Democratic Nationalist Party three seats, Progressive Constitutional Party one seat. The Nationalist Party Leader Dr. Giorgio Borg Olivier, who had been Prime Minister from 1950 to 1955, was entrusted with the formation of a Government and the Cabinet was sworn in on the 5th March 1962.

On 20th August 1962, Dr. Borg Olivier made a formal request for independence within the Commonwealth. A constitutional conference was held in London in July 1963, and on the 1st August 1963, Her Majesty's Government announced their intention that Malta should become independent not later than 31st May 1964.

Land Policy

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

Taxation

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every £ of the first £200.

Development Plans

Since the end of the War, direct aid by way of free grant from Her Majesty's Government to Malta has amounted to over £54 million, mainly in respect of capital expenditure including War Damage and Reconstruction grants.

A Five-Year Development Plan for the Maltese Islands covering the period 1959-64, was published in October 1959. This was reviewed towards the beginning of the third year. The Reviewed Plan was published in July 1961 and provides for an expenditure of over £35½ million of which £29½ million was made available by Her Majesty's Government in loans (£12·48 m.) and grants (£16·77 m.), including £19½ million from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. In December 1962, negotiations were finalized for a long term loan of £2·67 million from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance in part the cost of a new power station and distillation plant.

The Plan aims at diversifying the Maltese economy which has hitherto been largely sustained by the expenditure of the fighting Services; this expenditure is declining because of changing defence policies and concepts. The measures contemplated in the Plan to achieve this end may be summarized as follows:

(a) The Harbour, which is Malta's leading natural asset, is to be developed by the conversion of the Dockyard to commercial use and by the construction of modern deep water quays and other port facilities. A £7½ million loan from Colonial Development and Welfare sources is being made for the Dockyard operation which has been entrusted to a United Kingdom firm of ship repairers. The new quays have been completed. The few outstanding works are expected to be completed shortly.

(b) Funds are provided for the building of a fully serviced industrial estate at Marsa and the construction of factories in other parts of the Island. It is expected that some seventeen factories will have been built by March 1964. Capital loans and grants are also offered to industry, in addition to an income tax "holiday" and Customs duties easements available under the Aids to Industries Ordinance. An extensive publicity campaign undertaken by an Aids to Industries Board has drawn the attention of industrialists in the United Kingdom, on the Continent and elsewhere to the wide range of aid offered. The results have been satisfactory and some 37 projects for different industries have been approved. Besides these direct aids, the Plan also sets out to provide the basic services necessary for industrialization apart from the port already referred to above, i.e., the expansion of the water and electricity supplies and the modernization and expansion of the telephone services. Technical Education is also to be developed in order to meet industry's increasing need for skills. The construction of a College of Arts, Science and Technology is well advanced and a grant of £100,000 has been secured from U.N.E.S.C.O. towards furniture and equipment.

(c) The tourist industry is being built up to take advantage of Malta's climatic, scenic and historical assets. The Capital loans and grants to industry referred to above will also be made available for hotels. The extension of essential services to hotel resort sites is being undertaken by the Government.

(d) The two indigenous industries, agriculture and fisheries, are being assisted towards greater efficiency.

(e) Although the greater share of the funds is allocated to these economic objectives, substantial provision is made for the social services—primary and secondary education, health, housing, sewers and public buildings.

(f) During the financial year ended 31st March 1963, a total of £3,719,752 was spent on development and other capital works, bringing the total expenditure for the first four years of the Development Plan to just over £17 million. Among the projects brought to completion may be mentioned the Deep Water Quay and the Grain Silo and most of their ancillary works; the construction of several factories and the provision of essential services to the Industrial Estate; the formation of housing estates in several localities and the building of a Fisheries Station. Moreover, the bulk of the school building programme is now completed, whilst good progress has been made on the erection and equipping of hospitals, the formation of roads and the mechanization of the telephone exchanges.

Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Primary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 112 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction and where Italian and French have recently been included in the curriculum, with an enrolment of 51,885 pupils; and six Grammar schools with 3,717 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded
in 1592 and raised to University status in 1769, has an average attendance of 330 students and grants degrees and diplomas in theology, law, medicine and surgery, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts, science and awards diplomas of notary public, legal procurator, architect and civil engineer and public administration. The number of Maltese studying in United Kingdom Universities or colleges during 1962 was 84. There are 210 evening classes for languages, technical and commercial subjects with an attendance of 3,988 and 67 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 900. There are three Secondary Technical Schools providing seven-year courses leading to G.C.E. Ordinary and Advanced level for 2,074 pupils of whom 745 are girls. A Technical Institute is being built to provide three to five year craft and technician courses for 725 pupils between 14 and 17 years. This Institute is to incorporate the various technical schools which are spread over different areas. An apprentices school provides five-year courses for 310 apprentices on the day release system. The College of Arts, Science and Technology founded in temporary premises in 1961 at the Old Dockyard School while permanent buildings were being erected has continued to expand. In addition to the technician level courses in engineering, a part-time professional level course was started leading to the examinations of the British Engineering Institutions. The average number of students attending the College is 140. St. Patrick's Residential School has 111 boarders, age 9 to 15. The School of Art provides seven evening classes attended by 250 persons of all ages. 228 persons are undergoing accelerated full-time technical training in various trades, at two Government Industrial Training Centres in Malta and one in Gozo. These centres were started under the vocational training scheme for prospective migrants. There is a Government home for girls with an average total of 54 inmates. The total number of private (primary and secondary) schools is 86 with an attendance of about 17,750 pupils.

In 1962–63 ordinary expenditure on education was £1,968,271; capital expenditure was £509,068. Expenditure on education in 1935 was £149,521.

Broadcasting

Under the Broadcasting Ordinance, 1961, broadcasting services in Malta were made the responsibility of the Malta Broadcasting Authority, established on 29th September 1961. The Authority has entered into agreements with Rediffusion (Malta) Limited granting an extension of their existing licence to provide a wired sound service up to 1986, and with the Malta Television Service Limited (a new company constituted in Malta and within the Rediffusion group of Companies) to provide Television and Wireless Sound Services for a similar period. In the case of Wireless Sound, the company has been allowed a period of five years within which to decide whether or not to take up this concession: if it has not done so by then the concession will lapse.

Local television transmissions were inaugurated on 29th September 1962. The service is in English and Maltese and operates on the 625 line standard. In addition, Italian Television transmissions can be received from R.A.I. (Radio Television Italiana).
