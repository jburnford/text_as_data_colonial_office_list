Geographical Features
Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000–3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chiwa and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate
The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History
The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to "The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a
British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate" but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate". The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

It has been agreed that Nyasaland shall become an independent state within the Commonwealth on 6th July, 1964.

**Constitution**

The Governor is required to consult the Cabinet in the exercise of his functions and normally acts in accordance with the advice he receives. He retains reserved powers in the fields of the economy and finance, public safety and operational control of the police. He is assisted by a Deputy Governor.

**The Cabinet**

The Cabinet which is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly, is composed of a Prime Minister, normally not more than eight other Ministers and the Financial Secretary, who is ex officio Minister of Finance. Provision exists under the Constitution that the number of Ministers can be increased if the Prime Minister considers it necessary and Her Majesty's Government concur and under which, at a time to be agreed between the Nyasaland Government and Her Majesty's Government, the Portfolio of Finance can be assumed by an elected member.

The Governor, on the advice of the Prime Minister, has power to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries to assist Ministers.

The Legislative Assembly consists of a Speaker, the Financial Secretary, so long as he is a member of the Cabinet, and, for the present 28 elected members. Any Minister who is not a member of the Legislative Assembly has the right to attend and take part in the proceedings of the Assembly, but not to vote. The Assembly has a life of not more than five years.

The 28 elected members are elected in single member geographical constituencies on a two-tier qualitative franchise containing members of all races. Twenty of these are elected in one set of constituencies by voters who satisfy the lower qualifications and eight in another set of constituencies by voters who satisfy the higher qualifications. The last general election was held in August 1961. A general election is to be held by May 1964 for an enlarged Assembly of 55 members.

The appointment of a Chief Justice is made by the Governor after consultation with the Prime Minister. Other judges of the High Court are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. Judges' salaries are prescribed by law.

The Constitution provides for Public, Police and Judicial service Commissions with executive powers.

The Constitution also embodies a Bill of Rights.

**Land Policy**

Land policy is controlled so far as African Trust Land, which comprises 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland Protectorate (African Trust Land) Orders in Council, 1950 to 1963. Under these Orders in Council Africans may use and occupy African Trust Land not held under lease in accordance with the African law and custom prevailing in the area. The Orders in Council empower the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of State's sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

**Taxation**

The taxation legislation provides, broadly speaking, only for the taxation of income which is derived from a source in Nyasaland. For example, dividends from companies not incorporated in Nyasaland are not liable for Nyasaland income tax, though such dividends may well be effectively taxed in the country of their origin.

Income Tax is calculated under two schemes of taxation, the larger amount so calculated being the amount payable.

**Scheme 1**

No account is taken in this scheme of a taxpayer's personal circumstances (whether he is single or married for example). Tax is calculated upon taxable income, which is the income which accrues to a taxpayer less the amounts which he is allowed to deduct under the legislation in production of that income. The tax rates rise from £1 10s. per year to £30 per year in steps dependent upon the amount of the taxable income. If the taxable income does not exceed £61 in the year, the tax applicable is £1 10s. and where the taxable income exceeds £1,200, the tax is £30.

**Scheme 2**

For the purposes of this scheme, a taxpayer's personal circumstances are taken into account, and personal allowances as shown below are deducted from taxable income, before tax at the rates provided is calculated. The amount remaining of taxable income after personal allowances are deducted is known as chargeable income.

The personal allowances are:

- **Single Persons**—£300 reduced by £1 for every £4 by which the chargeable income exceeds £2,000.
- **Married Persons**—£720.
- **Children**—£144 is allowable for each child (with a maximum of 4 children) for whose maintenance the taxpayer is responsible. The child or children claimed for must be under the age of 18 at the end of the year of assessment, or if over 18 must be in full time attendance at a University, college, school or other educational institution. No allowance is given in respect of any child who has an income of £150 per year (or more) in his own right.

**Life Insurance.** An allowance is given for life insurance premiums paid during the year of assessment in respect of policies on the taxpayer's life, or on that of his wife. The allowance is subject to two restrictions:

(a) The premium allowable per policy is restricted to 7% of the capital sum payable on death, exclusive of any additional benefits payable such as a bonus or profits.
(b) The total amount allowable is restricted to £144 in respect of all premiums paid.

Tax under this scheme is charged progressively on segments of chargeable income. Each segment consists of £24, and samples of the rates provided are as follows:

| Exceeding | and not exceeding | Tax for the year |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| £         | £                 | s. d.           |
| 204       | 228               | 27 0 0          |
| 300       | 324               | 39 0 0          |
| 900       | 924               | 145 6 0         |

The rates of tax payable proceed to an amount of chargeable income of £6,397, upon which tax of £2,525 12s. is payable, plus 12s. in £ for every £ of additional income over £6,397.

Pay As You Earn

As from 1st April 1964 a scheme for PAYE will be introduced, and tax calculated as described above will be deducted by employers in weekly or monthly instalments from salaries and wages as they are earned.

Tax Concessions made for Industry

(a) Premiums paid for the right to use certain assets such as patents, designs, trade-marks and copyright.—An allowance is granted, the sum allowable per year being the payment made divided by the number of years for which the right of use is granted. If this period is more than 25 years, the allowance is granted over 25 years.

(b) Research, etc.—Expenditure on research and experiments, not being of a capital nature, incurred by a taxpayer in relation to his trade is allowable as a deduction.

(c) New manufacturing businesses.—In respect of manufacturing businesses which commenced operations on or after 1st April, 1963, expenditure incurred not more than 18 months before commencement of the business can be allowed as a deduction, as long as the expenditure claimed would have been allowed had it been incurred after the commencement of the business.

(d) Capital Allowances

(i) Initial Allowance.—An initial allowance is granted, if claimed by the taxpayer, on new farm improvements, fencing, industrial buildings, railway lines or on additions or alterations to any of these items at rates as follows:

- Farm improvements, industrial buildings and railway lines: 10%
- Fencing: 33.3%

An initial allowance of 20% can be claimed also in respect of articles, implements, machinery and utensils used for the purposes of the taxpayer's trade.

(ii) Annual Allowances.—Annual Allowances are granted as follows:

- Farm improvements, railway lines and industrial buildings: 5%
- Fencing: 10%
- In respect of all other items: at rates fixed by the Commissioner.

(e) Investment Allowance: Manufacturers.—An allowance of 10% of the cost to a taxpayer of new or unused industrial buildings, plant or machinery, which are used for the purpose of manufacture is allowable. Plant and machinery does not include motor vehicles, but industrial buildings include hotels, and buildings used for the processing and distribution of fish.

The owners of plantations producing tea, coffee or tobacco are regarded as manufacturers for the purposes of the investment allowance.

* Revised estimates.

In 1962/63 revenue of £2,899,505 was received from the Federal Government under the then existing constitutional provisions, as the Nyasaland share of Federal Income Tax. Other main sources of revenue were: Taxes, Licences, etc., £1,412,601, reimbursements from and services rendered to the Federal Government £766,960. Grants from the British Government included £290,624 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act and £1,682,773 for other purposes.

In 1962/63 the main heads of expenditure on Revenue Account were:

- Works & Transport: £1,561,097
- Education & Social Development: £1,419,997
- Police: £1,092,943
- Natural Resources & Surveys: £887,010

In 1963 the Government decided that the financial year which hitherto had run from 1st July to 30th June annually should be changed to coincide with the calendar year. To conform with this decision transitional Estimates on Revenue Account were introduced covering the six months period 1st July to 31st December, 1963, thus enabling Estimates on Revenue Account covering the calendar year 1964 to be introduced on 1st January, 1964.

On Development Account the estimates covering the period 1st July, 1963 to 30th June, 1964, were curtailed on 31st December, 1963, thus enabling the Development Estimates covering the calendar year 1964 to be introduced.

The Public Debt at 30th June 1963 amounted to £10,447,118 composed of the following:

- Nyasaland Government Share of Federal Borrowings 1955–56: £900,000
- Nyasaland Government Share of Federal Borrowings 1956–57: £400,000
- Nyasaland Government Share of Federal Borrowings 1957–58: £1,128,799

Currency
At present the former Federal Currency issued by Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland remains in circulation. Towards the end of 1964 or in 1965 the present currency will be replaced by currency issued by Nyasaland and the old currency will be withdrawn during 1965.

Development Plan
On 1st January, 1964, with the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland the Nyasaland Government re-assumed responsibility for the various services formerly provided by the Federal Government. The current Development Plan which was prepared in 1962 covered only those services which were the responsibility of the Territorial Government during the period of Federation. With the take-over of former Federal responsibilities the Government has decided that a new Development Plan should be prepared in 1964.

Education
On 1st January, 1964, with the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland responsibility for educational services provided by that Government became the responsibility of the Government of Nyasaland which is now responsible for all educational matters.

A new Education Ordinance replacing that of 1945 was enacted in March, 1962, and, amongst other things, it established the popularly elected District Councils as Local Education Authorities, making the control and development of primary education a local responsibility. Each Authority through its Education Committee has carried out a survey of local educational needs and is preparing a Development Plan.

Certain very important steps were taken during the years 1962 and 1963 in the re-organisation of education. In primary education, the selection process at the end of the fifth year has been abolished and the aim is that every pupil entering an assisted primary school shall complete the primary course which is now of seven years duration. At the same time the secondary course has been lengthened to five years and the teachers' course has been extended to three years.

The Ministry's three-year Development Plan which forms part of the national Plan for the period 1962-65 lays particular emphasis on Secondary and Higher Education which, between them, account for £1,570,000 of the £2,307,000 allocated to Education.

Local Education Authorities, of which there are 20, are responsible for primary education and in 1963 controlled 928 primary streams with an enrolment of 146,356 boys and 77,463 girls. The majority of schools are owned by Voluntary Agencies, but more schools are coming into the proprietorship of the local authorities who now directly maintain 191 streams. The Government does not directly maintain or manage primary schools except in the urban areas where there are special problems. There were 17 Government streams in 1963 with 1,404 boy pupils and 1,112 girl pupils.

Priority is being given to the development of secondary education. In 1963 there were 8 streams with 697 pupils in Government Schools, and 27 streams in 17 voluntary schools with 2,528 pupils, a total of 2,377 boys and 848 girls. In 1963-64 as part of a programme of day secondary school development 7 double stream Government day secondary schools are being opened, and a further 8 being built for opening in 1965. This raises the entry to secondary schools from 600 in 1961 to 1,540 in 1964 and to 2,180 in 1965.

In technical and vocational education there were in 1963 183 male and 48 female students in Government schools and 196 male and 280 female in voluntary aided schools. A total of 280 men students were enrolled in part-time courses at Government institutions and 25 men and 3 women at voluntary aided institutions. A Further Education Centre to cater for a variety of technical and general courses including part-time, day release and evening classes was opened in Blantyre in 1963. The building of the Polytechnic commenced in 1963.

Teacher Training is conducted in 2 Government and 11 Voluntary Colleges. The new Government College at Soche Hill, Blantyre, was opened in 1963 and aims at training teachers particularly for the developing secondary schools. There were 1,410 students in training, 1,013 men and 397 women in 1963.

Expenditure on education during 1963 amounted to £1,711,254.

Libraries
Public libraries exist at Blantyre, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at secondary schools and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health
Public Health reverted from the control of the Federal Government to that of the Nyasaland Government on the 1st November, 1963.

The principal diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur, but there has recently been a severe outbreak in the Centre Province. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, re-appeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952 but again subsided.

There is 1 Central Hospital, 2 General Hospitals, 13 District Hospitals, 19 Rural Hospitals and 2 Special Hospitals—1 Mental and 1 Leprosy—with accommodation for 282 and 485 persons respectively.
Each Hospital has a number of satellite health centres of which there are 94.

There are beds for Europeans and Asians in the Central Hospital and the General Hospitals.

Mission Hospitals provide 1,615 beds, inclusive of maternity beds.

The total admissions and out-patient attendances at Federal Government Hospitals for Europeans, Asians and Coloureds and Africans at the end of December 1962 were:

| In-patients | Out-patients |
|-------------|--------------|
| Europeans   | 1,404        |
| Asians      | 925          |
| Africans    | 63,197       |

Expenditure on health services during the financial year ending June 1963 was £1,052,887.

Communications

During 1963 the Nyasaland Government reassumed from the Federal Government responsibility for Civil Aviation, inter-territorial roads, railways, and other aspects of communication.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 273 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Region. At Chipoka, south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. In 1962 949,391 short tons of freight and 612,574 passengers were carried.

The total mileage of Government maintained and grant-assisted roads is 6,116, of which just over 266 have a bituminous surface.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing one passenger and cargo ship (the "Ilala"), two cargo ships and five barges towed by five tugs. The "Ilala" schedule operates between the following lakeshore stations:

Monkey Bay, Chipoka, Nkota Kota, Likoma Island, Nkata Bay, Usisya, Ruarwe, Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika), Mlowe, Tekero, Manda (Tanganyika), Deep Bay, Kambwe (for Karonga) and Itungi (Tanganyika).

The main airport is at Blantyre from which air services of Central African Airways and East African Airways connect with Salisbury and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam. There is also an airport at Lilongwe and twelve out-station aerodromes, to eight of which aircraft of Air Malawi operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Nyasaland Director of Civil Aviation and meteorological briefing is available at Blantyre and Lilongwe airports and Mzimba aerodrome. Air services to, from, and within Nyasaland are under the control of a Higher Authority which is a body represented by Ministers from Nyasaland and the Rhodesias. External services are provided by Central African Airways Corporation and its subsidiary Air Malawi.

Broadcasting

The Nyasaland Government assumed responsibility for broadcasting from the Federal Government on the 1st September, 1963.

Pending the establishment of the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation on the 1st January, 1964, the service operated until the end of the year as a division of the Information Department.

The transmission facilities available to Radio Malawi on take-over comprised a 10 Kw. short wave transmitter in the 76 metre band and a 300 Watt medium wave transmitter in the 244 metre band. This latter transmitter is located at Blantyre and serves the Blantyre/Limbe area.

Short wave programmes from the Blantyre studio are sent to the transmitter at Mikuyu, near Zomba, by means of a post office circuit comprising a landline link from Blantyre to Limbe and a V.H.F. link to Mikuyu. Broadcasting hours have been increased to seven hours daily since the Nyasaland Government took over on the 1st September. Programmes are in Chinyanja and Tumbuka (for the Northern Province) and English.

Vernacular programmes include daily news bulletins, features, magazine programmes, plays, religious programmes, book reviews, request programmes, variety shows, indigenous folk music, and programmes for particular communities such as farmers. Detailed listener research is not possible at the moment, but judging from the thousands of letters received each month, the programmes greatly increased their popularity with their local audiences during the last quarter of the year.

It is estimated that there are some 30,000 inexpensive transistorised dry-battery sets in Nyasaland, an indication of the popularity of broadcasting, which continues to make encouraging progress.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and tea industries, retail trading, and building construction.

On 31st October, 1963 there were 18 employees' trade unions and 8 associations of employers.

Main Crops and Products

The main export crops are tea, tobacco, tung-oil, groundnuts, rice and cotton. Other major crops grown mainly for local consumption are maize, millet, cassava and miscellaneous pulses.

Exotic timber and pole plantations were extended in 1963 to give a total area of 34,519 acres. The most successful trees planted are various species of Pine, Eucalypt and Gmelina arborea. Timber and fuel production for 1962 amounted to 2,548,945 cubic feet.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa and commercial enterprises are in process of development; fishery research is being undertaken.

No minerals were exported on a commercial scale during 1962 although samples of various minerals were sent out of the country for analysis.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of soap, cigarettes and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.
Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

| Year | Imports* | Re-exports | Domestic Exports |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|
| 1958 | £9,431,979 | £154,814 | £7,350,206 |
| 1959 | £7,517,704 | £95,819 | £8,034,062 |

| 1962 | £8,163,257 | £94,644 | £10,515,844 |

* Including Government imports, but not bullion and specie.

No records are available of inter-territorial trade within the Federation and the above statistics of imports and exports refer to trade with countries outside the Federation.

The chief imports are metals, metal manufactures, machinery and vehicles; fibres, yarns, textiles and apparel, foodstuffs, oils, resins, waxes, paint and varnishes.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of the principal cash crops grown on African trust land, namely, tobacco, cotton, maize and groundnuts, is handled by a statutory board, whose aim is to ensure a steady price to the producer, as near as possible to world prices, and to secure improvement of the quality of the product. In 1962 Co-operative Societies were appointed as buying agents of the Board in all areas in respect of groundnuts and cotton. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extra-territorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1962 there were 110 primary and 7 secondary co-operative societies, with 31,133 members and 70 member societies respectively. The products handled exclusively by Co-operatives were rice, coffee and ghee. The other major crops are only handled on an agency basis.
