GAMBIA

Area
The total area, including the water area of River Gambia and its creeks and the adjoining marshes is slightly over 4,000 square miles.

Population
At the census of population taken in April 1963 the total population was 315,600, of which 27,800 in Bathurst town, 12,400 in Kombo St. Mary (the suburban area of Bathurst) and 275,400 in the rural areas. Apart from some hundreds of Europeans, Lebanese and Mauretanians residing in or near Bathurst, the population is African, mainly of the following tribes:—Mandingoes, Fula, Woloff, Serahuli and Jola. Figures of the tribal distribution are not yet available.

Principal towns
The only town is Bathurst (27,800) which is the seat of Government, the commercial centre and the chief port. Other centres, none of which exceeds 5,000 inhabitants, are the four divisional headquarters shown below and the river ports of Kaur and Kuntaur.

| Division       | Population | Headquarters   |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Western       | 55,400     | Brikama       |
| Lower River   | 97,200     | Mansakonko    |
| MacCarthy Island | 64,800 | Georgetown    |
| Upper River   | 38,000     | Basse         |

Geographical Features
The River Gambia, some 700 miles in length, flows into the Atlantic by a wide estuary which narrows to two and a half miles between Barra Point and Bathurst. There are 27 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 17 feet can at present proceed without trouble to Kuntaur 150 miles up-river. There is no bar to the River Gambia. The country consists of the Island of St. Mary (Bathurst) at the mouth of the River, the adjoining districts of Kombo, and strips of territory on each bank of the River, about seven miles wide for most of their length.

Climate
Gambia has a long dry season, normally from November to May, which is pleasant with low temperature and humidity due to the effect of the harmattan. Rainfall is confined to the period from June to October and averages about 40 inches on the coast, decreasing inland. The dry season climate near the coast is the best in West Africa. Up-river it is much hotter than on the coast especially during the period February to May, after which the heat gradually decreases with the onset of the rains. The annual mean temperature is about 80°F at Bathurst and 82°F at Georgetown. Rainfall at Bathurst in 1963 to end October was 37½ inches.

History
The banks of the River Gambia have been inhabited for many centuries. The first known written report is a reference in the account of Hanno, the Carthaginian, of his voyage down the West African coast in B.C. 470, and there are stone circles in the neighbourhood of Kuntaur which may date from the same century.

During the 5th to 8th centuries A.D. most of the Sene-Gambian area was part of the empire of Ghana, whose rulers were of the Serahuli tribe, still strongly represented in Gambia. Ghana was superseded by the kingdom of the Songhais, who were also of the Serahuli tribe.

About the 13th century Mandingoes established themselves in what is now Mali and assumed overlordship of the whole Gambia basin. The Mali rulers’ names Keita and Sonko are still prominent names among Gambian Mandingoes.

In the latter half of the 18th century the area was penetrated by Fula invaders, part of the movement which went on to found the Emirates of Northern Nigeria.

European exploration had begun in 1455 when the Gambia estuary was discovered by a Portuguese expedition commissioned by Prince Henry the Navigator. The Portuguese made no lasting settlement.

Between 1588 and 1752 Royal Charters were granted to various English merchants to trade with it. French merchants also plied during that period but the right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the treaty of Versailles in 1783. From 1807 to 1816 the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off, in part due to the abolition of the slave trade. In 1816 a new settlement was founded on the
Island of Banjul by English merchants from Senegal. Banjul was renamed St. Mary's and its town named after Lord Bathurst the then Secretary of State.

The settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone and was annexed to that Colony by Act of Parliament in 1821.

In December 1829, the Secretary of State appointed the first Lieutenant Governor "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia". The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

In 1843 the Gambia was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs.

By the charter of 1866 it became a portion of the West African Settlements and continued to be so under the charter of 1874 until it was made a separate Government in 1888 with its own Legislature.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and Kombo St. Mary was granted by the King of Kombo in the various sessions of 1840, 1850 and 1853. In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection. The rest of Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

By 1902 the boundaries of Gambia had been delimited under agreement with the French and the whole country had been pacified. Bathurst and its environs, with some small outlying areas, remained "the Colony"; and the remainder of the country was administered in four Divisions, embracing thirty-five traditional chiefdoms. Latterly six Area Councils have been created as the units of local government in the rural areas.

**Constitution**

Under the Gambia (Constitution) (Amendment) Order in Council, 1963, Gambia attained full internal self-government on 4th October 1963.

Executive authority is exercised on behalf of the Queen by the Governor, but in the exercise of his functions the Governor is normally required to obtain and act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. The Governor retains "special responsibility" for external affairs, internal security and defence, but under the provisions of the Order-in-Council current responsibilities under the first two of these headings have been delegated to the Prime Minister.

The Governor is assisted by the Deputy Governor, who performs the functions of Governor during his absence or incapacity.

The Cabinet consists of the Prime Minister and a number of other Ministers, at present eight, the Prime Minister is the elected member of the House of Representatives who leads the party which commands the support of the majority of members of the House. Ministers are appointed in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.

The House of Representatives consists of a Speaker, elected by the House; the Attorney-General, who is a public officer, ex officio; thirty-two Elected members, seven from the Colony and twenty-five from the Protectorate; four Elected Head Chiefs elected by the head chiefs; and two Nominated members appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Prime Minister. The Attorney-General and the nominated members have no vote. A Deputy Speaker is elected by the House from among its own members. The Governor may attend and address the House at any time.

The Governor retains certain legislative reserved powers in respect only of his "special responsibilities".

**Land Policy**

Individual ownership of land is recognized in Bathurst and there is no restriction on the acquisition of land by non-natives. Freehold interests in Crown lands are not disposed of except in special circumstances. A grant of Crown lands for a term of years may be made by the Governor. The normal term is 21 years with an option of renewal for a like term.

Land in the Protectorate is held on native customary tenure from the District Authority for the district in which it is vested. In general, land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 21 years. Leases of small plots suitable for commercial or industrial purposes may be obtained from the District Authority for the district, with the approval of the Governor.

**Taxation**

The main source of tax revenue is the customs tariff, which is at present supplemented by a "purchase tax" of 4%.

Company income tax is at the rates of 45% (9/- in the £).

Personal income tax is levied either on total income or on "chargeable" income under the following schedules, tax being paid on whichever schedule yields the higher tax:

**"Total Income" Schedule (not applicable to non-residents)**

| From £151 to £200 | £1 0 0 |
|-------------------|-------|
| From £201 to £250 | £1 10 0 |
| From £251 to £300 | £2 0 0 |
| From £301 to £350 | £3 0 0 |
| Exceeding £350    | 3d. per £ |

**"Chargeable Income" Sliding Scale Schedule**

| Rate per £ |
|------------|
| Up to £400 | 0s. 6d. |
| Between £401 and £800 | 1s. 0d. |
| Between £801 and £1200 | 2s. 6d. |
| Between £1201 and £2300 | 5s. 0d. |
| Between £2301 and £10,300 | 10s. 0d. |
| Above £10,300 | 15s. 0d. |

Chargeable Incomes of single persons up to £200 and of married persons up to £350 are exempt under this Schedule and there are liberal allowances for dependants, life insurance, passages etc.

Local rates are payable to the Bathurst Town Council and to Area Councils in the rural areas.

There is a direct tax on inhabitants of the Protectorate known as the District Rate which accrues to the Area Treasuries. The rate at present varies from 40s. in the more rural villages...
to 55s. in the larger towns. It is based on the "yard" of not more than four houses with thatched roofs. Houses roofed with corrugated iron carry a higher tax in most areas. There are additional rates for lodgers in the "yard" and "strange farmers".

**Public Finance**

Gambia has received grant-in-aid of administration from the United Kingdom Treasury since 1962. Recent figures of revenue and recurrent expenditure are:

| Year     | Revenue (£) | Grant-in-aid (£) | Recurrent Expenditure (£) |
|----------|------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1959     | 1,538,000  | —                | 1,816,000                |
| 1960     | 1,572,000  | —                | 1,710,000                |
| 1961     | 2,020,000  | —                | 2,154,000                |
| 1962(prov)| 1,764,000  | 536,000          | 2,299,000                |

Expenditure of a recurrent character totalling about £200,000 is currently carried by Colonial Development and Welfare grants.

The main heads of recurrent revenue in 1963 were budgeted as follows:

- Customs: £1,065,000
- Direct taxation: £200,000
- Fees, etc.: £205,000

Development receipts for 1963 were estimated at £1,030,000 (including £200,000 from the recurrent budget and £801,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare Grants). The largest item of expenditure was £334,000 for the South Bank Trunk Road.

The Public Debt at the end of 1962 amounted to £238,760, and the sinking fund to £117,000.

During 1962/63 some expenditure was incurred by advance against a local loan which is being raised in 1963/64.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London. It consists of notes of £5, £1 and 10s.; yellow metal coins of 2s., 1s., and 6d.; cupro-nickel coins of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

Allocations totalling £3½ million have been made available from time to time under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts 1945 to 1959.

The major works carried out under these Acts include:

(i) The Royal Victoria Hospital, Bathurst;
(ii) Bathurst town drainage and land reclamation schemes;
(iii) Bathurst new water supply;
(iv) Bitumenised roads in Bathurst;
(v) New High School, Bathurst;
(vi) Armitage School, Georgetown;

A V.H.F. Radio Telephone and Telegraph System was installed between 1961 and 1963. The runway of Yundum airport was completely reconstructed in 1963 under a free gift from the U.K.

A programme of further development schemes was prepared in 1963, and is to be published during 1964.

**Education**

**Education policy** provides for a six-year basic primary course, after which about half the pupils are selected by examination either for a Secondary Grammar course leading to School Certificate or a Secondary Modern course of four years.

**Primary education.**—There were about 9,800 pupils attending primary schools in Gambia in 1962/63. In Bathurst there are eleven schools run by Government. Eight are former Mission schools, taken over by Government under a Local Agreement of 1945, and are administered by Management Committees on which the former religious authority is represented. There are also a Catholic school with senior primary classes and two preparatory and Kindergarten schools, one Catholic and one Methodist.

In the suburban areas there are two Government and one Catholic primary schools.

In the rural areas there were fifty-five schools in the 1963/64 year, of which 16 are Mission schools. The remainder, formerly owned by District Authorities, are now Government institutions.

**Secondary Modern education** is provided at Crab Island School in Bathurst and at Latrikunda in the suburban area. Enrolment is 1670. In 1964 it is expected that a rural post-primary school with agricultural bias will be opened.

**Secondary Grammar education** is concentrated in Bathurst, where there are three schools. The Gambia High School, opened in 1959, is a mixed school which absorbed the former Methodist High Schools and the Bathurst School of Science. It is an independent non-denominational school administered by its own Board of Governors. Education is given up to the Advanced Level of the General Certificate of Education. The Catholic Boys' and Girls' Secondary Schools continue to operate separately. Total enrolment in 1962/63 was about 750, and about 60 pupils presented themselves for the West African School Certificate. Armitage School at Georgetown provides post-primary boarding education for boys and girls. It is to be raised to full secondary grammar standard in 1964/65 with some 300 pupils.

**Vocational Education** is provided in the Technical Trade School at Bathurst, training carpenters and metal workers, and in the Government Clerical classes, which it is planned to expand into a commercial school.

**Yundum Teacher's Training College** provides a three-year course for 150 students, preparing for posts as teachers in Government and Mission schools.
Scholarships.—There are 41 Gambians holding Government scholarships in the United Kingdom or in West Africa, and about 100 private students following part-time or whole-time courses in the United Kingdom.

Expenditure.—Government recurrent expenditure on education in the 1963 estimates was £298,000, representing about 11% of total recurrent expenditure.

Health

The most important diseases are malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, ankylostomiasis, ascariasis, filariasis, trachoma, yaws, tetanus, measles, whooping cough, anaemias. The Health Service includes mosquito control units at Bathurst, Cape St. Mary, and Yundum Airport. Health Inspectors are posted throughout the country.

Medical facilities are based upon two hospitals, at Bathurst and at Bansang, in MacCarthy Island Division. The Royal Victoria Hospital at Bathurst is a well-equipped general hospital, opened in 1953 and having 175 beds. Also in the Bathurst area are a small Sanatorium, a mental hospital, and a Home for the Infirm, also used for long stay cases. Bansang Hospital is a rural hospital of 75 beds, and nearby is a small leprosy village settlement.

There are eight Health Centres and 41 dispensaries and sub-dispensaries scattered throughout the country.

Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics are held in Bathurst and at twenty places outside Bathurst.

A dentist is on the staff of the Royal Victoria Hospital at Bathurst.

A nutrition project is being assisted by W.H.O. and UNICEF. It consists of the issue through the M.C.W. clinics of supplementary rations of skim milk and vitamin capsules (vitamins A and D) to pre-school children, pregnant women and nursing mothers.

A Leprosy Control Project is being implemented by the Government with the assistance of W.H.O. and UNICEF. Treatment is on an out-patient basis and is available at 50 clinics throughout the country. Mobile treatment circuits were introduced in 1961. At the end of the year over 4,000 patients were under treatment.

The estimated recurrent Government expenditure on the Medical and Health Services in 1963 is £258,000, representing about 10% of total recurrent expenditure.

Communications

The international aerodrome is at Yundum, 17 miles from Bathurst, a completely new runway was constructed during 1963 from a gift of £150,000 from the United Kingdom. Airport management services are provided on behalf of Government by International Aeradio Limited and Meteorological services are under the Controller of Civil Aviation. Direct scheduled flights to England are provided once weekly by British United Airways, Ghana Airways (twice weekly) and Nigeria Airways (once weekly) run flights to Dakar and down the West African Coast, connecting with services to all parts of the world. Senegal airways planes also call on their Dakar-Ziguinchor service.

There are approximately 730 miles of road in Gambia, of which 270 are to an all weather standard. During 1963 the trunk road linking Bathurst with the Dakar-Ziguinchor "Trans-Gambian" Highway was completed, but beyond the Highway all season communication has not yet been established. Roads in Bathurst and its environs are bitumenised.

The port of Bathurst is served regularly by Elder Dempster and Palm Lines and, as opportunity offers by ships of several Continental and West African lines. In 1962 import cargoes totalling 60,000 tons were handled at Bathurst and export cargoes amounted to 62,000 tons, mainly de-corticated groundnuts, plus over 10,000 transit cargoes. Groundnuts are loaded into ocean-going ships direct from the river ports of Kaur and Kuntaur.

Internal river services are maintained by the Government vessel Lady Wright. The second vessel Fulladu went out of commission during the latter part of 1962.

There are no railways.

Broadcasting

A broadcasting transmitter station "Radio Gambia" was inaugurated on 1st May 1962, operating on the 60 metre band. It transmits at present on five days a week from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated numbers in wage employment are:

| Government | Others |
|------------|--------|
|            |        |
| 2,500      | 6,000  |

There are two general Trade Unions—the Gambia Labour Union and the Gambia Workers Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are groundnuts for export (75,000 tons of undecorticated nuts were purchased in 1962-63) rice, sorghum and millet; some maize and a little cotton for village weaving are also grown.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 182,000; sheep 54,000; goats 94,000; pigs 2,000; horses 50; donkeys 2,000.

A fair amount of fish is caught in coastal waters and some in the lower river; very little however is done farther up-river, though fish are fairly plentiful. The value of smoked fish exported to Sierra Leone in 1962 was £35,000.

**Co-operative and Marketing Organizations**

The Gambia Oilseeds Marketing Board handles the export of all groundnuts and other oilseeds. Its aims are to ensure orderly marketing and to improve the quality of exports. The progressive development of Farmers' Marketing Co-operatives continues. The first society was registered in 1956; there are now 78 registered societies which handled 18% of the 1962–63 groundnut crop.
