DOMINICA

Area and Population

The area is approximately 289·8 square miles, and the population at the last census (7th April, 1960) was 59,916. The estimated population at the end of 1962 was 61,783.

Principal Town

Roseau is the capital and has a population of about 10,417.

Geographical Features

Dominica is very mountainous and picturesque. An almost continuous range of mountains rising to 4,747 feet at Imray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin, runs the whole length of the island. The island is well-watered.

Climate

The climate on the whole is good; during the cool months of the year, from December to March, it is distinctly pleasant. The dry season lasts from about February to May; June to October are generally the wettest months.

History

Dominica was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd July 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and the French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that it was thus professedly regarded as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1761, and by the Peace of Paris in 1763 was assigned to Great Britain. In 1778 the French invaded the island, which capitulated after an heroic resistance by the garrison. In 1783, it was again restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles.

Two further attempts by the French at capturing the island were made in 1795 and 1805, but they were both unsuccessful and from the latter date it has remained in undisturbed British possession.

Until 1940 Dominica was grouped with the Leeward Islands.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 64) except that provision is made for eleven elected members in the Legislative Council.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are income tax and Customs and excise duties. Income tax ranges from 4c for every dollar of the first $500 to
50c for every dollar over $10,000 of chargeable income in the case of individuals; companies are charged at the rate of 37½% on every dollar of chargeable income. *Ad valorem* duty is collected chiefly on manufactured goods and varies from 5% to 35% preferential and 3% to 75% general. Specific rates of duty apply mainly to foodstuffs. Export duty, at a varying rate, is payable on most products exported. Excise duty is payable on rum, cigarettes, cigars and black leaf tobacco.

**Development Plans**

The Colony was allocated $3,715,776 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1945 for the ten year period ended 31st March 1956 as well as further sums of $3,936,000 under the 1955 Act, $4,800,000 under the 1959 Act, and $1,680,000 under the Commonwealth Development Act 1963. Development Schemes fall under six main headings as follows:

In addition to the above, the Colony is engaged upon a programme of Public Works amounting to £405,000 financed from Loan Funds as set out below:

| Project                                      | Cost   |
