BAHAMA ISLANDS

Area, etc.

The total land area of the Colony is 4,404 square miles. It is separated on the west from Florida by the Straits of Florida and on the south from Cuba by the Old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

Population

The population at the end of 1962 was estimated at 112,556. Except for about 20%, the inhabitants are of the negro race. English is universally spoken.
Principal Town

Nassau, the capital, is the chief port and the only town of any size. It is situated on the island of New Providence, the population of which is estimated to be 57,858.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of an archipelago of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are generally long, narrow and low-lying and are of aeolian limestone formation. The soil, except in small pockets, is shallow and overlays hard rock. On the whole, it is suitable only for peasant farming. Conditions are sub-tropical and both temperate and tropical trees grow literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.

Climate

The winter climate is delightful. Frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70°, the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. In July, August and September the heat ranges from 80° to 90° and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the Colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating.

The rainfall averages about 40 inches a year. The rainy months are May, June, September and October.

History

San Salvador, one of the islands composing the Colony, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Arawak inhabitants were transported to work in the Hispaniola mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had settlements on any of the islands of the group at any time. In 1649 Parliament, on the petition of William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands" which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding an earlier Royal Grant in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles II in 1670 granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. Before the 1670 Grant the inhabitants of the islands had organized the settlement and instituted a form of government, which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected their Governor. His appointment was later confirmed by the Lords Proprietors and a regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown in 1717.

The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1686 that the settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica. By 1703 it had reached some importance, when it was almost annihilated by the French and Spaniards. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned once more. The islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place; since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1782, but were re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux and British possession was confirmed by the Peace of Versailles, 1783. After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas group and received substantial assistance from England, and in 1787 the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

The constitution of the Bahamas was eventually settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. The government was modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected House of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

Up to January, 1964, representative, but not responsible government existed. The executive government was in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who had the power of veto, and was advised by an Executive Council of not more than nine members of whom six were unofficials. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation were vested by law in the Governor in Council. A Legislative Council was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841; and in 1963 it consisted of eleven members nominated by the Crown, of whom nine were unofficials.

The General Assembly Elections Act of 1959 provided for, inter alia, adult male suffrage, and a limited second vote in respect of ownership and/or rental of real property, the latter to be exercised only in a constituency other than that in which the elector resided. The Act also provided for the creation of two additional seats for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New Providence and the redistribution of the New Providence seats after by-elections to fill the new seats. Accordingly from 1960 the House of Assembly was composed of 33 members.

A law was promulgated with effect from mid-1962 extending the franchise to women and making women eligible for election to seats in the House of Assembly.

Constitution and Administration

At the Bahamas Constitutional Conference held in London in May, 1963, the Secretary of State agreed to further constitutional changes, and these were embodied in a new Constitution which came into effect on the 7th January, 1964.

The bicameral Legislature has been reconstituted to consist of an Upper House called the Senate and a Lower House called the House of Assembly.

The Senate consists of fifteen members of whom eight are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Premier and such other persons as he may in his discretion decide to consult, five by the Governor on the advice of the Premier, and two by the Governor on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition.

The House of Assembly remains unchanged until it is dissolved in the ordinary course. Thereafter the House of Assembly will consist of thirty-eight elected members, of whom not less than eighteen nor more than twenty-two members will represent Out Island constituencies, and not
less than sixteen nor more than twenty members will represent New Providence constituencies. The next General Election will be contested on the basis of twenty-one seats for the Out Islands and seventeen for New Providence.

The Cabinet will consist of the Premier and not fewer than eight other Ministers. The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears to him to be best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly. The remaining Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier.

Land Policy

The Status of Aliens Act 1950 empowers an alien to acquire and hold property within the Colony.

Taxation

There is neither income tax nor excise duty. The general Customs duty is 20% ad valorem plus 7½% ad valorem emergency tax. Staple foodstuffs pay a low specific duty and no emergency tax; spirits and tobacco are taxed at higher rates than the general and gasoline pays a specific duty with additional sales tax. Preferential margins are designed to implement the Ottawa and Anglo-American trade agreements.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| 1958 | 5,198,975   | 5,434,533       |
| 1959 | 6,456,795   | 6,420,512       |
| 1960 | 7,988,620   | 8,337,188       |
| 1961 | 8,563,582   | 8,574,914       |
| 1962 | 8,689,155   | 9,042,292       |

The main sources of revenue are Customs dues and receipts from fees, Post Office, Licences and public utilities. In 1962 £5,338,857 of the revenue was derived from import duties. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

Development Board (£1,004,132), Medical Department (£972,066), Public Works (£1,095,032), Education (£770,962) and Telecommunications (£636,459).

In December 1962 the outstanding amount of the authorized Public Debt was £1,610,526.

Currency

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States and Canadian currencies are also generally accepted in the Colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government. Accounts are kept in sterling. There are branch banks of the Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Bank of Commerce, Barclays Bank, D.C. and O., Bank of London and Montreal, First National City Bank of New York and Chase Manhattan Bank in Nassau.

Development

The development of a Free Port in the island of Grand Bahama offers excellent prospects for employment in the future. The proposed development, financed by American capital, embraces the construction of a large deep-water harbour at Hawksbill Creek. The Free Port Authority has acquired 50,000 acres of land and plans have been drawn up for zoned areas in the vicinity of the proposed harbour, for industrial projects of all kinds and town planning on the most up-to-date lines. This large-scale project is not a Government scheme but was approved by the Bahamas Legislature. Licences to operate within the Free Port area are granted by the Free Port Authority.

The Bahamas Government has undertaken to supply administrative, police, customs and immigration staff which will remain under its control. The Free Port Authority will provide its own medical and educational facilities but there is provision for inspection of these services by Bahamas Government medical and education officers. In general the closest liaison has been established between the Government and the Authority.

Education

A new comprehensive Education Act known as the Education Act 1962, and modelled in principle on the 1944 Education Act in the United Kingdom, came into effect on 1st September, 1962. The new Act places all government effort in the field of education under one authority, the Board of Education, and provides the machinery for the development of a modern system of education in the future. Under the Act, education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 14. Of a total of 144 Government primary schools, 130 are rural, all-age schools.

Secondary education is provided by the Board of Education and by independent religious authorities. Of a total of 15 Secondary Schools, 5 are owned by the government and 4 are grant-aided; 6 of them (all independent) have their own primary departments.

There is one reformatory school for boys under the Industrial School Act and one for girls.

No local provision is made for Higher Education and students seeking this type of training must go abroad. Bahamians studying abroad in 1962–63 session were:

- 116 in the United Kingdom
- 9 in Canada
- 160 in the United States of America

Total 285

The Teachers' Training College which was temporarily closed in 1957 was re-opened in September 1961. In addition, the Board now has a scholarship scheme for:

(a) Refresher courses for experienced teachers.
(b) Degree courses.
(c) Specialist Diploma courses. All these scholarships are tenable in the U.K.

The following table shows the number of schools and of the children attending them in 1962:

| Primary Schools | Roll | Secondary Schools | Roll |
|-----------------|------|-------------------|------|
| Government      | 144  | 14,400            | 5    | 5,362 |
| Others          | 50   | 6,700             | 11   | 2,150 |
| Total           | 194  | 21,100            | 16   | 7,512 |

The expenditure on Education in 1962 was £770,962.
Libraries

There are three Public Libraries in Nassau and 27 in the Out Islands.

Health

The medical needs of the Colony are met by the Princess Margaret Hospital (General), Prospect Hospital (Isolation and Geriatrics), the Sandilands Mental Hospital, Out Island Clinics on every major island, Cottage Hospitals at Eleuthera and Inagua, and the private Rassin Clinic. There are also District Medical Officers in Out Islands. In addition there is a Public Health Nursing Service.

Hospital services are chargeable at sub-economic rates and provided free to needy persons. Clinics of all kinds are held and there is a schools medical service.

In 1962 the in-patients numbered 11,408 with 240,773 in-patient days' treatment, and out-patients 63,296. The principal diseases are tuberculosis, respiratory complaints, general abdominal complaints, hypertension and malnutrition.

Expenditure in 1962 was £972,066, compared with £25,695 in 1936.

Communications

Nassau International Airport is the main airfield in the Bahamas. It provides 24-hours service for long range international and local airlines. In addition, there are 23 landing strips completed in the various Out Islands. Scheduled international air services are operated into Nassau by B.O.A.C. from London via New York and Bermuda, and from Montego Bay, Jamaica. Pan American World Airways operate daily flights from Miami and New York, Trans-Canada Airlines from Montreal via Tampa, Florida, Mackey Airlines from Tampa, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach. Bahamas Airways Limited operates between Miami and Nassau several times daily.

Internal air services are run by Bahamas Airways Limited, and by Out Island Air Services with a fleet of amphibian aircraft.

During 1962 16,040 landings were recorded at the main airport.

The following mileage is of roads in New Providence, practically all of which may be used by motor traffic:

| Maintained by Public Works Department | Total Miles |
|---------------------------------------|-------------|
| Bituminous surface                     | 147·5       |

| Earth surface                         | 20·00       |

On Eleuthera there is an asphalt main road 60 miles in length covering the greater part of the Island and on Grand Bahama, 65 miles of motor road has been built. Asphalt roads are under construction at Andros, Exuma, Eleuthera, Cat Island, Spanish Wells and San Salvador, where previously only rough tracks existed.

There are no railways in the Colony.

There are regular freight services between the Colony and New York and Florida; Halifax and Montreal (Canadian National Steamship Line); and the United Kingdom (Royal Mail Line and Pacific Steam Navigation Company). West India Steamships Ltd. operate a service between Nassau and Inagua with intermediate stops.

In 1962 6,162 ships entered and 4,843 were cleared at Nassau. Their total tonnage was 10,319,086, of which 1,288,218 tons was British. Ships also call at Inagua and Pine Ridge to take on salt and lumber exports.

Sound and Television Broadcasting

Government owns, and the Bahamas Broadcasting and Television Commission operates, a broadcasting station located in Nassau. The power of its transmitter is 5kW., frequency 1,540 kc/s, and call sign ZNS. Commercial operation began in 1950, though a broadcasting station has existed since 1936. The Commission took over on 1st January 1957. The broadcast receiver licence fee was abolished in 1954. At that time there were 5,990 licence holders. Government supplied and maintains 60 community receivers in school-houses in the Out Islands where there may be as many as 200 listeners in the evenings.

Principal Occupations

The tourist traffic continues to be the main industry of the Colony and is the chief source of revenue and of dollars.

The following table shows the number and nationality of visitors to New Providence during the years 1957-62:

| Visitors | U.S.A. | Canada | U.K. | Others |

Agricultural work in the United States provides employment for an average of 1,195 unskilled Bahamian labourers and their earnings in 1962 amounted to £2,925,765.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are fresh vegetables, tomatoes, okra, pineapples, peas, citrus, bananas, avocados and sisal.

The estimated livestock population is: horses and mules 3,520, cattle 3,000, sheep 22,000, goats 14,000, swine 10,500, and poultry 600,000.

Exports of timber in 1962 totalled 17 M. ft., valued at £625.

Crawfishing and scale fishing are extensively carried out during the open season (October 1st-March 15th). The bulk of the catch is exported to the United States. The following marine products are also exported:—sponges, salt, turtle shell, beach shells and marine curios.

There are four canning plants in the Colony which are engaged principally in canning tomatoes and pineapples. Straw products are manufactured as cottage industries and the raw material for this work is obtained chiefly from palm fronds and sisal fibre. Most of the canneries' output is consumed locally.

In 1938 23·8% of total imports came from the U.K.; 18·5% from other Commonwealth countries and 57·7% from foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1962 were 16·6, 11·5 and 71·9.

In 1938 22·6% of exports went to the U.K.; 22·5% to other Commonwealth countries, and 54·9% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1962 were 4·8, 1·9 and 93·3.

Nearly all the Colony's requirements are imported. The chief imports are apparel, liquors, machinery, motor vehicles, electrical apparatus, petroleum oils and foodstuffs of all kinds.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Bahamas Produce Exchange in Nassau handles much of the agricultural produce of the Colony. It assists the farmers in New Providence and Out Islands in disposing of their produce without glutting the market and depressing prices unnecessarily.

There are no co-operative societies in the Colony other than 17 Tomato Growers' Associations on the Islands of Eleuthera and Cat Island and 21 active Farmers' Associations situated throughout the Colony. These associations are assisted by the Board of Agriculture to the extent of advancing seed and fertilizer, etc., for the tomato and other crops. The Board markets the crops and deducts their advances from the proceeds of each consignor.
