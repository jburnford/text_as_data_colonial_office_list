MONTSERRAT

Area and Geographical Features
The area of the island is about 32 square miles. It is entirely volcanic, very mountainous and comprises three main hill masses—Silver Hill in the north (1,285 feet), Central Hills (2,450 feet) and Soufrière Hills (Chance Peak 3,002 feet) in the south. Forest and woodland cover about 10 square miles in the two main ranges and streams are plentiful. The northern hills, however, are almost without trees and in that part of the island there is little cultivation.

Population
The population numbered 12,108 at the 1960 census, and was estimated to be 12,945 at the end of 1962.

Principal Town
Plymouth, the only town, had a population of 1,911 at the 1960 census.

History
The island was colonized in 1632 when a number of Irishmen of Sir Thomas Warner's company made their homes there. It was captured by the French in 1667, restored to England at the Peace of Breda later in the same year, capitulated to the French again in 1782 and was finally ceded to Britain in 1783.

Constitution
The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 64) except for the following differences:

(i) In Executive Council there are four unofficial members (the Chief Minister, two other Ministers and a Member without Portfolio) and two official members (the Crown Attorney and the Financial Secretary). These three Ministers are appointed from the elected members of the Legislative Council.

(ii) The present composition of the Legislative Council is the Administrator, who presides, two official members, one nominated unofficial member and seven elected members.

(iii) Montserrat shares a joint Police Force with Antigua and the Virgin Islands. The head of this joint Force is appointed by the Administrator of Antigua acting in his discretion and gazetted ranks of the Force are appointed by the Administrator of Antigua after consultation with the Police Service Commission.

Land Policy
Crown land comprises the Government Land Settlement, where occupation is confined to an annual lease, and a small area acquired for public purposes. All other land is privately owned.

Taxation
The following forms of direct taxation are in force:

Income Tax (ranging from 6d. to 15s. per £ of chargeable income; companies 6s. 8d. per £ of chargeable income).
Land and House Tax.
Motor Vehicles Tax.
Bicycles Tax.
General Taxes.

The other main forms of taxation are import and export and excise duties.

A short account of the events leading up to the establishment of the Federation in September, 1953, and a summary of the Federal Constitution, are to be found in the 1954 and 1955 editions of the Colonial Office List. In January, 1962, the British Government granted the right of secession from the Federation to Nyasaland, and in April, 1963, to Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia. A conference to discuss the problems involved in dissolution was held at Victoria Falls in June, 1963, and dissolution took place on 31st December, 1963.
