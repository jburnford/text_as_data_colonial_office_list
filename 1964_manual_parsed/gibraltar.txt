GIBRALTAR

Geographical Features and Area

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, with an area of 24 square miles. It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 24 miles and its greatest breadth nearly 1 mile.

Population

The population is European and at the Census of October 1961 numbered 24,075. At the end of 1962 the estimated population was 24,151.

Climate

The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the "Levanter", strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.

History

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

Constitution

The Gibraltar (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1950, as amended by further Orders in Council, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, the Speaker, three ex officio members, two nominated members appointed by the Governor and seven elected members. The ex officio members are the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. The Order in Council empowers the Governor to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony with the advice and consent of the Council. The Governor possesses the usual reserved power to pass into law any measure necessary or expedient in his opinion in the interests of public order, public faith or good government (including defence).

The Gibraltar Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions provide that the Governor shall be advised in the exercise of his powers by an Executive Council consisting of four ex officio members and four unofficial members. The ex officio members are the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

In September 1962, the Secretary of State for the Colonies approved a proposal that much of the day-to-day work of the Executive Council should be referred by the Governor in Council to a Council of Members, on the understanding that it would be in the discretion of the Governor to decide what matters should be referred to the Council of Members and that the recommendations of the Council of Members would be referred back to the full Executive Council.

The Council of Members is composed of the four unofficial members of Executive Council under the Chairmanship of the Chief Member.

Taxation

This is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance came into force in 1953; the standard rate of tax is 3s. in the £, but rates for individuals range from 6d. to 4s. in the £. There are no excise duties.

The main heads of taxation are:

Customs.
Income Tax.
Estate Duties.
Stamp Duties.
Licences.
Fuel Oil Tax.

The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco, coffee, mechanical lighters, motor vehicles, motor vehicle spares and accessories, photographic cameras and cinema projectors, radio sets and spares, razor blades, watches and clocks, fountain pens, including ball-point pens, binoculars, telescopes, sound recorders, sound reproducers and recording media.

The Government lottery yielded £143,556 in 1962.

Gibraltar Government notes and United Kingdom silver and copper coins are legal tender in the Colony. Notes to the value of £1,397,447 were in circulation at 31st December 1962. The issue is governed by the Currency Note Ordinance and is of the following denominations: £5, £1, 10s.

Development Plans

The new Customs, Police and Immigration buildings at the Frontier with Spain and the 10-acre rain water catchment as well as the new road to Catalan Bay were completed in 1963.

Work on two of the three hotels under construction as well as an extension to another are now well advanced and should be completed by mid-1964. The Air Terminal is being enlarged to deal with the increased tourist traffic. With the assistance of Colonial Development and Welfare funds, progress in the construction of new flats is being maintained. Work on the construction of the Casino is now well in hand and three new Homes for the Aged and the Mackintosh Hall are due to be completed shortly. A concession has been granted to a local firm to set up an Aerial Ropeway to Signal Hill on the top of the Rock where in addition to having an observation terrace it is also proposed to have a restaurant. With the clearance of a site at North Front formerly used for temporary housing a new area is being opened up for industrial purposes.

Education

There are eight secondary and fourteen primary and infants' schools conducted by the Department of Education, with a total of 3,925 pupils at 31st December 1962. In addition there are three unaided schools with an enrolment of 655. Government expenditure on education in 1962 amounted to £175,021 compared with £9,863 in 1935.

Approximately 40 students of both sexes are undergoing courses of higher education in the United Kingdom.

Libraries and Museums

A lending library is maintained by the British Council. At the Gibraltar Garrison Library, established in 1793, an extensive reference section and a well-supplied lending library are available to members. The Museum contains exhibits of historical interest connected with Gibraltar.

Health

Total expenditure on medical and public health services in 1962 was £228,861 compared with £22,966 in 1935. The number of beds available in hospitals was:

Communications

There is no civil airfield in the Colony, but restricted use of the R.A.F. aerodrome at North Front by civil aircraft is permitted, subject to termination if military considerations so require. British European Airways operate daily services between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom both direct and via Madrid. Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service (two flights) to and from Tangier.

The length of road open for traffic is 5½ miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3½ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.

The total arrivals of merchant vessels during 1962 were 4,389 with a net tonnage of 10,765,623. The majority called for bunkers, the discharge of cargo and passengers, provisions and repairs. The following passenger services were in operation:

- Orient Line, United Kingdom/Australia: 2 monthly
- Union Castle Line, United Kingdom/East Africa: 2 monthly

Approximately one cargo vessel a week arrived from the United Kingdom. A daily passenger and car ferry service to and from Tangier is operated by the Bland Line. There is also a daily passenger service between Gibraltar and Algeciras.

Broadcasting

A Government Broadcasting Station (Radio Gibraltar) broadcasts in English and Spanish for approximately 12 hours daily, an average of 30 hours weekly being devoted to commercial broadcasting. In addition to live and locally recorded programmes, use is made of B.B.C. transcriptions and relays. The power of the station is 1kW and it operates on a frequency of 1,484 kc/s, 202·2 metres. Its coverage is about 50 miles. There is also a local wired broadcasting service operated by the Military Authorities for military personnel, which relays programmes from the B.B.C. During 1962, 4,604 radio receiving licences were issued.

Television

A licence to establish a commercial television station was granted to Gibraltar Television Co. Ltd., and test transmissions began in 1961. On the 1st October, 1962, the Company started to operate for approximately three hours daily on the standard European system of 625 lines on Channel 6. There were over 2,400 licensed T.V. sets at the end of September, 1963.

Principal Occupations

Almost half of the male wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Colonial Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment.
Other local industries are the processing of tobacco, the roasting and blending of coffee, the canning of fish and fruit and the manufacture of ice, mineral water, sweets and various items of clothing.

At the end of December 1962 the total insured labour force was 16,357. There are 26 registered trade unions in the Colony. The reported total paid-up membership of the 16 employees' unions was 3,750.

Trade

Actual figures of imports are available only for dutiable articles and the figures given below are therefore largely estimates:

Tourist Trade

The value of the tourist trade is estimated at about £2,000,000 per annum.

The number of visitors passing through the Colony continues to increase. To meet this increase two luxury hotels are in course of construction. In addition every possible facility is being given. Places of interest such as the Caves, Galleries, Moorish Castle and the Upper Rock may be visited without permits.
