TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS

Area

The Turks Islands Bank and the Caicos Bank cover an area of approximately 75 by 50 miles to the south-east of the Bahama Islands. The total land area is estimated at 166 square miles.

Population

The total population at the 1960 Census was 5,714 and the estimated population at 31st December 1962 was 6,035.

Principal Towns

The towns and largest settlement are Grand Turk, Cockburn Harbour (South Caicos) and Bottle Creek (North Caicos), with populations of 2,339, 866 and 1,076 respectively.

Geographical Features

The Turks Islands consist of two inhabited islands, Grand Turk and Salt Cay, six uninhabited cays and a large number of rocks. The principal islands of the Caicos group are South Caicos, East Caicos, Middle (or Grand) Caicos, North Caicos, Providenciales and West Caicos. Geographically the islands are a part of the Bahama chain and have the same flat characteristics, there being no land above 250 feet. The Turks Islands are separated from the Caicos Islands by a 22-mile stretch of ocean water known as the Turks Islands Passage; the Caicos Islands are surrounded by a shallow water reef. The islands generally are arid and stony.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow constantly throughout the year, giving an equable and healthy climate. Rainfall is variable and tends to be higher in the Caicos Islands; on Grand Turk the annual average is about 21 inches. The temperature ranges throughout the year from 60° to 90°. Severe hurricanes occurred in 1866, 1873, 1888, 1908, 1926, 1928, 1945 and 1960.

History

The Caicos Islands were settled by loyalist planters from the Southern States of America after the War of Independence. After the abolition of slavery in 1838 the planters left the islands, their former slaves remaining in possession. In the meantime, in 1799, the islands were annexed by the Bahamas Government, but in 1848 a separate charter was granted to the islands divorcing them from the control of the Bahamas. After a period of severe financial stringency, the Legislative Council in 1873 petitioned Her Majesty that the islands might be annexed to the Colony of Jamaica and from 1874 to July 1959 they were one of its dependencies.

An Order in Council of 1873 which annexed the islands to Jamaica made provision for the constitution of a Legislative Board for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Elections, based on adult suffrage, were held for the unofficial seats for the first time in 1953. The Commissioner was ex officio President of the Board, which had full legislative and budgetary powers, but ordinances required the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming law. Laws passed by the Legislature of Jamaica did not apply to the Dependency unless they were made applicable in express terms. The revenues and expenditure are independent of those of Jamaica.

On the 20th February 1958 the Royal Assent was given to the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands Act, 1958, by which Her Majesty was empowered to make provision by Order in Council for the government of the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands.

In 1953 the United States Government completed a Guided Missile Observer Station at Grand Turk, under an extension of the Bahamas Agreement.

A United States Government Naval Facility for Oceanographic Measurement was established at Grand Turk in 1954.

Constitution

The Turks and Caicos Islands (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, provided for a new constitution which was brought into operation on the 4th July 1959. Under it the office of Governor of the Islands was constituted (the Governor of Jamaica was also Governor of the Islands) and the office of Commissioner replaced by the office of Administrator. The former Legislative Board was replaced by a Legislative Assembly consisting of the Administrator as President, two or three official members appointed by the Governor, two or three nominated non-official members appointed by the Governor and nine members elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage; and an Executive Council was introduced consisting of the Administrator, two official members, one nominated member and two elected members (elected by the nominated and elected members of the Assembly from among the elected members of the Assembly).

On the 6th August 1962, when Jamaica attained independence, the Islands became a direct Crown Colony and the post of Governor was abolished. A new Constitution then came into force, basically the same as that of 1959, but with the powers formerly exercised by the Governor now to be exercised by the Administrator.
Land Policy

Much of the land on the salt islands (South Caicos, Salt Cay and Grand Turk) is held on private freehold title. The law limiting the rights of aliens to own land was repealed in 1953.

Taxation

The main heads of taxation are Customs import duties (15% preferential and 20% general f.o.b.) and a special tax of 4% on all dutiable goods. There is very little direct taxation.

Development Plans

The Islands received an allocation of £75,000 under the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. A further sum of £30,000 allocated to the Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands has been held back against future requirements.

Education

There are 13 Government elementary schools in the Islands. The one at Grand Turk has in addition a Senior Section. In 1962 there were some 1,396 pupils on the rolls and the average attendance was 1,182. Expenditure on education during 1962 amounted to £20,905 compared with £840 in 1935.

Libraries

There is a public library at Grand Turk.

Health

There is a 16-bed cottage hospital of modern design at Grand Turk, together with a dental clinic. Medical officers, recruited from Jamaica and England, are stationed at Grand Turk and at Cockburn Harbour on South Caicos. There is a clinic at Cockburn Harbour, a maternity clinic in the charge of a midwife at Bottle Creek on North Caicos and a district midwife at Salt Cay. Expenditure on medical services in 1962 was £20,727, compared with £990 in 1935. An X-ray unit has been installed at the Grand Turk Hospital.

Communications

There are airfields at Grand Turk and South Caicos. The former is a military airstrip constructed by the United States Government in connexion with the Guided Missile Project. A weekly air service with Nassau, now increased to a twice-a-week service, was begun in 1956. There is an irregular mail, freight and passenger service to Jamaica by sea and ships call occasionally from Holland and the United States.

Grand Turk is an important junction of cables to Jamaica, Barbados and Bermuda. A radio telephone system connects Grand Turk with Salt Cay and the Caicos Islands as well as providing a service with Jamaica and the United States.

There is no broadcasting service but Cable and Wireless (West Indies) Limited broadcast a five-minute daily programme of news and announcements.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of the Turks Islands group and of South Caicos are normally engaged in the production (by solar evaporation) and the shipping of salt. A grant of £35,200 was made from Colonial Development and Welfare funds during 1958 to provide modern loading facilities and £31,000 in 1961 for fine salt plant and equipment. The remainder of the Caicos population are mainly fishermen and do a limited amount of subsistence agriculture. A large proportion of the male population is usually absent from home working in the Bahamas lumber camps, the Inagua salt works or as crews on merchant ships.

Main Crops and Products

Sisal is grown under conditions of peasant agriculture in the Caicos Islands, but the quality is poor, owing to the absence of fresh water for retting and washing. Salt is the main product of the Islands. Crawfish are exported frozen to Florida and conchs are sold dried to Haiti.
