Geographical Features

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000–5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great natural lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 8,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world and, Lake Kariba, the largest man-made lake in the world; and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 726 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°–100° but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. de Lacerda, who led an expedition to Chief Kasembe's capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in 1798. Though he died before reaching his goal, his diaries provide the first authoritative account of what is now north-eastern Rhodesia. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to
Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty's Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be and on 17th October 1900 the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika's dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company's administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

From September, 1953, the Protectorate was one of the three territories comprised in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 144). This Federation was dissolved on December 31st, 1963. During the ten-year period of the Federation certain Departments and services were taken over by the Federal Government. These included: Audit, Civil Aviation, Military, Prisons, Customs, Income Tax, Posts and Telegraphs, European Education, Health and European Agriculture. During this period an independent Corporation was also set up to control Broadcasting.

**Constitution**

A new Constitution for Northern Rhodesia under which the territory will proceed to internal self-government came into effect on 1st January 1964.

The Governor retains responsibility on behalf of Her Majesty's Government for defence and external affairs and can reserve for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure any Bill which in his view is inconsistent with any obligations imposed on Her Majesty by any treaty, convention or agreement with any country or international organisation, or is likely to prejudice the royal prerogative.

The Governor is assisted by a Deputy Governor appointed by the Governor on Her Majesty's instructions.

The Executive Council has been replaced by a Cabinet consisting of a Prime Minister and 13 other ministers holding portfolios assigned by the Governor in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister who presides over the Cabinet. All Cabinet papers and minutes of Cabinet meetings are circulated to the Governor.

The Attorney General continues to be the official legal adviser to the Government, but is not a minister or a member of the Cabinet.

Parliamentary Secretaries are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Prime Minister.

The Legislative Assembly totals 75 members, 65 elected in main roll (African) constituencies and 10 in reserved roll (European) constituencies. (Asians and coloured persons were allowed to opt on which roll they wished to vote.) Members of any race were eligible to stand as candidates in all constituencies providing they possessed the necessary qualifications to be a voter on either roll.

There is a House of Chiefs.

The Governor retains responsibility for public order and for the use and operational control of the police force, but he may delegate such responsibilities if he thinks fit.

The Constitution contains a Bill of Rights which sets out the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual and provides protection from discrimination on grounds of race. There is a Constitutional Council whose functions will include that of considering whether Bills referred to it by Members of the Legislature are inconsistent with the Bill of Rights.

The Constitution provides for the establishment of a High Court and of a Court of Appeal. A Judicial Service Commission deals with appointment, disciplinary control and removal from office of the magistracy, and also advises the Governor on the appointment of Judges.

The Public Service Commission and the Police Service Commission will become fully responsible during the course of 1964 for appointments, disciplinary control and removal from office of members of the civil service and the senior members of the police.

At the general election on 20th January 1964, there were 1,401,325 registered voters of whom 1,377,349 were registered on the main roll, and 23,976 on the reserved roll.

The state of the parties in the Legislative Assembly is as follows:

- United National Independence Party . . 55
- National Progress Party . . . . 10
- African National Congress . . . . 10

**Land Policy**

Land in the Territory, apart from Barotseland, is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land in the City of Lusaka and in the Municipal Townships is alienated by Head Lease to the Local Authority which in turn sub-lets to an approved applicant. Leaseholders may
obtain freehold on completion of the development required under their leases. Crown Land in the smaller townships is alienated by direct lease from the Crown but subject to the recommendation of the Local Authority. Freehold conversion is not obtainable. Crown Land for agricultural purposes is alienated on leasehold tenure to applicants who prove that they have the necessary finance and farming experience to make full use of the land. Under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Ordinance the lessee of declared agricultural land may obtain a conditional freehold title to his farm on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance. There is in certain areas freehold land which was granted in the early days.

Taxation

At the time of going to press responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and customs and excise duties is reverting to the Northern Rhodesia Government.

Public Finance

The dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on December 31, 1963, will result in changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements.

The main sources of revenue in the financial year ended the 30th June, 1963, were the payments received from the Federal Government, representing 18% of the collections within the Federation on account of taxes on income, and the Territorial Surcharge on Company Income Tax assessments collected by the Federal Government on behalf of the Northern Rhodesia Government. These two taxes represented 56.2% of the actual revenue for 1962-63 and a further 12.2% was derived from mineral royalties. Customs and Excise duties were collected by the Federal Government and, in accordance with the existing fiscal arrangements, these were not shared with the Territorial Governments of the Federation.

During the 1962-63 financial year, the Federal Government continued to have full financial responsibility for the Departments and services it had taken over following the establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October, 1953. The principal Departments and services taken over were as follows:

- Audit
- Broadcasting
- Civil Aviation
- Customs and Excise
- European Agriculture
- European Education
- Health
- Income Tax
- Military
- Posts and Telegraphs
- Prisons.

With the dissolution of the Federation, the financial responsibility for these Departments and services, together with their attendant revenues, revert to the Northern Rhodesia Government.

Currency

Up to the 23rd April 1957 the currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The denominations were 10s., £1, £5 and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper halfpennies and pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns.

On the 23rd April 1957 however, the Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which took over the assets of the Central Africa Currency Board on the 1st April 1956 commenced the issue of new currency notes of the denominations of 10s., £1, £5 and £10. The two types of currency now circulate together, but the new will gradually replace the old as the latter becomes unfit for circulation. As from the 1st January 1955 British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Development Plan

Work is progressing in accordance with the Northern Rhodesia Government's approved Development Plan for the period from 1st July,
1961 to 30th June, 1965, which envisages the expenditure of £30 million as follows:

| Economic Development—Rural Areas | 10,500,000 |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| Economic Development—Crown Land Settlement | 400,000 |
| Economic Development—Urban Areas and Rural Townships | 10,388,000 |
| African Education and Staff Training | 5,000,000 |
| Administrative and General Services | 3,712,000 |

£30,000,000

An extension of the Plan is being prepared to provide for works arising from the transfer of Federal functions back to the Territorial Government.

**Education**

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954 and only reverted to the Territorial Government at the end of 1963.

In July 1961 there were 58 Government schools and 12 Government-aided private schools providing education for European children. Ten of the Government schools and one private school provided education up to the Cambridge School Certificate standard.

The enrolment in European Government schools was 15,194; in Government-aided private schools, 2,302. Technical education for apprentices is provided at Broken Hill, Lusaka and Livingstone. Government assistance in the form of scholarships, bursaries, grants and loans is available under certain conditions for higher education. European, Asian and Coloured students from Northern Rhodesia attend the Teachers' Training College at Heany, near Bulawayo, and the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Salisbury.

There were 13 Government primary and secondary schools and one Government-aided private school for Asian and Coloured children. The total enrolment of Asians was 1,712; and of Coloureds, 525.

No exact figures are available for the number of African children in each age group. For the first time a territorial population census was carried out in 1963, but the final figures are not yet available. Of the primary school age group (7–14 years inclusive) the total number in schools was 348,342. There are 8,581 pupils pursuing secondary or undergoing some form of vocational training at schools or colleges aided or maintained by the Ministry of African Education.

The enrolment in the various types of educational institutions in September, 1963, was:

| African schools | No. of schools | No. of pupils, etc |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools | 1,721 | 342,105 |
| Unaided primary schools | 48 | 6,237 |
| Maintained and aided secondary schools | 42 | 6,525 |
| Unaided secondary schools | 8 | 525 |
| Aided and maintained teacher training colleges | 13 | 1,251 |
| Unaided teacher training colleges | 1 | 120 |
| Aided and maintained trades and technical schools | 16 | 805 |
| Unaided trades schools | 2 | 231 |

There were three post-secondary courses in operation (with some 194 pupils), namely Sixth Forms at Munali Secondary School, Chipembi Secondary School and Canisius College and two courses at Chalimbana Training College, one for the training of teachers for upper primary schools and one for training junior secondary school teachers. Bursaries are awarded both by the Federal Government and the Northern Rhodesia Government for students to attend various courses of advanced education. The Northern Rhodesia Government also awards bursaries to enable its civil servants to train for promotion within the Public Service. There were 239 persons in receipt of Northern Rhodesia Government bursaries at the 31st August, 1963 taking courses in Africa, Great Britain, Eire, India, Israel, Canada and the United States of America. Some of these bursaries supplement scholarships and bursaries awarded by Commonwealth Governments, the United States of America, the Governments of Israel and India and by the British Council.

**Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.**

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. While emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions, research into the problems of the immigrant races is also undertaken. Since 1st April 1962 the Institute has been incorporated into the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times. The library contains approximately 6,000 volumes which are available to members of the Northern Rhodesia Society.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

**Health**

Arising from the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the former Federal Health Services reverted to the control of the Northern Rhodesia Government on 1st December, 1963.

Government medical facilities in the territory include two central hospitals situated at Lusaka and Kitwe and General Hospitals at Livingstone,
Broken Hill and Ndola, offering facilities for all races.

There are also seventeen district hospitals, the majority of which have a medical officer in charge and 33 rural hospitals.

There is a mental hospital accommodating 164 patients.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 140 rural health centres and 33 urban clinics.

During 1962 a total of 180,042 patients were admitted to Federal Government hospitals and there were 9,487,052 out-patient attendances at Government institutions.

Extensions to the Mental Hospital are being planned and active consideration is being given to the training of state registered nurses in the Llewellyn Central Hospital, Kitwe.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications. These responsibilities reverted to the Northern Rhodesia Government at the end of 1963.

There are main airports at Livingstone, Lusaka and Ndola with bituminous surfaced runways, and one at Kasama with gravel runway, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. Subsidiary airfields serve most of the outlying districts.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 655 miles.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the Territory at the 31st December 1962 was 21,129·8 made up as follows:

| Miles |
|-------|
| Inter-territorial main roads | 1,923·7 |
| Territorial main roads | 1,922·8 |
| District roads | 13,666·3 |
| Native Authority roads | 3,617·0 |

There are 788·0 miles of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes main roads through townships.

Broadcasting

With the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland the Federal Broadcasting Corporation is being replaced by the Northern Rhodesia Broadcasting Corporation.

In 1962 the approximate number of cattle owned by Europeans was 214,704. African owned livestock totalled 1,056,188 cattle, 175,782 sheep and goats and 61,251 pigs. More than 52,640 head of local cattle were slaughtered by licensed butcheries during the year.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is transported to line-of-rail centres, either dry or preserved on ice. Fishing is being stimulated on the Southern Sector of Lakes Tanganyika and Kariba.

Output of sawlogs, poles and firewood amounted to 212,598 tons in 1962.

A large variety of manufactured goods are now produced in the Territory. Main manufactures are: Cement products, tiles, steel and wood furniture, steel finishing work, beer, mineral waters, metal castings and nuts and bolts, sugar, plastics, soap, copperware, nails, dry ice, pottery, sweets, cigarettes, edible oils and fats, and boats.

Trade

Internal trading continues to improve. Higher wages, especially on the Copperbelt, have raised the purchasing power of Africans and this is reflected in increased turnover. The agricultural industry has, overall, experienced favourable conditions and sales of agricultural implements are higher. Exports of such items as blankets and batteries to neighbouring countries have been maintained.

The mainstay of the economy, however, continues to be the primary industries of mining and agriculture, and the principal exports, copper, maize and tobacco. The amount of copper produced or made available for sale is regulated in order to help balance the world supply and demand position of this commodity.

Local industrial products include steel and metal work, cement, soap, furniture, oxygen and acetylene, clothing and blankets, boat building, plastics, and car batteries. There are also in operation an iron-foundry, saw-mills, a recently established pottery, a brewery, a sweet factory, and a sugar refinery. New construction and development continue at a high rate in the mining industry, and Government has made considerable provision in its £30 million Development Plan to assist the development of agriculture in rural areas from a subsistence basis towards commercial operation in a cash economy.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

Co-operative Societies have again enjoyed a successful year in 1962 and the agricultural co-operative marketing sector has continued to progress in spite of a fall in both the price of maize and the export price of F.A.Q. groundnuts. This fall in prices is reflected in the reduced turnover of £7,219,958 compared with £8,453,252 in 1961.

There were ten dissolutions during the year and nine new registrations, leaving a total of 227 societies with a European and African aggregate membership of 35,619. Paid up share capital and deposits amounted to £579,759.

Co-operative Marketing organisations handled 841,646 bags of maize (200 lb. bags), 165,365 bags of groundnuts (180 lb. bags) and 3,744 bags of other produce (200 lb. bags) plus 3,447 lbs. of cotton at a total value of £2,348,023. In addition 9,081,486 lbs. of tobacco was marketed at a value of £1,571,082.

Societies also continued to handle milk, cheese, butter, cream, eggs, coffee and cattle.
