MAURITIUS

Area
The area of Mauritius is approximately 720 square miles, that of Rodrigues 40 square miles and the area of the Lesser Dependencies, viz., the Chagos Archipelago (the largest islet is Diego Garcia), Agalega and the Cargados Carajos or St. Brandon Isles, approximately 47½ square miles.

Population
The estimated population at 31st December 1962 was: Mauritius 692,350, Rodrigues 18,650, Lesser Dependencies 1,100; divided approximately into: (1) general population, comprising Europeans and descendants of Europeans and people of African and mixed origin, 31%; (2) Indo-Mauritians, made up of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent and their descendants, 66%; and Chinese, consisting of immigrants from China and their descendants, 3%.

Principal Towns
At the *31st December 1962 the estimated population of the principal towns was:—

| Town                        | Population |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| Port Louis (capital)        | 90,375     |

* Based on the 1962 Population Census.

Geographical Features
The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them are navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. Some of the larger waterfalls have been harnessed to supply hydro-electric power. The land rises gradually from the coasts and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Remnants of the native forests of the island cover some 15,000 acres.

Climate
The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The mean temperature varies from 23°C. at sea level to 19°C. at 2,000 feet. The highest and lowest values ever recorded at Pamplemousses at 180 feet are 35°C. and 10°C. and at Vacoas, at 1,394 feet on the western slopes, are 37°C. and 8°C.

Rainfall differs considerably according to the height above sea level. On the highest part of the central plateau an average of 200 inches falls each year but amounts decrease rapidly to 60 and 35 inches on the windward and leeward coasts. There is no marked dry season but in the three months from September to November rainfall is about one quarter of the fall in the three wettest months, January to March.

Tropical cyclones may occur between September and May but by far the greatest frequency is in January and February; March and April are also important months owing to the greater susceptibility to damage of the grown sugar cane. In about 10% of all years, mean wind speed over an hour reaches 50 m.p.h. and gusts 100 m.p.h.; gusts of 80 m.p.h. may be expected about 25 times every century.

History
Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. Settlements were established from 1638 onwards but did not prosper and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French. A small first contingent of colonists was sent in 1721 from the neighbouring island of Réunion (then called Bourbon), but it was not actually occupied until 1722 when a small party of colonists was sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Constitution
The Government is vested in a Governor with a Council of Ministers and a Legislative Assembly. The Mauritius (Constitution) Order 1964 provides for a Legislative Assembly consisting of the Speaker (elected by the Assembly from among its members, other than members who are members of the Council of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries) one ex-officio member (the Chief Secretary), 40 elected members and such nominated members not exceeding 15 in number as the Governor may appoint.

The Colony is divided into 40 single-member constituencies and every person (male or female) has the right to vote who:—

(a) is a British subject of the age of 21 years or upwards; and

(b) has resided in the Colony for a period of at least two years immediately before the date of registration or is domiciled in the Colony and is residing therein at that date; and

(c) has resided in the constituency in which he is entitled to be registered as a voter for a period of at least six months immediately before the date of registration.
The Council of Ministers consists of the Premier, the Chief Secretary and not less than ten nor more than thirteen appointed members. The Governor acting in his discretion appoints as Premier a member of the Legislative Assembly who appears to the Governor likely to command the support of the majority of members of that Assembly. The appointed members of the Council are persons who are elected or nominated members of the Legislative Assembly and are appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Premier. The Governor may, after consultation with the Premier, appoint such persons from among the elected or nominated members of the Legislative Assembly as he may deem expedient to be Parliamentary Secretaries. The members of the Council and the Parliamentary Secretaries are responsible to the Governor and to the Legislative Assembly for all matters affecting the department with which they are associated.

Land Policy

Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unconceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) "Pas Geometriques" being reserved land lying on the sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81·21 metres. Alienable Crown lands may be sold only by public auction, except in the case of lands required for religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for public utility, when a nominal price is charged. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands and "Pas Geometriques" may be leased by private contract or public auction.

The remaining five-sixths of the area of the island are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.

Taxation

Income tax rates for individuals are:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax |
|-------------------|------------|
| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10 cents |
| For every rupee of the next : Rs. 5,000 | 15 cents |
| Rs. 5,000 | 20 cents |
| Rs. 5,000 | 30 cents |
| Rs. 5,000 | 40 cents |
| Rs. 10,000 | 50 cents |
| Rs. 15,000 | 60 cents |

For every rupee of the remainder of the chargeable income 70 cents

In ascertaining the chargeable income a number of deductions are allowed.

Company tax is at the rate of 40%.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

Queen Elizabeth II of Rs.1,000 (legal tender between banks and Government only), Rs.25, Rs.10 and Rs.5; cupro-nickel coins of R.1, 50 cents, 25 cents and 10 cents and bronze coins of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The fixed rate of exchange is 1s. 6d. to the rupee.

Development Plans

The current Five-Year Reconstruction and Development Programme for the period 1st July 1960 to 30th June 1965 is estimated to cost Rs.354 million.

The main sources of finance envisaged for the new Programme are set out below:

| Source of Finance | Rs.m |
|-------------------|------|
| Local resources | 158·1 |
| Colonial Development and Welfare funds (other than Central Housing Authority) | 17·2 |
| Loans and Grants from Colonial Services Vote (other than Central Housing Authority) | 28·7 |
| Loans and Grants from H.M.G. for Central Housing Authority | 72·2 |
| Potential assistance from external sources | 60 |

Total = 336·2
On the above figures there remains a gap of Rs. 17·8 million, part of which may be financed under the proposed extensions of the 1959 Colonial Development and Welfare Act and part of which will be covered by potential under-expenditure within the planning period. The provision of Rs. 72·2 million for the Central Housing Programme includes a grant of Rs. 6·7 million from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds: the total Colonial Development and Welfare provision is therefore Rs.23·9 million, excluding any further provision under the extension of the 1959 Act.

The projected expenditure can be broken down into five main sectors:

| Sector                  | Rs.m |
|-------------------------|------|
| Economic Services       | 55·2 |
| Infra-Structure         | 112·2|
| Social Services         | 66   |
| Cyclone reconstruction  | 99   |
| Miscellaneous           | 21·6 |
| **Total**               | **354·0** |

**Education**

On 31st October 1962 there were 834 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 367 were pre-primary schools, 257 primary schools, 105 secondary, two post-secondary and two Central Schools, one Technical Institute and Trade Centre, with a total of 165,093 pupils. The Government institutions comprised 124 primary schools, two central schools, four secondary schools, one training college for teachers, one post-secondary College of Agriculture and one Technical Institute. Thirteen secondary and 75 primary schools within the total given were State-aided; eight of the State-aided secondary schools had primary sections. There were also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The Government awarded six scholarships in 1962 for higher education overseas. Mauritian students overseas numbered 1,080, of whom 855 were in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities, 100 in France and 95 in India and Pakistan, ten in the United States and Canada, eight in Switzerland and twelve in other countries.

Adult education courses provide for post-primary and post-secondary education in Science, Handwork, Art, Typewriting, Book-keeping, Secretarial Training, “Builders Quantities”, Economics, Local Government, Telecommunications Mathematics, Telecommunications Practice, Technical Drawing, English Language and Electrical Engineering courses for apprentices.

In the financial year 1962–63 expenditure on education is estimated at Rs. 22·6 million (excluding capital expenditure on new buildings and other development works which cost Rs.2·2 million). In 1935 expenditure was Rs.1,347,201.

**Libraries and Museums**

There are seven Libraries:—(i) Police Library, Port Louis, (ii) Municipality of Port Louis Library, (iii) Town Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill Library, (iv) Carnegie Library, Curepipe, (v) Mauritius Institute Library, Port Louis, (vi) British Council Library, Rose Hill, (vii) Urban Council of Quatre Bornes Library.

The Natural History Museum, Port Louis, and the Historical Museum, Mahebourg, are both run by the Mauritius Institute. A small art gallery is also annexed to the Port Louis Museum.

**Health**

The vaccination of babies with D.P.T. Polio (Quadruple Vaccine) from Canada, inaugurated in 1960, has become a regular feature.

Alterations and improvements to hospitals have continued throughout the year.

The infantile mortality rate (60·1), and the death rate (9·3) are the lowest on record.

Help from the W.H.O. continued in respect of the scheme for the eradication of Malaria and Tuberculosis.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 13 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1962 was 1,566 in general hospitals, of which 205 were in Orthopaedic wards, 141 in Maternity wards and 213 in Tuberculosis wards. There were 780 beds at the Mental Hospital, 61 at the Leper Asylum, 46 in the Prison hospitals and 55 at the Emergency T.B. Hospital. In addition, 25 sugar estates provide each a small hospital with a total of 500 beds for the sole benefit of their employees. There were also five private nursing homes, 50 static dispensaries and out-patient departments of hospitals (excluding two out-patient departments of hospitals and two dispensaries in the prisons) and four mobile dental clinics. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provides 29 static centres and one mobile ante-natal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 37,054; attendances at static dispensaries numbered 1,260,307 and at mobile dispensaries 118,817.

The expenditure on medical services during the financial year 1961–62 amounted to Rs.17,426,995·94 against an actual expenditure of Rs.1,964,369 in 1929–30.

**Communications**

The airport (Plaisance) is operated and managed by the Colonial Government. Air France with “Super Constellation” aircraft operates a scheduled service thrice weekly between Reunion and Madagascar whence connections to Europe and other points can be made. British Overseas Airways Corporation provide a weekly Comet IV service between London and Mauritius via Rome—Khartoum—Nairobi. A weekly service between Australia and South Africa is operated on alternate weeks by Quantas Empire Airways with “Electra” and South African Airways with DC7B aircraft, the route being Sydney—Melbourne—Perth—Cocos—Mauritius—Johannesburg. (S.A.A. do not serve the first two points.) Rhodesian Air Services operate a fortnightly direct service between Salisbury and Mauritius with DC 4 aircraft. No internal services exist.

The railway carried 470,365 metric tons of freight in 1961–62. Track mileage totalled 68 miles on 30th June, 1962.

There are in the Colony about 525·5 miles of main roads, 232 miles of branch roads and 63 miles of streets in villages and extra-urban areas; 543·5 miles of main and branch roads, streets in villages and extra urban areas have been asphalted.

Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate ten ocean-going vessels at any one time and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the British and Commonwealth Shipping Company and from continental...
ports by the French companies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie. Havraise Peninsulaire; the Scindia Steamships Company provide a regular cargo service from Bombay and the O.S.K. Line provide a regular monthly cargo service from Japan and the Far East. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Interocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East-South Africa-South America service, to and from South Africa. During 1962, 519 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total of 1,543,336 net tons.

Broadcasting

Government runs the Mauritius Broadcasting Service, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station at Malherbes operates on 439 metres, 683 kc/s medium wave and 30-90 metres and 61-86 metres, 9,710 and 4,850 kc/s with powers of 10 kW in both cases. In June 1963 there were 53,452 wireless licences in force in the Colony with an estimate of five listeners per receiver.

Principal Occupations

Cane plantation and sugar manufacture give employment to approximately 5,300 skilled and 54,000 semi-skilled and unskilled workers. Other Agricultural industries are cultivation of tea, employing some 2,100 workers; tobacco 1,300; aloe fibre 450. About 6,300 workers are in known employment in manufacturing, 4,700 in construction, 2,600 in electricity services and communications, and 22,500 in services, including central and local government but not domestic and hotel services.

In 1962 there were 75 registered trade unions including ten associations of employers and two federations of trade unions with 36 members. Total membership of the employees' unions was 39,526.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are sugar-cane, "aloe" (Furcraea) fibre, tea and tobacco. Sugar is produced in 23 factories which have been to a large measure re-equipped with up-to-date machinery in the recent years. Practically all the aloe fibre produced is spun locally and turned into bags for the sugar industry. Tea is being encouraged and the production was roughly 2,800,000 lbs. in 1962, about 1,000,000 lbs. of which were sold locally and the rest exported.

The tobacco produced is blended with imported leaves in the proportion of three to one for the manufacture of cigarettes for local consumption. Of the by-products of sugar cane 110,253 metric tons of molasses were exported and 16,534 hectolitres of high strength alcohol were produced.

The Livestock population is estimated to be roughly: 'creole' milch breed cattle, 44,000; Zebu type, beef herd cattle, 1,500; goats, 54,000; pigs, 5,000; sheep, 100; rabbits, 8,000; poultry and other birds, 415,000.

The catch of fish in territorial waters is approximately 2,000 tons a year of which 1,500 are landed at Controlled Stations.
