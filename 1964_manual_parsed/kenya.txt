KENYA

The Constitution providing for internal self-government in Kenya was introduced on the 1st June, 1963. It was agreed in June that, subject to the necessary steps being completed in time, Kenya would become independent on 12th December. This was confirmed during the Conference held in London in September and October, 1963, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and Kenya attained independence and became a member of the Commonwealth on 12th December, 1963.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is now the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and Her Majesty's Government in Kenya.

Basic information about Kenya can be found in the 1963 edition of the Colonial Office List.
