ZANZIBAR

Zanzibar became internally self-governing on the 24th June, 1963. Following a Conference held in London in September 1963 under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Zanzibar attained independence on 10th December 1963, and became a member of the Commonwealth.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is now the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of Zanzibar.

Basic information about Zanzibar can be found in the 1963 edition of the Colonial Office List.
