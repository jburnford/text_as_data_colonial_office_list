NEW BRUNSWICK.

This province is the eastern division of the continent of North America; it is situated between 45° 5' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 47' and 67° 53' W. long.; its area is about 26,000 square miles, or 17,000,000 acres. This Colony is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus.

New Brunswick in the early part of the last century belonged to the French, and was called by them New France; it was first colonized by British subjects in 1761, and in 1783 by disbanded troops from New England. At the peace of 1763, New Brunswick, with the rest of Canada, was ceded by France to Great Britain, from which period to 1785 it was annexed to Nova Scotia, when it was erected into a separate Colony.
The surface of this province is broken and undulating, but not mountainous; it is traversed by many fine rivers, the principal of which is the St. John's. The river St. Croix divides this province from Maine in the United States.

Coal is abundant and is worked by a joint-stock company; iron and gypsum are to be found also in considerable quantities. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests, and the cutting and exporting the timber, which is very fine, furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, and oats, are the principal cereals raised.

The climate is very similar to that of Canada. Winter lasts from November to April.

The Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council of nine members, a Legislative Council of 22 members, and a House of Assembly of 40 members.

Vote by Ballot.

The property qualification for those elected is possession for six months previous to issue of writ of freehold estate in land, situated in the province unencumbered of the value of 300l. For electors, possession of real or personal estate of the value of 25l.
