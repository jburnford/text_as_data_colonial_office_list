SOUTH AUSTRALIA.

The boundaries of this Colony, according to the Statutes of 4 and 5 Wm. cap. 95, are fixed between 132° and 141° E. long. for the eastern and western boundaries, the 26° of S. lat. for the northern limit, and it is bounded on the south by the Southern Ocean. All the islands on the coast-line are included in the colonial territory. The coastline of South Australia extends about 1,600 miles, making in all an area of some 300,000 square miles. Adelaide,* the capital of the Colony, is situated on the eastern shores of St. Vincent's Gulf, in S. lat. 34° 57', E. long. 138° 38', about five miles from the seashore. Port Adelaide is an inlet from St. Vincent's Gulf, and is six miles north-west of Adelaide. South Australia was first colonized in 1836 by emigrants from Great Britain, sent out under the auspices of a Company called the South Australian Colonization Association, who in 1835 obtained a grant from the Imperial Government of the lands of this Colony. The conditions were that the land should not be sold at less than 1l. per acre; that the revenue arising from the sale

* The boundaries of the Colony have since been extended under the authority of Royal Letters Patent, dated 6th day of July, 1863, so as to embrace all the territory lying northward of 36° 50' S. latitude and between the 129th and 138th degrees of East longitude.
of such lands should be appropriated to the emigration of agricultural labourers; that the control of the Company's affairs should be vested in a body of Commissioners approved by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that the Governor of the Colony should be nominated by the Crown. Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., was appointed first Governor, and arrived in the Colony on the 26th December, 1836.

The constitution of this Colony was remodelled in 1856, and the Government is now administered by the Governor and an Executive Council of five members, who constitute the responsible Ministry, and are required to be Members of Parliament, viz., Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Treasurer, Commissioner of Crown Lands, and Commissioner of Public Works. The Parliament consists of a Legislative Council and an Assembly. The Legislative Council consists of eighteen members, elected by the inhabitants of the Colony legally qualified to vote; one-third retiring by rotation every four years, and six new members being elected to the vacancies so created. The qualification consists in being thirty years of age, and a natural born or naturalized subject of her Majesty, and having resided in the Colony for upwards of three years.

The qualification of electors is full age and a natural born or naturalized subject of her Majesty, possession of a freehold estate of 50l. annual value, or a leasehold estate of the clear annual value of 20l., or occupation of a dwelling-house of 25l. annual value.

The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, elected by the inhabitants of the several districts of the Colony for three years. (Vide Act No. 20 of 1861.) Any person qualified to vote in or for any electoral district is qualified and entitled to be elected Member of Assembly. Aliens are not eligible until after a residence of five years. Every natural born or naturalized subject of full age who has been registered upon the Electoral Roll of any district shall be qualified to vote in the election of Members of Assembly. There are 24,816 registered electors. One-third of the members is sufficient to constitute a meeting of the Assembly.

In 1865 the total area of land under cultivation amounted to 660,000 acres; there were 3,780,000 sheep and 158,000 horned cattle depastured. The year's export of wool reached 19,000,000 lbs., valued at 975,000l. Fifty-four mines, chiefly copper, were being worked. There were 6,629 acres of vineyard under cultivation, and 1,000,000 gallons of wine were manufactured in the year. The aboriginal population amounted to 4,397 persons.
