STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

SINGAPORE, PENANG, AND MALACCA.

The Straits Settlements, which will be transferred by Order in Council authorized by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, from the control of the India Office to that of the Colonial Department, comprise Singapore, Penang, or Prince of Wales Island, including Province Wellesley, and Malacca. The date of transfer is fixed for the 1st April, 1867.

Singapore was first occupied by the British early in 1819, when its only inhabitants were a few hundred Malay fishermen and pirates. The original treaty between Sir Stamford Raffles and the Sultan and the Tumongong of Johore, the Malay sovereigns of the island provided only for the establishment of a factory, within prescribed limits, for which they were to receive 5,000 dollars annually; but after the objections made by the Dutch to our establishing ourselves on the island had been withdrawn in the treaty of 1824, a new treaty was concluded by Mr. Crawfurd with the same native authorities, by which the whole island of Singapore and numerous adjacent islets were ceded in absolute property and sovereignty to the East India Company. This treaty provides for the payment of 33,200 dollars to the Sultan, and of 26,800 dollars to the Tumongong, together with a stipend for life to the former of 1,300 dollars a month, and to the latter of 700 dollars a month.

Singapore, which can scarcely be said to be within the Straits of Malacca, is situated at their southern extremity, and is separated by a very narrow, but navigable strait, from the most southerly part of the Malayan Peninsula. Exclusive of the smaller islands attached to it, it contains an area of about 206 square miles, and the town lies in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' 47" east. It is distant about 360 miles from Penang.

From the time of its cession until 1805, Penang was subordinate to Bengal, and the Government was administered first by a Superintendent, and afterwards by a Lieutenant-Governor. In that year it was raised to the rank of an Indian Presidency, under a Governor and Council, and its relations with the home authorities and the Supreme Government of India were the same as those of Bombay and Madras.

Penang was ceded to the East India Company by the Rajah of Quedah, or Kedah, in 1786, when its only inhabitants were a few Malay fishermen; and in 1800, the slip of territory on the opposite coast, separated from the island of Penang by a strait a little more than two miles in breadth, was obtained from the same Malay ruler, and has since formed part of the settlement of Penang, under the name of Province Wellesley. These acquisitions of territory were made the subject of a formal treaty, one of the principal conditions of which was that the East India Company should pay annually to the Rajah of Quedah, the sum of 10,000 dollars as long as they remained in possession.

The Island of Penang is situated at the northern entrance of the Straits of Malacca, the capital, George Town, being in lat. 5° 24' 15" north, and in long. 100° 21' east. It is 13½ miles long, varying in breadth from 10 to 5½ miles, and contains an area of 68,400 acres. Province Wellesley lies on the mainland, immediately opposite, running north and south 25 miles, and of very unequal breadth, as it varies from 3½ to 11 miles, and its estimated area is 151,000 acres.

Malacca, which was first captured by the Portuguese in 1511, and taken from them by the Dutch in 1640, fell into our hands in 1795, and remained (with the exception of a short interval following on the Peace of Amiens) in our occupation until 1818, in which year it was reclaimed possession of by the Dutch, in terms of the treaty of Vienna of 1814. It was finally given up to us in 1825, pursuant to the treaty of March, 1824, with the Government of the Netherlands.

Malacca also forms part of the mainland of the Malayan Peninsula, along the western coast of which it stretches in a north-westerly and south-easterly direction 43 miles, lying between lat. 2° and 2° 30' north, extending inland in some directions 28 miles, and in others only 10 miles. The town of Malacca, which is pretty nearly equidistant from the north-west and south-east extremities of the territory, is distant about 100 miles from Singapore and 260 miles from Penang.

After its transfer to us in 1825, Malacca was governed by a Resident, subject to the authorities at Penang.

The affairs of Singapore were administered by Sir Stamford Raffles, as Lieutenant-Governor of Fort Marlborough, or Bencoolen, with a Resident as chief local functionary, until 1823, when it was placed under Bengal.

In 1-26, Malacca and Singapore were united to Penang, and the three stations were formed into one settlement, under one government, consisting of a Governor or President, with a resident councillor at each station as the chief local authority, under the designation of "The Settlement of Prince of Wales Island, Singapore, and Malacca," still continuing to constitute an Indian Presidency.

In 1830, during the administration of Lord William Bentinck, as Governor-General of India, the Presidency was abolished, and the three stations were placed under the Government of Bengal, with a change in the designation of the authorities from Governor or President, and Resident Councillor, to that of commissioner and deputy residents. Owing, however, to the provisions of the letters patent, or charter, for the administration of justice in the Straits, it was found necessary, shortly afterwards, to restore the former designations of Governor and Resident Councillor, but the administration of the incorporated settlements was still continued under the control of the Government of Bengal until 1852, when it was placed in direct correspondence with the Supreme Government of India.

The form of government which is about to be instituted may be said to assimilate closely to that in force in the prosperous Colony of Ceylon.

It will consist of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council: the latter body will comprise 6 official members and 4 unofficial members, two of whom will represent Singapore, and the other two, Penang and Malacca respectively.

The Governor is to visit Penang for three months, and Malacca for one month in every year. The troops stationed in the island will be a wing of an European Regiment, 6 companies of Ceylon Rifles, and 2 batteries of Artillery. Of these, 880 men are to be considered as stationed in the settlements exclusively for colonial purposes. The Colonial Military Contribution will be 59,300£ per annum.
The Straits Settlements were early made use of by the Government of India as penal stations for the reception of criminals transported from Continental India, and a large body of convicts was distributed throughout the three stations, and continued to increase, until, consequent on the complaints of the inhabitants, an Act of the Legislative Council of India was passed in 1860, prohibiting the further transportation of convicted offenders from the Indian Presidencies to the Straits.

In Penang and Province Wellesley, the Malay race predominates, the proportion being equal to nearly two Malays out of every three inhabitants. The Chinese rank next, and constitute about a fourth of the whole population; the remainder being made up of Europeans and their descendants, natives of the Madras and Coromandel coasts (called Chulias and Klingis), Burmese, Siamese, Bengalees, &c.

In Malacca also the Malays form the chief part of the population, and in still greater proportion than in Penang and Province Wellesley, as their numbers amount to about three-fourths of the whole. Here also the Chinese are found in the next greatest number, forming about a sixth of the inhabitants, whilst Europeans and their descendants, native born Portuguese, natives of India, Arabs, &c., make up the rest. There is this difference between the two other stations and Malacca, that in the latter, the inhabitants are mostly natives of the soil, the different classes adhering closely to the religion, manners, and customs of the countries to which their ancestors originally belonged, though the Malay language is common to all and universally used. The Chinese colonists of Malacca are distinguished in the Straits by the appellation of Baba, and include some of the most wealthy and perhaps the most intelligent Chinese merchants in the Straits, many of whom reside and carry on their trade at Singapore.

The population of Singapore is more varied in its composition, and the Chinese are by far the most numerous section of the inhabitants.

**Population, 1862.**

|                |       |
|----------------|-------|
| Singapore      | 81,732|
| Penang         | 124,772|
| Malacca        | 76,267|

282,831

The Straits ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are any tonnage dues whatever levied, and the only tax or duty to which shipping entering the port is liable, consists of a very moderate one, of 3 cents or 1½d. per register ton, in support of aids to navigation, by contributing to the maintenance of the Horsburgh and Raffles Light-houses at the eastern and western entrances to the roads of Singapore, and a floating light about the middle of the Straits of Malacca.

The united exports and imports of the three Colonies in 1859-60 were as follow:

|                |       |
|----------------|-------|
| Singapore      | £10,371,300|
| Penang         | 3,530,000|
| Malacca        | 920,000|

The exports comprise: gutta, gambier, black pepper, gum elastic, buffalo horns, rattans, canes, tin, sugar, rice, sago, tea, coffee, opium, timber, &c., &c.

The total taxes raised in the settlements in 1859-60 were—

|                |       |
|----------------|-------|
| Singapore      | £86,505|
| Penang         | 35,638|
| Malacca        | 18,339|

£140,482

The rate of taxation a head which these figures give is,—for Singapore, 2½s. 1½d.; for Penang, ¾s. 8½d.; and for Malacca, 4s. 9½d. The average for the three Colonies gives nearly 10s., which is about double the rate in the British continental possessions, even including the opium tax of 5,000,000l., which is paid, not by our own subjects, but by strangers. In Singapore the rate of taxation is fourfold what it is in Continental India.

The sources from which the revenue is raised are alike in all the three stations. They consist chiefly of the monopoly, or exclusive privilege, of preparing and retailing opium for smoking, the sale of spirits, and other excisable commodities, which is farmed out to private individuals, all Chinese, and disposed of annually at public auction. The revenue derivable from the land is inconsiderable, and is composed of the proceeds of sales of public lands, quit rents, fees on transfer, &c. Judicial fines and fees, the post office, and a few miscellaneous items, make up the remainder.

The amount of revenue for the three several stations, during the last few years, is shown in the following statements:

|                | SINGAPORE. | PENANG. | MALACCA. |
|----------------|------------|---------|----------|
|                | £          | £       | £        |
| 1855-56        | 59,636     | 26,377  | 17,173   |
| 1856-57        | 67,856     | 30,491  | 17,994   |
| 1857-58        | 77,031     | 31,952  | 17,260   |
| 1858-59        | 84,368     | 30,421  | 17,253   |

The Revenue and Expenditure of the three stations together, speaking roughly, have been, since 1859:

|                | Revenue. | Expenditure. |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
|                | £        | £            |
| 1859-60        | 125,425  | 158,697      |
| 1861-2         | 174,560  | 194,060      |
| 1862-3         | 186,500  | 200,060*     |
| 1863-4         | 211,000  | 203,000*     |
| 1864-5         | 213,000  | 214,900*     |
| 1865-6         | 212,565  | 233,220*     |

The Stamp Tax produces between 25,000l. and 26,000l. per annum.
