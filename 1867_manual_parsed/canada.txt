CANADA.

Canada is said to have been discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497; but this is not certain. The French are also said to have turned their attention to this part of the world in 1508; at any rate, in 1525, they took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days, and for a considerable time after, the French were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris of that year.

This vast territory, situated in North America, lies principally in a N.E. and S.W. direction along the north side of the St. Lawrence and the north and east sides of lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior, between 59° 50' and 9° W. long., and 42° and 52° N. lat.: the other portion lies on the south side of the river St. Lawrence, from which it stretches from near Montreal to Point Gaspé at its embouchure. Canada is here bounded on the south by the territories of the United States and New Brunswick.

Total area in square miles is 331,280, being 121,260 for Upper Canada, and 210,020 for Lower Canada.

During the French ascendancy, Canada was governed by military authority; and on its cession to Great Britain in 1763 till 1791 it was governed by a Governor appointed by the Crown of England, aided by a Council also appointed by the same authority.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III, cap. 31), establishing a constitution for the two Provinces into which Canada was by that Act divided. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act of Parliament alluded to, the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. This constitution was suspended in consequence of the rebellion in Upper Canada in 1838, and a Special Council appointed.

In 1840 the two Provinces were reunited (by an Act 3rd & 4th Vic. cap. 35), and the Legislative Councils of the united Provinces were consolidated: this new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it has in fact exceeded double that number), the members were appointed for life. Whilst the House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal proportion returned by either Province. In the same year (1840) also Municipal Institutions were established in Canada.

The Provincial Legislature is empowered by Act 17 & 18 Vict. cap. 118 (1854), to constitute the Legislative Council an elective body.

The constitution of Canada now in operation is defined in its main features under title I. of the Consol. Stat. 1859. Under these Acts Canada is divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consists of 48 members, who are elected, and 22 members who were nominated under the old constitution. The Council will ultimately consist of 48 elective members.

The qualifications required in Nominated Councillors related only to age and nationality. They hold their seats for life, subject to voluntary resignation, and in certain cases to forfeiture.

Of the 48 elected members, 24 are for Upper Canada and 24 for Lower. They were arranged in four sets, and were chosen respectively in
Representative Councillors hold their seats eight years, subject to resignation or forfeiture. There is thus a biennial election of 12 Councillors. The qualification for a Councillor is that he must be a British subject, thirty years of age, possess real property in the province, and unencumbered, of the value of $8,000 dollars. The qualification of electors are the same as those of electors of the House of Assembly—viz., every male subject, being the owner or occupier or tenant of real property of the assessed value of $300 dollars, or of the yearly value of $30 dollars if situated within the municipal limits of city or town; but of the assessed value of $200 dollars, or yearly value of $20 dollars if not so situated. A considerable section of the civil service, together with election employés, is disabled from voting.

The elected must have (3 & 4 Vic. c. 45 sec. 28) real property situated in Canada, unencumbered, of the value of $500l. of sterling money of Great Britain.

The duration of the Legislative Council is independent of that of the House of Assembly, which is for four years, unless the Assembly is sooner dissolved.

The Governor is styled "Governor-General of British North America."
