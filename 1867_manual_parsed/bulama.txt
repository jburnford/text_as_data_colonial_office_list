BULAMA.

The Island of Bulama is situated at the entrance of the two large rivers Jeba and Rio Grande, but nearer the latter than the former. Its distance from the Gambia is 250 miles, and from Sierra Leone 350 miles. Ground nuts, beeswax, gum, copal, and rough rice are the principal articles of export; and on the banks of the Rio Grande there are numerous mahogany trees. The Island is a dependency of Sierra Leone, and was ceded to the British Government in 1732.
