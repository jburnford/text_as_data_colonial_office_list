TASMANIA.

Tasmania, or Van Diemen's Land, is an island in the South Pacific Ocean off the southern extremity of Australia, from which it is separated by Bass's Strait; it is situated between 41° 20' and 43° 40' S. lat., and 144° 40' and 148° 20' E. long. Tasmania is 170 miles from north to south, and 160 miles from east to west; it contains 15,232,000 acres of land.

This island was originally discovered by Tasman in 1642; it was afterwards partially explored by Cook. The first penal settlement formed there was in 1803, and till 1813 it was merely a place for transportation from Great Britain and from New South Wales, of which Colony it was a dependency. Transportation to New South Wales having ceased in the year 1841, Tasmania, to which had been annexed Norfolk Island, became the only Colony to which criminals from Great Britain were sent; but this ceased in 1853, when transportation to Tasmania was abolished.
The following brief outline will give an idea of the general character of the country:

About 40 miles from the west, and the same distance from the North Coast, a table land about 1½ million acres in extent rises about 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. On this elevated land are numerous lakes, which form the heads of the principal streams, flowing to the South, the West, and the North; and from it a spur or mountain range runs in a direction a little to the East of South, and, separating the valley of the Derwent from that of the Gordon and Huon Rivers, has hitherto proved an almost impassable barrier to the progress of the population towards the West Coast.

A mountainous range of less decided character, and broken through at one point by the valley of the South Esk, separates the central and more settled districts from those on the East Coast.

The principal part of the population of the island is thus, at present, confined to a narrow strip of land between these two ranges of hills.

Hobart Town is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1865) 24,773 inhabitants, and 27 places of worship. The city has been much improved of late years by the addition of several handsome public buildings. Gas is laid on in all the streets, and a water-supply on the high pressure principle proves a source of the greatest convenience and health to the inhabitants. The town is beautifully situated on rising ground, commanding a view of the harbour, which affords safe shelter at all times to vessels of the largest size. The new Government House, which is situated on the banks of the Derwent, in the Queen's Park, is one of the finest buildings in Australia, and presents a noble appearance from the bay.

Launceston, the second town of the colony, contains a population of 10,359 persons. During the last few years many improvements have been effected by the erection of public buildings, churches, and a mechanics' institute, and the establishment of ornamental gardens and squares. The water supply is abundant, and the streets are lighted with gas. There is a considerable trade in grain and other produce between this place, Melbourne, and New Zealand.

The climate is considered healthy and well suited to European constitutions; the winters are cold, but the country rarely suffers from the continued droughts which prevail in the neighbouring continent.

The Constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17): by this Act a Legislative Council and House of Assembly are constituted, called the "Parliament of Van Diemen's Land."

The Legislative Council consists of fifteen members, elected for twelve electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat shall be vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council; 23 Vict. cap. 43, The qualification of members is thirty years of age, and a natural born or naturalized subject. The qualification for electors is the possession of a freehold estate of 50l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty elected members, and there are twenty-four electoral districts. Any natural born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court or minister of religion. The duration of the Assembly is five years. The qualification of electors for the Assembly is property of the value of 100l. in the district for which he votes, or household property of the annual value of 10l.; or being a barrister or solicitor on the roll of the Supreme Court, or legally qualified medical practitioner, or minister of religion, &c., &c., resident for twelve months before election in the district. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict. cap. 32.

The Governor, who is appointed by the Crown, is aided by a Cabinet of responsible ministers.
Succession of Lieutenant-Governors, and other Officers administering the Government of Tasmania, since the Foundation on 16th February, 1804.
