VANCOUVER'S ISLAND.

The island is about to be included in the government of British Columbia. It lies off the N.W. coast of North America, between N. lat. 48° 20' and 50° 55', and W. long. 123° 10' and 128° 20', having an extreme length of 275 miles, and a breadth varying from 40 to 50 miles. It is separated from the mainland by a channel, called in various parts by the names of Queen Charlotte's Sound, Johnstone Strait, and Gulf of Georgia. On the south it is divided from the Washington territory by the Juan de Fuca Strait. Its area has been roughly estimated at 16,000 square miles.

This island was originally supposed to form part of the Continent of North America, or New Albion, as it was then called. In April, 1792, Captain George Vancouver of the Royal Navy entered the straits of Fuca, and, surveying and exploring as he proceeded, passed into the ocean by a passage considerably to the northward, and arrived at Nootka Sound in August of the same year, having thus circumnavigated the land, and determined its separate existence as an island. He named it the island of Quadra and Vancouver out of compliment to Senor Quadra, the Spanish Commandant at Nootka. The former name has, however, fallen into desuetude, and the island is now generally known and recognized as Vancouver's Island.

The capital of the island is Victoria, situated at its south-eastern extremity, a flourishing town of 7,000 inhabitants. The number of the aborigines has been estimated at about 17,000.

The first British Settlement in Vancouver's Island was made at Nootka Sound, on the N.W. coast, about the year 1778, by some London merchants, whose intention it was to dispose there of the produce raised in China.

Till 1849, Vancouver's Island was only occasionally resorted to by the servants of the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Companies; but in that year a lease of the island was granted to the former Company for 10 years. The Imperial Government, however, reserved to itself the right of resuming it at the expiration of this period, on certain conditions. Accordingly, in 1859 it was made a British Colony; Mr. Douglas, who had acted as Governor under the Hudson's Bay Company, was confirmed in that appointment. The Governor is assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council, nominated by the Crown, and by an Assembly of 15 Members, elected by inhabitants possessed of a 12l. rental; or a freehold of 20 acres of land, or of the value of 50l.

This form of Government will cease on the incorporation of Vancouver's Island with British Columbia, which will date from the issue of a proclamation in conformity with the provisions of the Imperial Act.

It would be useless to give the names of the officers formerly serving under the Government, as they are probably being amalgamated with the Civil Service of British Columbia, and we can give no accurate return of the changes in offices and office-holders.
