TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

These islands were formerly included among the Bahama group, from which they were separated in 1848 by Act of the Bahama Legislature. The following is an extract from that Act:—“The Islands of Grand and Salt Cay, together with the small islands and Cays immediately adjacent thereto, and which, together with the said Islands of Grand and Salt Cay, are commonly known and designated as ‘The Turks’ Islands,’ and the Islands and Cays, commonly known and designated as the ‘Caicos Islands,’ together with all the banks and Cays, situate, lying, and being to the eastward of the said Turks’ Islands and Caicos Islands, and comprised within, or deemed part of, or appertaining to, Your Majesty’s Bahama Islands, shall cease to be component parts of the Bahama Government,” &c.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 30' W. long.

The Government is administered by a President, who is subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica, and a Council composed of nominees and four elected members. All taxpayers who are able to read and write have the privilege of voting at elections. There are 250 registered electors, who return three members for the Turks Island and one for the Caicos Island. The election of members is regulated by Ordinances 1 and 3 of 1858.
