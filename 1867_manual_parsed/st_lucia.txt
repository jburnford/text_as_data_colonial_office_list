ST. LUCIA.

The Island of St. Lucia was discovered by Columbus, during his fourth voyage, on the 15th June, 1502. It is situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 60° 58' W. long.; at a distance of 24 miles to the south-east of Martinique and 21 to the north-east of St. Vincent. It is 42 miles in length and 21 at its greatest breadth; its circumference is one hundred and fifty miles, and its area 158,620 acres. Near its northern extremity lies Pigeon Island, formerly a military post of some importance.

Castries, the capital of the island, is situated at the bottom of a deep bay of the same name, and contains about 900 houses and a population of about 3,500 souls. Next in importance is the town of Soufriere, containing a population of 1,800 souls.

At the period of its discovery St. Lucia was inhabited by the Caribs, and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to Messrs. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1639 the English formed their first settlement, but in the following year the colonists were all murdered by the Caribs.

In 1642, the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it for 1,600l. to Messrs. Honel and Duparquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a Treaty of Peace with them in 1660.

In 1663, Thomas Warner, the natural son of the Governor of St. Christopher, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht in 1713 the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia, assumed an attitude of open hostility. In 1718 the Regent d'Orleans made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island, and it was declared neutral.

In 1744, the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. 1756, on the renewal of hostilities the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year by the Treaty of Paris it was assigned to France.

St. Lucia continued in the peaceable possession of the French till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest. In the early part of 1782, Rodney took up his station in Gros-ilet Bay in St. Lucia, with a fleet of 36 sail of the line, and it was from thence that he pursued Count de Grasse, when he gained the memorable battle of the 12th April in that year. This event was followed by the Peace of Versailles, and St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British arms, on the 4th April, 1794.

In 1796, the British Government, seeing the necessity of adopting measures for the protection of their West Indian possessions, despatched to their relief a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On the 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary conflict, which lasted till the 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms, and surrendered as prisoners of war.

Sir John Moore, the future hero of Corunna, who greatly distinguished himself in this campaign,
was appointed Governor of the island, which post he held till the beginning of 1797.

The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities, it surrendered on capitulation to General Grinfield on the 22nd June, 1803, since which period it has continued without interruption under British rule.

The introduction of Coolie labourers commenced in 1859, and in that and the following year four ships with immigrants landed their cargoes at Port Castries.

St. Lucia has undergone many changes in a legal and constitutional point of view. Under the French, whether as the property of the Crown or of the West India Company, whether as a dependency of Martinique or a separate government, its affairs were administered according to the laws and ordinances of the French Monarchy. On the restoration of order in 1800, the Courts of Law were re-organized on the system which prevailed before the Revolution, namely, an inferior Court called the "Sénéchaussée," and a higher Court called the "Conseil Supérieur" or Court of Appeal. The latter Court was composed of a President and twelve Councillors; the Governor often presided therein, and it was invested with certain Executive and Administrative functions.

The English elements engrafted on this system were—1st the establishment in 1816 of a Privy Council, on whose members the title of "Honourable" was conferred in 1818; 2. the introduction in 1827 of English Commercial Law; 3. the promulgation in 1831 of a new Charter of Justice, abolishing the old Judicial system, and establishing a Supreme Court composed of a Chief Justice and two Puisne Judges; 4. the institution in 1832 of Executive and Legislative Councils; 5. the adoption in 1833 of English Procedure and Rules of Evidence in Criminal cases; 6. the substitution in 1834 of the office of Lieutenant-Governor for that of Governor, and the creation of the office of Justice of the Peace as in England; 7. the incorporation of the island in 1838 with the General Government of the Windward Islands; 8. the institution in 1840 of the office of Coroner; 9. the abolition in 1841 of the Colonial Currency; 10. the establishment in 1842 of the English language in all law proceedings; 11. the introduction in 1848 of Trial by Jury in Criminal cases; 12. the establishment in 1851 of Municipal Institutions; 13. the abolition in 1856 of the office of Lieutenant Governor, and the assignment to the Colonial Secretary of the duties of Administrator; 14. the re-organization in 1857 of the Executive Council with the addition of three unofficial members; and lastly the inauguration in 1859 of the Court of Appeal for the Windward Islands. At present the Executive Council is composed of the Attorney-General, Treasurer, and Auditor-General for the time being, the Administrator, and two unofficial members; and the Legislative Council of five official and seven unofficial members, with the Administrator as president.

The Municipal Council in the town of Castries is regulated by the following Ordinances:—2nd May 1850, 23rd December 1850, August 1851, and No. 5 of the 15th July 1856. It consists of 9 Councillors, including the Mayor. The number of Registered Electors is 165, of whom 39 voted at the last annual election of Councillors to replace those who go out in rotation. The qualification of Burgess is 10l. rental, or chattel property of the clear annual value of 10l. sterling. The qualification of Town Councillor is to be enrolled as a

Burgess, and to be possessed of real or personal property, or both, to the clear value of 300l. sterling.

Perhaps the most important change effected in the Laws and Institutions of the Colony, was the enactment, in 1833, of the "Saisie Réelle" Ordinance, authorizing the levy and sale of immoveable property. This law has served all the purposes of an "Encumbered Estates Act."
