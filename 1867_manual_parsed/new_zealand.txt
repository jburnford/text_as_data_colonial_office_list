NEW ZEALAND.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three islands, called New Ulster, New Munster, and New Leinster. These islands lie between 34° and 48° S. lat., and 166° and 179° E. long.: portions of them were explored by Tasman, under the direction of the Dutch East India Company, in 1642; they were afterwards visited at various times in the 18th century, and in 1777 by Captain Cook. The first settlement of Europeans was in 1814, but no colonization took place till 1839.

By Letters Patent, in 1840, New Zealand was erected into a separate Colony, distinct from New South Wales.

The white population of New Zealand was in 1862, 125,812, scattered in small communities over the islands, composed chiefly of emigrants from Great Britain. The wide intervals between these settlements are occupied by natives (Maories), who are estimated at 56,000. The bulk of the natives, i.e. about 50,000, inhabit the Northern island, which contains 31,000,000 acres. The Southern island contains 46,000,000 acres.

The present form of Government for New Zealand was established by Statute 15 and 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act the Colony was divided into six provinces, since increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Otago, Hawkes Bay, Marlborough, Nelson, Canterbury, and Southland—each governed by a Superintendent and a Provincial Council, consisting of not less than 9 members. These Members of Council are chosen by the votes of the inhabitants of the different provinces, and the qualification for Members and Electors is possession in the district for which the vote is given of a freehold estate of the value of
NEW ZEALAND.

50l.; or a leasehold estate of the annual value of 10l., held upon a lease which at the time of registration has not less than 3 years to run; or being a householder within the district of the clear annual value of 10l., or within the limits of a town of the clear annual value of 5l. Aliens are disqualified. Every Council continues for 4 years from the day of the return of the writs, unless dissolved by the Governor.

The Superintendent and Council of each province, with certain restrictions specified in the Act, have the power of making such Laws as may be required for peace and order. Such Laws are, however, to be sent to the Governor for his assent, and may be disallowed within three months after their receipt. No Laws have any force until assented to by the Governor.

A General Assembly, consisting of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and a House of Representatives, is also established by Act 15 and 16 Vict., cap. 72. Legislative Councillors may hold their seats for life. Members for the House of Representatives are elected by Electors possessing the same qualifications as those who can vote for Provincial Councillors. An Elector is also qualified to be a Member. The House of Representatives is to consist of 53 members—see 24 Vict., cap. 12—elected by 43 electoral districts. In 1864, the number of Electors was 19,522, out of an adult population of 62,197.

The control of Native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of Native Government, were in 1863-4 transferred from the Imperial to the Colonial Government.
