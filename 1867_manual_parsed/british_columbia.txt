BRITISH COLUMBIA.*

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America. It comprises the territory lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, and extends from the frontier line of the United States on the south to the Simpson and Finlay rivers, which form its northern boundary. The average breadth of the territory is about 250 miles, the length of its coast line about 450 miles, and its area (including Queen Charlotte Island) is roughly calculated at 200,000 square miles.

Until the year 1858 British Columbia formed part of the territory over which the Hudson's Bay Company possessed by licence from the Crown the exclusive right of trading. But in that year large discoveries of gold were made in the rivers of the country, which attracted a vast immigration of gold-diggers from California, and rendered it necessary for Her Majesty's Government to take measures to maintain order, and protect life and property. The Hudson's Bay Company's trading licence was therefore revoked, and the country erected into a Colony by an Act of the Imperial Parliament (21 & 22 Vict. cap. 99).

The Colony had, when first created, no form of Representative Government; but laws were made by the Governor in the shape of proclamations, which were submitted to the Queen, and laid before both Houses of Parliament: by a recent Order in Council, however, a Legislative Council has been established, to consist of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Surveyor-General, and the Collector of Customs, of five Magistrates from different parts of the country, and of five unofficial members, who are selected by the votes of the inhabitants of the respective districts, all but Chinese and Indians being allowed to vote.

The population of the country is chiefly migratory, consisting of mining adventurers from California, and other parts of the world, and including considerable numbers of Chinese. The settled white population may be stated at between 5,000 and 10,000.

The climate is temperate, and presents a remarkable contrast to that of the rest of the continent of North America, in the same latitude, on the other side of the Rocky Mountains. Besides gold, the country produces magnificent timber and good coal. Promising indications of silver have been discovered in several localities. Some of the ore having been assayed has yielded at the rate of 250l. to the ton. These leads are now being thoroughly tested. Seams of excellent anthracite coal have lately been discovered in Queen Charlotte's Island, and works are now in progress there.

The revenue is raised principally by means of customs duties: there is no direct taxation except upon traders and miners, a licence to enable the latter to mine and take out gold in any part of British Columbia, only costing one pound sterling annually.

Agricultural operations have been greatly extended during the last three years, and have proved the character of the land throughout the colony to be admirably adapted for the culture of cereals. Land once thought valueless is now under heavy crops. The wheat, barley, oats, and other farm produce of the Colony, may compare favourably with that raised even in California. Grist mills are gradually being erected. Tracts of good grazing land exist throughout the Colony, but the districts of Shemilkainen, Okanagan, and Nicola Lake, offer excellent pasture land. The spars manufactured from the Doryar pine bear the highest commercial value, for size, strength, and durability. The lumber trade is gradually on the increase. There is an unlimited supply of excellent material throughout the Colony.

The fur trade of this part of the world is also a noticeable feature. The skins exported chiefly consist of mink, marten, sable, silver fox, bear.

* An Act has passed the Imperial Parliament for the incorporation of Vancouver's Island with British Columbia; the Government of the Colony is therefore in a transition state, and no notice of Vancouver's Island will be found under V, but at page 120 a history of the Island is given, the Civil Establishment being omitted.
beaver, sea and land otter, fur seal, deer, elk, raccoon, siffleur, and others of minor importance. This trade was originally altogether in the hands of the Hudson Bay Company, but has now become general, and is considered remunerative.

Large quantities of excellent cranberries yearly find a ready sale in California.

The Fraser River abounds in salmon, sturgeon, and a small fish called the "oulakon," but this branch of industry has not been extensively carried on hitherto. The sea fisheries consist of herring, cod, smelt, halibut, and dog fish, all in great abundance.

There is a continuous line of telegraph from New Westminster to England, and Collins' Russian Line passes through the Colony, from south to north, thus placing the remote district of Cariboo in direct communication with America and Europe.

The acquisition of land under pre-emptive right is simple and inexpensive: any British subject can take up a claim of 160 acres of land, and settle upon the same with the certainty of not being called upon to pay for the land until it is included in the survey of the Colony, and then at a rate not exceeding 4s. 2d. an acre. Any quantity of land immediately adjacent to a pre-emptive claim can be purchased by the pre-emptor of such claim upon payment down of half the purchase-money; the remainder when the land is surveyed—in no case exceeding 4s. 2d. per acre in the whole. Town lots and suburban lands are put up for sale at public auction.
