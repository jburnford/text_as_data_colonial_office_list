ANGUILLA.

The island of Anguilla is a part of the Lieut.-Government of St. Kitt's, and sends one member to the Assembly. For local purposes it is governed by a stipendiary magistrate, paid from the Imperial Treasury. This officer is assisted by a Vestry, of which he is chairman. The Vestry, which is constituted by an Act, is composed of the stipendiary magistrates, the rector, and eleven elected members.

The revenue of Anguilla in 1861 was £414l., and the expenditure £240l. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court, the Small Debt Court. There are also supposed to be Courts of Queen's Bench and Common Pleas and Chancery in the island, and the Chief Justice of St. Kitt's visits it once a year to hear civil and criminal cases.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.E. of St. Kitt's, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a-half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is about 2,500, of whom 100 are white, and the rest coloured and black. Cotton is exciting attention, and about sixty acres of it are under cultivation. The other productions are sugar, phosphate of lime, and salt. The revenue is chiefly derived from a duty of five cents per barrel on salt.

President, G. Alsbury, 500l.
