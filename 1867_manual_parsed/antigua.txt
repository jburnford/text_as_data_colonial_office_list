ANTIGUA.

An island situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference. Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1632. In 1663, Charles II. made a formal grant of this island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. The Governor-in-Chief of the Leeward Islands resides at St. John's, the chief town in Antigua. There are no rivers, and few springs in this island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. Area of the Island 108 square miles. £7456 is annually spent in the support of Poor Houses, Hospitals, Board of Health, and for Medical Relief, Vaccination, &c. There are 14 places of worship belonging to the Church of England, 13 Moravian, 10 Wesleyan.

The Revenue of the Colony is derived from the following sources, viz., under an Act passed in 1799, a tax of ½d. per acre of land, and a tax of 1½d. per 100 gallons of molasses—1½d. per 100 gallons on rum manufactured in the Island—a duty on imports—a duty on the tonnage of vessels entering into and clearing from the Island—a tax on carriages for hire—a duty on licenses to carry fire-arms—a duty on licences to sell liquors—fees of office—a duty on boat, porters, and jobbers' licenses—market tolls—fines, penalties, and forfeitures. In addition to the above sources of Revenue there are special funds raised for the support of the Established Church, for the introduction of Immigrants, and for the maintenance of the Militia Cavalry Corps. For the support of the Church the funds are raised principally from taxes on land in the several parishes, ranging in amount from 9d. to 6s. an acre. For the Militia, an export duty of 3s. 4d. on each hogshead of sugar. And as an Immigration tax, a duty of 4s. 6d. a gallon on all rum consumed in the Island, and a tax of 4s. 6d. on each hogshead of sugar exported.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; a Legislative Council, also appointed by the Crown; and a House of Assembly, consisting of 27 members elected by the various parishes.*

The Qualifications for Members and Voters are fixed by an Act of 1832, and are as follows:—

For Members.—An annual income of 66l. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of 200l. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of 26l. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of 11l., or one acre of land and building value 222l., or tenant paying not less than 88l. per annum.

The Island is divided into fourteen electoral districts. Of the 522 voters registered for the whole Island, 319 are registered for the City of St. John. The towns of English Harbour, Falmouth, and Parham, return 2 members, and the remaining 203 voters are registered for eleven county districts, returning 21 members.

In addition to the Executive Council and the Legislative Council and Assembly, the Governor, by an Act of the Local Legislature passed in 1859, is assisted by an Administrative Committee selected by himself, one member from the Legislative Council and two from the Assembly; they hold office during pleasure. The duties of the Committee are to assist the Governor in preparing the annual estimates, in collecting and disbursing public moneys, and in the general administration of the Finances of the Colony; they form a Board of Audit of Public Accounts, and are the official organs of communication between the Governor and the Legislative Chambers. The powers of the Committee exist in and out of Session, and also during a dissolution of the House of Assembly.
