WEST AFRICAN SETTLEMENTS.

SIERRA LEONE, GAMBIA, GOLD COAST, AND LAGOS.

Sierra Leone, in respect of the number of its European residents, is the most considerable of the British Possessions on the West Coast of Africa. The Colony consists of a peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, which is bounded on the north by a river of the same name. The Cape lies in 8° 30' N. lat., 13° 18' W. long.; this Colony is 18 miles in length by 12 in breadth, with an area of 300 square miles. Sierra Leone was ceded to Great Britain in 1787 by the native chiefs. Four years afterwards a charter was granted to a Company under the name of "The Sierra Leone Company." In 1800 a grant was made to the Company by Letters Patent of the peninsula, and a Court of Directors of the Company was empowered to appoint a Governor and Council, the former having power to enact laws: this state of things lasted 7 years, when the Colony was transferred back to the Crown.*

In 1862 a large tract of country called Sherboro was handed over by treaty to the Colony. In this district British rule prevails, and Major Blackall reports that domestic slavery has been abolished,

and that the expenditure thrown on the colony by the transfer has been met by a great increase in customs dues levied on English goods, representing an increase of trade of not less than 75,000l.

The Government of Sierra Leone consisted, until May, 1863, of a Governor and a Legislative Council, comprising the Bishop of Sierra Leone, the Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary, the Collector of Customs, and one or two others appointed by the Crown.

By a new Charter issued at that date (May 27, 1863), an Executive Council was created, composed of four members nominated by the Crown, and the Legislative Council was made to consist of the members of the Executive Council, and "such other Person or Persons as We, by any Instruction or Warrant under Our Sign-Manual and Signet, may from time to time hereafter nominate and appoint to be members of the said Legislative Council."

But in 1865, it was decided that the Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa should be re-established in Sierra Leone, Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos were accordingly placed under its jurisdiction.

The commission and instructions under which this change was effected were dated in February, 1866. They revoked and determined the former commission issued in respect of Sierra Leone, the Gambia, the Gold Coast, and Lagos, and constituted on the West Coast of Africa one Government-in-Chief, to be called the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and to comprise the four colonies aforesaid. Within each of the four said settlements a Legislative Council was established, to consist of the Governor and of other persons, being not less than two in number, within each settlement as should be named by instruction or warrant under the sign manual. Power was vested in these councils to establish, subject to the veto of the Governor-General, such ordinances as might be necessary for the good government of the settlements.

Within the settlement of Sierra Leone, an Executive Council was established for the purpose of advising and assisting the Governor-General.

It was provided that the Governor should reside in Sierra Leone, except when the interest of the service might render his presence desirable in any other of the said settlements.

Provision is also made in the commission, that in case of the death or absence of the Governor, the Government shall be administered by the Lieutenant-Governor, or if there should be no such person, by the Senior Military Officer in command of the troops. In Lagos, Gambia, and the Gold Coast, similar powers are, in the absence of the Administrators, vested in the Collectors of Customs there.

British coins are in circulation at their value in Sierra Leone; there are also in circulation the golden doubloon and its subdivisions, and the twenty-franc piece, the golden American eagle and its subdivisions, the Spanish and Mexican silver dollar, and the five-franc piece. The average rate of exchange is about 1 per cent. on Treasury Bills.

The taxation of the Colony consists of an ad valorem duty of 4 per cent. on all imports except wines, spirits, tobacco, &c. on which specific rates are charged. There are also licence duties, taxes on houses and land, and a tax for the repair of roads.
