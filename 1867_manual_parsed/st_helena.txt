ST. HELENA.

St. Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, 15° 15' S. lat., and 5° 46' W. long. St. Helena is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad; its area 47 square miles.

The capital is James Town, which is on the N.W. of the island. The climate is mild, and little variable; thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. Estimated acreage, 30,300.

St. Helena was discovered by the Portuguese commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1501. The Portuguese managed to keep secret the situation of this island from other European nations till 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden of the English Navy, in 1673 took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 1833, when it was handed over to the British Government. St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant; it is frequented by ships on their homeward voyage from the East Indies for fresh provisions and water, which constitutes the trade of the island.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by a Council, of which the Chief Justice and Officer Commanding the Troops are members.
