NOVA SCOTIA.*

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° and 46° N. lat., and 61° and 67° W. long.; it is connected with New Brunswick by a low sandy isthmus; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation however, containing an area of 15,600 square miles, or 9,884,000 acres, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea; deducting this one-fifth part and the land unsuited for agricultural purposes, there is left rather more than 5,000,000 acres of land fit for tillage. The forest of Nova Scotia abounds in good timber—the ash, the beech, the birch, the maple, the oak, the pine, and the spruce, are the most common trees.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonized by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I., in 1627. In 1632 it

was again restored to France, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears that name is the capital of the colony.

The harbour of Halifax has an area of about 10 square miles, is open at all seasons, and its navigation is scarcely ever interrupted by ice. This harbour is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for, it is said, 1,000 ships. The British Government have at Halifax an extensive dockyard, and its principal naval station in North America.

The climate is healthy; but the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is frequently visited by dense fogs, and the variations of temperature within 24 hours are remarkably great, sometimes exceeding 60°. The greatest heat observed at Halifax by Captain Moorsom was 93° Fahr., and the extreme cold 10°.

Coal and Iron Ore are plentiful in Nova Scotia. Gold also has recently been discovered, and is yielding fair returns; but the greater portion of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and the growth of fruit, though the superior fisheries, together with the ship-building and timber trade, give occupation to many.

The Government of Nova Scotia is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council of nine members. The Legislature is composed of a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly. The members of the Legislative Council are appointed by the Crown. The Legislative Assembly consists of fifty-three representatives chosen by the people.

Electors must be Male British subjects of the age of twenty-one years, and must be possessed of real estate of the value of 150 dols., or of personal estate, or real and personal estate together, of the value of 300 dols., and must not have received aid as paupers within twelve months next preceding the election.

Representatives must be Male British subjects of the age of twenty-one years, qualified to be electors, or possessing freehold estate of the yearly value of 8 dols.
