QUEENSLAND.

This Colony comprises the whole north-eastern portion of the Australian continent. Its southern boundary commences at Point Danger, on the seaboard of the Pacific, in about 28° 8' S. lat.; thence follows the range dividing the waters of the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence Rivers from those of the Logan and Brisbane Rivers; thence it proceeds in a westerly direction until the line meets the great dividing range between the waters falling to the east coast and those of the river Murray; thence it follows a devious line of water-sheds and rivers to the point where the river McIntyre cuts the 29° of S. lat.; whence it follows that parallel westerly to the 141st meridian of east longitude, which forms the eastern boundary of the Colony of South Australia; thence it follows the 141st meridian of longitude till it is inter-
sected by the 26th parallel of S. lat. (which forms the northern boundary of the last-mentioned Colony), along which it proceeds so far as to the 138th meridian of longitude, which it follows northwards to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Queensland also comprises, in the terms of Her Majesty's Letters Patent, "all and every the adjacent islands, their members and appurtenances, in the Pacific Ocean and in the Gulf of Carpentaria."

It appears from the Statistical Register of Queensland for 1861 (page 2) that "the Surveyor-General has made a careful calculation of the present area of the Colony; and the result is, in round numbers, as follows:

**Area of Queensland.**

| Square Miles |
|--------------|
| East of longitude 141° | 560,000 |
| Between 141° and 138° | 118,600 |
| **Total** | **678,600** |

**Occupied Country.**

| Square Miles |
|--------------|
| Approximate area of country occupied by pastoral stations | 195,000 |

**Seaboard of Queensland.**

| Miles |
|-------|
| Point Danger to Cape York | 1,550 |
| Cape York to longitude 141° | 475 |
| Longitude 141° to 138° | 225 |
| **Total** | **2,250** |

"It will be seen from the above figures that Queensland is the most extensive of the British Colonies; it possesses an area nearly double the area of Canada; and if compared with European States, is one-half larger than England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France, and Spain, all added together; it is in fact nearly equal in area to one-fifth of the area of the whole of Europe and its dependencies. Pastoral occupation has already spread over a surface twice as large as that of the British Isles; and it is annually advancing onward at a rate which will soon place our stockholders on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria."

It may here be added that, at the end of 1865, the approximate area of country occupied by pastoral stations had increased to above 500,000 square miles (i.e. to more than four times the area of the United Kingdom); and that the stockholders had reached the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria and York Peninsula.

The vast territory thus defined formed a part of New South Wales until it was erected into a separate Colony, under the name of Queensland, by an order of Her Majesty in Council, which took effect on December 10, 1859, upon the arrival of the first Governor, Sir G. F. Bowen. Its eastern sea-board was discovered by Captain Cook, who anchored in Moreton Bay in May, 1770. Thirty years afterwards many points of the coast were visited by Captain Flinders; but the first attempt to explore and settle any portion of the interior was made in 1824 by Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General of New South Wales, who in that year entered the river Brisbane, and selected the site of the future city of that name (now the capital of the new Colony) on a spot about 20 miles from its mouth in Moreton Bay. The subsequent settlement of the country has followed the discoveries of a series of explorers, chief among whom have been Cunningham, Mitchell, Kennedy, Leichhardt, Burnett, Gregory, Dalrymple, Burke, McKinlay, Walker, Landsborough, and Jardine.

In a territory extending over above seventeen degrees of latitude there are necessarily great variations of temperature. The heat is, of course, greater on the sea-board than on the elevated table-land of the interior. But the climate is described as everywhere favourable to the European constitution; and it is stated that persons who have passed the greater part of their lives in the more inhospitable atmosphere of Great Britain, often find their health and vigour surprisingly renewed in this genial country. The mean annual temperature at Brisbane (the seat of Government) is 68° 7', almost exactly the same as at Funchal, in Madeira.

Most of the productions of both temperate and tropical countries can be cultivated with success in Queensland. The climate is peculiarly favourable to pastoral occupations, and to the growth of wool. Experience has shown that extensive districts are also admirably adapted for the production of cotton, sugar, and tobacco. Many writers regard this Colony as destined to become the future cotton-field of Great Britain. Gold, copper, coal, &c., have been already discovered in several districts.

The form of Government established in Queensland resembles that of the other principal Australian Colonies—that is, it is composed of a Governor and two Houses of Parliament.

The Legislative Council is nominated by the Governor. It consists at present of 20 members, nominated for life. The House of Assembly is elective. There are 22 electorates, and 32 members, elected for five years. Vote by ballot is regulated by the Electoral Act, 22 Vict. No. 20. The qualifications for electors were provided for in the N. S. W. Constitution Act, No. 41, 17 Vict., but they have since been specified in the Local Act, 29 Vict., No. 12, "To amend and consolidate the laws relating to the registration of persons qualified to vote in the election of members to serve in the Legislative Assembly." The qualifications are as follow:—Every man of the age of 21, being a natural born or naturalized subject of Her Majesty, and having a freehold estate in possession, situate in the district for which his vote is to be given, of the clear value of 10l., or being a householder, occupying house, warehouse, or shop, of the clear annual value of 10l., or having a leasehold estate of the value of 10l., which, at the time of registration, has not less than three years to run, or having a salary of 10l. a year, or being the occupant of a lodging, paying for board and lodging 40l. a year, or for lodging only at the rate of 10l. a year.

The Aborigines are estimated at 15,000.
