NEWFOUNDLAND.

This island is situated between 46° 30' and 51° 33' N. lat., and 52° 15' and 53° 60' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles. It was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries.

Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634, a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and 20 years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary Grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was ceded to Great Britain, subject to certain rights reserved to France, which are still in question between the two nations.

Newfoundland was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was fully established, however, in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council of 7 members, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 30 members, elected by householders, who have occupied a dwelling-house as owner or tenant for 2 years immediately preceding the day of election. There are 17,451 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 15 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 5 return three members; 5 return two members, and 5 return one. There is a property qualification for the elected; viz. property exceeding 500l. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l. The ordinary duration of the Session is about
three months, and it generally meets at the end of January.

The principal exports of the Colony are codfish, cod and seal oils, and seal skins. Total tonnage of vessels entered and cleared in 1863, 270,403.
