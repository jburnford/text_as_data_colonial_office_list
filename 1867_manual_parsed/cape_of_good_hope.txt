CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of that name is washed by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north by the Gariep or Orangeriver, on the north-east by the territory of the Basutos, on the east by Kaffirland, and including what was formerly the Colony of British Kaffaria. The Cape Colony contains an area of about 188,286 square miles.

In 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, discovered the Cape in the reign of John II. of Portugal. Vasco de Gama doubled it 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1652 the Colony was colonized by the Dutch East India Company, under Van Riebeek. The Cape remained in possession of the Dutch till the year 1795 when the British Government took possession, but ceded it at the Peace of Amiens, 1802, to its former possessors, and in 1806, it was again taken by the English, to whom it was confirmed at the General Peace 1815: it has since continued a British Colony.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to people of European birth: the temperature at Cape Town, by tables compiled from careful observations during twenty years made by Sir Thomas Maclear, the Astronomer-Royal at the Cape observatory, is shown to be less variable than in most countries: the average temperature in winter was but 14° 86° below that of summer: the mean temperature was 61° 88°, the highest was 96° 8°, the lowest 37° 7°. The summer may be said to begin in November and last till April, when winter commences.

The Cape may be said to possess a healthy climate without violent changes from heat to cold; and experience has proved that the early symptoms of consumption have been entirely eradicated by residence there.

The settlers at the Cape are chiefly employed in the production of wool, wine, and in the breeding of horses, cattle, and sheep, and in the growth of wheat, barley, oats, and maize. The wheat of this Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. No doubt the railroad now completed between Cape Town and Wellington will greatly stimulate all industrial pursuits by affording facilities of transport.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few
Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, was created.

By Letters Patent dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later the present form of Government was brought into force. The Governor is now assisted by an Executive Council, composed of certain office-holders appointed by the Crown. There is a Legislative Council of 21 elected members, presided over, *ex officio*, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 62 elected members, increased in consequence of the incorporation of British Kaffraria, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony. The Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer-General, and the Auditor-General, who are members of the Executive Council, can take part in the debates of the Legislative Council and House of Assembly: they cannot vote in either house; but in the House of Assembly they are allowed to introduce measures. There is an election at the end of every five years for the Council, when eight and seven members are elected alternately. The qualification for members is possession of immovable property of £2,000, or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a member of Assembly. Members of both houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified by possession of property, or receipt of salary or wages, of not less than £50 per annum, or not less than £25 with board and lodging. The Judicial establishment comprises the Supreme Court of three Judges, who hold Sessions in Cape Town and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts. An Eastern Province High Court of Judicature has also been established, entitled "The Eastern Districts Court," the two Judges of which hold Sessions in Grahamstown and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts.

Cape Town is the capital of the Colony and the seat of Government: it is built between Table Bay and Table Mountain, at the foot of the latter: this mountain rises 3,582 feet above the sea. The town is well laid out, and contains numerous public buildings and several good squares.

| 1864 | £587,713† | £633,936    |
| 1865 | £536,798 | £668,189‡   |

The population, white and coloured, according to the last returns made in 1865, was as follows:

- European: 181,582
- Hottentot: 81,598
- Kafr: 100,536
- Other: 132,655
- Total: 496,381

* This is calculated for financial year ending 30th June.
† The Actual Revenue of 1864 is £19,000, in excess of that of 1863.
‡ The apparent decrease is owing to the fact that in 1863, £268,000 of the receipts were raised as a loan.
§ These figures represent Actual Revenue and Expenditure, irrespective of Loans.

British Kaffraria, included in Cape Colony.

British Kaffraria was first occupied by Europeans in 1835 under Sir B. D'Urban, but was subsequently abandoned in 1837.

In 1846 it was again occupied as a military station; but in 1848 the necessity for recognizing it as a British Colony became apparent, and a staff of officials was organized to aid, under Martial Law, in the maintenance of peace and the control of its public affairs. It was considered a dependency of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, from the revenues of which its deficit was made good.

In 1855 Sir George Grey appointed magistrates to the native tribes, subsidized the chiefs and principal counsellors, employed a number of their followers as rural police and village headmen, and established a Criminal Court for the trial of grave offences; its finances were separated from those of the neighbouring Colony, and liberal grants made by the Imperial Government to promote the civilization of its native inhabitants.

In 1860 Letters Patent, constituting British Kaffraria a separate Colony, were promulgated; its first Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, a Supreme Court created, and a Municipal Corporation granted to King William's Town. The Constitution thus given has recently been altered.

British Kaffraria, by Acts of the Colonial Legislature, passed at the end of 1865, has been incorporated with the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope. By another Act, passed at the same time, ad-
ditional members were added to the House of Assembly, four of them sitting for that portion of the Colony which was until then known as the Colony of British Kaffraria. Two Electoral Divisions have been erected with a view of representing this territory in the Cape Parliament. For elections to the Legislative Council, British Kaffraria forms part of the Eastern Districts.

The principal seaport at the mouth of the Buffalo is called East London; the anchorage is very good. Harbour works have been undertaken for its improvement, but small craft, of shallow draught, are able to enter the river, and discharge or load at the wharf. A lighthouse has been erected at the entrance of the river.

Crown lands are sold in freehold at £2 per acre.

Its progress has been greatly promoted by the introduction of a number of English and Dutch farmers from the neighbouring colony, who hold their grants of land under military servitude, and the payment of an annual ground-rent, while a number of German immigrants, whose condition is prosperous, have become a useful and thrifty peasantry.

Its exports are wool, hides, timber, and grain.
