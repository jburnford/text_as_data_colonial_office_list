**LAGOS.**

A Commission, dated the 13th March, 1862, was passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom declaring that the Port and Island of Lagos, together with all the territories which do now or may hereafter belong to the Crown of Great Britain, on the coast of Africa, between the 1st and 10th parallels of east longitude, and the south of the 10th parallel of north latitude, shall constitute a separate government, under the title of the Settlements of Lagos.

The permanent occupation of this territory was deemed necessary for the more complete suppression of the slave-trade in the Bight of Benin, for the protection and development of the important trade of which the town of Lagos was the seat, and for the benefit of the surrounding tribes of Africans.

On the 6th of August, 1861, the treaty ceding the Island of Lagos to Her Majesty was signed by Docemo, and he was guaranteed a pension of 1,000l. a year. At the present time Lagos and the towns of Badagry, Palma, and Leckie, and the seaboard between them and the Lagoon are recognized as British territory.

The exports are palm oil, ivory, and cotton.

The Government was administered by a Governor, assisted by an executive Council of three Members, viz., the Chief Magistrate, the Colonial Secretary, and the Senior Military Officer. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, the Chief Magistrate, the Colonial Secretary, the Senior Military Officer and two unofficial Members.

In consequence of the deliberations of a Committee of the House of Commons which sat on the affairs of the west coast of Africa, the Central Government of the settlements on that coast, including the colony of Lagos, was established at Sierra Leone. By instructions addressed to the Governor-General on 20th February, 1866, the Government of the settlement was vested in an Administrator, aided by a Legislative Council, consisting of the Collector of Customs and the Police Magistrates, together with such other persons who, from time to time, may be named by instructions or by warrant under the sign manual.

All laws are subject to the approval of the Governor-General who resides at Sierra Leone, and visits each settlement once a year.
