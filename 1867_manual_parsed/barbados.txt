BARBADOS

Is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most windward of the Caribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 English miles long by 14 in breadth, and is said to contain a superficial area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known, but the first indication of its existence in the charts was in 1600. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the Isle Los Barbudos, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found, and then abandoned it. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I., fitted out two large ships, one of which only arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some 30 persons, landed on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I. of all the Caribbee Islands, which was opposed by the former patentee, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour, and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who soon reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The leeward and windward men opposed each other, but the latter ultimately triumphed. As in all new colonies, the inhabitants met with no inconsiderable difficulties. Local feuds were added to domestic privations, but the civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterward governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the power of the Commonwealth, he was banished. In 1662 after the restoration of Charles II., Lord Willoughby renewed his claim on Barbados, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sove-
reignty of Barbados annexed to the British crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners: it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, the principal of 11 parishes into which the island was divided at a very early date. This town contains, according to the last census, 18,957 inhabitants. Recently a most important project for supplying the town with water was undertaken and completed by a joint-stock company incorporated by an act of the legislature.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, which is much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or carenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. The works in connection with this harbour were formerly under the supervision of a legislative committee; but, by an enactment in 1856, its duties were transferred to the governor in council.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as in the parish of St. Philip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation. A lighthouse was erected in 1852 on the south point of the island, partly at the expense of the British government. A harbour-light was also placed on Needham's Point in 1855.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. It is stated that, in 1683, there were 358 sugar-workers in operation. At the present time they number over 500.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 shows a total of 132,727 inhabitants, 16,594 of which are white, and the remainder coloured and black. Where so great a population exists, great industry is essential to enable the people to live. Thus, labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden, and the roads throughout are excellent.

From an early date, each of the 11 parishes of the island was presided over by a clergyman of the Church of England; but it was not till 1824 that the Bishopric of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, with British Guiana, was erected. In 1842, upon the resignation of Dr. Coleridge (the first bishop), British Guiana and the Leeward Islands were separated from the Windward, and constituted distinct sees. There are at present in the island, besides the bishop and archdeacon, 43 clergymen of the Church of England.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30l. per annum from the College funds, and three of similar value paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or residents. There is also a school which stands in close relation to the College, and is called the Codrington Collegiate Grammar School.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. It consists of an Inspector-general, 1 Superintending Sergeant, 10 Sergeants, 20 Corporals and 188 Privates.

An inland Post Office was first set on foot in 1852; it has since been amalgamated with the General Post Office, from whence are delivered all letters, including those from beyond the seas. Through this office a letter may be sent to any part of the island, reaching its destination the same day, for 1d. the 4oz.

A lunatic asylum and a lazaretto are also institutions kept up at the public expense: and there is a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the Colony contributes 2,300l. per annum.

The island forms the head-quarters of Her Majesty's forces in the Windward and Leeward command, under a major-general who resides in Barbados. The troops stationed in the island are garrisoned at St. Ann's, which is situated at the southern extremity of the city.

Volunteer rifle, artillery, and yeomanry-cavalry corps have been recently organized.

The Local Government of Barbados consists of a Governor (who is also Governor-in-Chief of St. Vincent, Grenada, Tobago, and St. Lucia), a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly. There is also an Executive Council, composed of the same members as are of the Legislative. The members are appointed by mandamus of the Sovereign, and hold their office during the Royal pleasure. The number is not limited, but there must never be less than seven resident in the island. The Lord Bishop is a member ex-officio. In their legislative capacity the Council make laws concurrently with the House of Assembly and the Governor. They sit with the Governor in Executive Council, where he passes all warrants for the payment of money, issues all writs for the elections of members of Assembly, and performs other duties imposed by specific Acts. In former years almost every judicial function in the island was executed either collectively or individually by the Members of Council, who composed the Court of Chancery, the Court of Error, and discharged in rotation the office of Judge of the Criminal Sessions, till the year 1841, when a Chief Justice was appointed. The Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas for the five precincts into which the island used to be divided were selected from the Members of Council; but the improvements which have within these last few years been introduced into the administration of justice have relieved the Board of all their equity, and a great portion of their appellate jurisdiction. Exceptions to parish-rates are heard and determined by the Governor in Council, by whom the assessments must be confirmed before they are levied. The Assembly consists of two Members for Bridgetown and two for each of the 11 parishes, and its duration is limited to twelve months. The qualifications of Members and Electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, passed in 1842, and are as follows for Electors:

Possession of estate for life, or in right of marriage, of not less than the annual value of 20l., or less interest in rents and profits of land of a similar amount.

Lessor or assignee of lands or tenements when the rent shall not be less than 100l., and the term
of lease was in its original creation of not less than five years.

Occupant in any town of any house or premises parochially rated at not less than 50l. per annum. Payment of parochial taxes for two years to the amount of 5l.

At the General Election, May, 1865, the number of registered electors was 1334. A contested election only occurred in one division, that of St. Lucy, when 109 electors voted out of 127.

In addition to their legislative functions, the Members of Assembly are called upon to discharge various executive duties, which devolve on Committees, either named by the legislative bodies to which they belong, or selected by the Governor from the Council and Assembly.

BERMUDAS,

Or Somers' Islands, a cluster of about 300 small islands, situated on the western side of the Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 32° 15' N. and long. 64° 51' W., at a distance of about 580 miles from the nearest land, at Cape Hatteras in North Carolina.

Fifteen or sixteen of these islands are inhabited; the rest are of inconsiderable size, the largest, or Bermuda proper, containing less than 20 square miles of land, and nowhere exceeding 3 miles in breadth.

They extend from N.E. to S.W., in a curved line for about 20 miles, bending inwards at both extremities, so as to enclose spacious and secure harbours.

Besides the main island, on which the town of Hamilton, the present seat of Government, is situated, the principal islands are St. George's, where the ancient town of St. George, the former capital, stands; Ireland Island, where the dock yard is established; Boaz, containing the convict prisons; Somerset, connected with the main island by a bridge; St. David's, Smith's, Cooper's, Non-such, Godet's, Port's, River's, &c.

The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. Besides potatoes and other esculent roots and vegetables, bananas, oranges, peaches, and other fruits, the land produces arrowroot of a fine quality, and an indigenous cedar of great durability, well adapted for ship-building and house-timber.

The sea abounds with fish. A few whales and turtle are occasionally taken.

These islands derive their name from Bermudez, a Spaniard, who sighted them in 1527. The earliest account is given of them by Henry May, who was cast away upon them in 1593, in a French ship, commanded by Monsieur Barbotiere; but they were first colonized by Admiral Sir George Somers, who was shipwrecked here in 1609, on his way to Virginia. On his report, the Virginia Company claimed them, and obtained a charter for them from James I. in 1612. This company sold their right for 2,000l. to an association of 120 persons, who obtained a new charter in 1616, incorporating them as the Bermuda Company, and granting them very extensive powers and privileges.

Representative government was introduced in 1620. In 1621 the Bermuda Company in London,
made a Body of Ordinances for the Government of the Colony. During the civil war, great numbers of emigrants from England were attracted hither by the favourable reports of the climate and soil; but towards the end of the reign of Charles II., grave complaints were made by the inhabitants, of the misgovernment of the plantation by the company; and the Charter of the Bermuda Company was annulled by process of Quo Warranto, at Westminster, in 1684-85. Since then, the Governors have been appointed by the Crown, and laws for the Colony enacted by a local legislature, consisting of the Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The lands belonging to the Company were forfeited to the Crown, on the dissolution of their Charter; and, with the exception of some reserved for public uses, were granted in 1759 to purchasers on small quit-rents, extinguishable on the payment of a fixed sum of money.

During the revolutionary war in North America, the inhabitants suffered great privations from the scarcity of food; but ever since the settlement of the islands by Sir George Somers, in 1609, this Colony has uninterruptedly continued to belong to the English Crown.

In 1784 a printing-press was introduced. Early in the present century, the importance of the Bermudas as a naval station became manifest. Ireland Island was purchased exclusively by the Government, and a Dock Yard established there. By Order in Council, dated June 23, 1824, male convicts were ordered to be kept at hard labour on the public works at the Bermudas; but these islands never were made a penal settlement, nor were the convicts allowed to be discharged there. The establishment was broken up in 1863.

On the abolition of slavery in 1834, the system of temporary apprenticeship of the emancipated slaves, permitted by the Act of Parliament in the slave-holding colonies, was dispensed with by the local legislature of Bermuda, so as to entitle the slaves to their absolute freedom six years sooner than was required by the Act of Parliament. They and their descendants now form rather more than a numerical half of the entire population.

In 1846, a lighthouse, visible at more than 30 miles' distance, was erected on the loftiest land in the Colony. A public library was established in 1839.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, and a Privy Council, consisting at present of 9 members, appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor, who also act as a Legislative Council. There is a House of Assembly of 36 members, consisting of four representatives from each parish. There are 842 electors. The qualification is possession of a freehold of not less than 60l. value. The qualification for a member is possession of a freehold rated at 240l. The last general election was in 1864; and the average duration of the session is 135 days, although during that period they usually only sit 2 or 3 days in a week. The Bermudas, since 1844, have been annexed to the episcopal diocese of Newfoundland. There is an Episcopal parish church in each of the nine parishes. They are divided into five livings, of which the parish of St. George constitutes one, and each of the other livings comprises two adjoining parishes, besides which, there are an Episcopal Church in Hamilton, two Presbyterian Churches, two Wesleyan, and one Roman Catholic chapel, and a number of chapel schools of different denominations.
