ST. CHRISTOPHER’S AND ANGUILLA (AND NEVIS).

The following general description of St. Kitt’s is extracted from a Report on that Island, written by Lieutenant-Governor Sir Benjamin Pine, which was printed and laid before Parliament, March, 1862.

“The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

“The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The breadth of its main body is about five miles; that of the knob or peninsula is about two miles. The breadth of the neck varies from half a mile to a mile. The total area is 68 square miles.

“The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital.

“Immediately beyond these hills on the south-east is the narrowest part of the neck, which at this point is perfectly flat. But as it expands it rises into conical hills, which, covered with grass, prickly mimosas or aloes, traverse the knob or peninsula in almost every direction. In one spot, however, the hills recede from the sea, forming a basin, within which is a salt-pond about two miles in circumference.

“The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

“These tracts of land are covered with sugar plantations, and dotted over in every direction with homesteads, mills, and labourers’ villages.

“The higher slopes of the mountains are clothed with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood.”

The climate in St. Kitt’s, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. From observations made by Mr. Evelyn, the Controller of Revenue of the colony, it appears that the average range of the thermometer was, in August, in 1866, 8 a.m., 83° 1/2°, and in February of the same year, 77° 1/2°, 87° at noon, 86 at 4 p.m.

Until 1866 the Government was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor (subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief at Antigua), aided by an Executive Council composed of ten members appointed by the Crown; a Legislative Council of not less than eight members, likewise appointed by the Crown; and a House of Assembly of twenty-five members, elected by the various parishes.

But in April of that year Governor Sir Benjamin Pine introduced measures which he had long advocated, and which had for their effect the amendment and simplification of the Constitution of the Island.

Three Acts, Nos. 551, 552, 553, of 1866, were accordingly proposed and passed. The first abolished the two existing Houses of Legislature, and substituted for them a single Chamber, composed of three Officers of the Crown, who sit ex-officio; of seven Nominees of the Crown; and of ten Members, to be elected by the nine existing electoral Divisions.

The Lieutenant-Governor, under this ordinance, is vested with the appointment of a paid President, who exercises two votes.

This Assembly is to last for five years, at the end of which time all the members, except the ex-officio ones, vacate their seats, but are eligible to be re-nominated and re-elected.

The elected members hold no office of emolument under the Crown. There is no restriction of the kind as to nominee members.

The second Act abolishes the Administrative Committee, and substitutes for it three paid Officers as Chief Advisers of the Government, viz.—The Attorney-General, the Secretary to Government, and the Auditor; for this purpose it creates the two last-named Officers.

The third Act abolished the office of Coroner,
and made other provisions for the discharge of the duties thereof.

Nevis is to be included within the Lieutenant-Government of St. Kitts.
