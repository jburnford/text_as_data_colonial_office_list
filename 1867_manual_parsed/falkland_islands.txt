FALKLAND ISLANDS.

The Falkland Islands are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long.; they consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles. Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In the early part of the 18th century they were visited by many French vessels, and in 1763 they were taken possession of by France; they were subsequently held by the Spaniards till 1771, when they were for a time abandoned, and the sovereignty of them given up to Great Britain.

In 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery, and have from that time to the present so continued.

The climate is exceedingly healthy, and the inhabitants live to a great age. During the summer, a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. During the middle of the day, the wind often amounts to a gale. The mornings and evenings are delightful. In winter, the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. Ice has not been known to exceed two inches in thickness, and snow seldom lies on the low lands. The temperature, on the whole, is equable. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid.

A peculiar feature in the geology of these islands is presented in streams of stones or fragments of quartz, which appear to flow down the sides of the hills. These streams are twenty to thirty feet wide, and the stones vary in size from one to four cubic feet, and are spread out in the valleys to a great extent. Sandstone, in which are beautifully perfect impressions of shells, occurs in beds. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

Potatoes, turnips, cabbages, and many other vegetables thrive exceedingly well, and may be produced in unlimited quantities in all parts of the island. Strawberries, currants, and gooseberries, also do well. In Government House garden, which is well sheltered and kept in good order, the yield of the fruit trees is abundant.

There is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The Tusac grows to the height of seven feet with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which, the cattle get very fat. Antiscorbutes are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, sorrel, &c., cranberries, and a small red fruit, growing like the strawberry, but in appearance and taste more like a half-ripe blackberry, besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used by the sealers and Gauchos.

Rabbits abound in various parts of the islands, and inland geese, swans (black and white), wild duck dotterel, and teal are plentiful—more especially
the former. The harbours swarm during the summer months with excellent fish, and trout, weighing from one to two pounds, are to be found in the rivers and lakes of the interior.

Wild cattle, horses, and pigs are very numerous. Sheep have been introduced and found to do exceedingly well. The wool is of excellent quality and realizes a high price in the London markets. The exports consists of provisions, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, tallow, and wool, as aforesaid.

The local revenue is between 1,000l. and 1,500l. a year, the expenditure between 6,000l. and 8,000l.; the difference between revenue and expenditure being made up by Parliamentary vote.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The members of both Councils are appointed by the Crown.

**GRENADE.**

Grenada is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 76,538 acres, with a population, by the Census of 1861, of 31,900 souls. It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and between it and the latter island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, partly attached to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 3,071 souls.

The country is mountainous and very picturesque, and abounds in streams and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, 7 miles from St. George, and equidistant from Grenville and Lake Antoine, in the parish of St. Patrick, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. The chief productions of Grenada are sugar and cocoa, and those of Carriacou are cotton, ground provisions, and live-stock.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrilllas for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the Colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to the Crown of France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February,
1763. In 1779 Grenada was retaken by the French; and in 1783 Grenada was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. Major-General Edward Mathew was appointed Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of Grenada and such of the Grenadines as lie to the southward of Carriacou, including that island; and from that date to this time the government of Grenada has been confined within these limits.

In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation. In 1854 an Act was passed regulating the election of members of Assembly. This Act is now in force. The House of Assembly consists of 26 members, of whom 4 are returned for the town of St. George, 7 by the united parishes of St. George and St. John, 6 by the united parishes of St. Patrick and St. Mark, 6 by the united parishes of St. Andrew and St. David, and 3 by Carriacou.

The qualifications for Electors and Members are as follows:

For Electors.—10 acres of freehold land, of which 5 acres is in actual cultivation, or a messuage or messuages of the annual value of £10., or paying rent as lessee or renter of any plantation or lands a sum of not less than 20l. per annum, or renting a house and tenements of the value of 20l.

For Members.—A plantation or estate in his actual possession in his own or wife's right, or any greater estate therein, or for a term of not less than 99 years in severalty, or as a joint tenant, his share of which shall be of not less than 50 acres of land, 20 of which shall be cultivated; or whoever shall own any land with a dwelling-house of the annual value of 40l., or possession of an annual income of 200l. derivable from profession or trade, or being interest of money invested in the Colony.

There are 652 registered electors, and 492 voted at the last general election in February, 1862.

The Assembly is elected for seven years.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members selected by the Crown from the Legislative Council and House of Assembly. During the continuance of this Act the executive functions of the Legislative Council ceased, and were exercised by the new council. The Act has been allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council has resumed its executive functions; it is styled Her Majesty's Council.
