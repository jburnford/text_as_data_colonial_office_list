BAHAMAS.
A chain of islands lying between 21° and 27° 30' N. lat., and 70° 30' and 79° 5' W. long. The group is composed of about 20 inhabited islands and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Harbour Island, Abaco, Eleuthera, Heneagua or Inagua, Mayaguana, St. Salvador, Andros Island, Great Bahama, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Crooked Island, Long Cay, Watling's Island, the Caicos, and Turks, and the Berry Islands.

St. Salvador, one of the islands composing this chain, was the first land discovered by Columbus on his voyage in 1492. New Providence was settled by the English in 1629 and held till 1641, when the Spaniards expelled them, but made no attempts to settle there themselves. It was again colonized by England in 1666, but fell into the hands of the French and Spaniards in 1703, after which it became a rendezvous for pirates, who were in 1718 extirpated, when a regular colonial administration was established, and the seat of Government was fixed in this island. In 1781 the Bahamas were surrendered to the Spaniards, but at the conclusion of the war they were once more annexed and finally confirmed to Great Britain by the Peace of Versailles, 1783.

In 1848 the Turks and Caicos Islands were separated from the other Bahamas, and formed into a distinct Government, under the Government-in-Chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

There are ten colonial custom-houses and ports of entry in the Government of the Bahamas, viz., Nassau, Abaco, Eleuthera, Harbour Island, Little Exuma, Rum Cay, Long Island, Long Cay, Inagua, and Ragged Island, principally for the exportation of salt, one of the chief staples of these islands. A considerable quantity of pine-apples, oranges, and sponges are also exported to England and the United States.

Bahamas is the only one of the W. I. Chartered Colonies, which grants (by a recent Act) Superannuation allowances to public servants.
