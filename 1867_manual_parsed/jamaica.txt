JAMAICA.

An Island situated in the Caribbean Sea, and to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 40' and 18° 30', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 30'. It is the largest, and was formerly the most valuable of the British West Indies; being 140 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 6,400 square miles.

Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola. It capitulated, after trifling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. After the capture of the island, until the Restoration of Charles II., Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction. In 1660 the first establishment of a regular civil government was made by Charles II., who appointed G. D'Oylcy Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. In 1807 the Slave Trade was abolished, at which time there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery, in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners; being rather more than 19l. a head on a slave population of 303,338.

Climate.

There is great variety of climate; the medium heat at Kingston is about 80°, and the minimum 70° Fahrenheit throughout the year: at an elevation of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet, the average range is 55° to 65°, the minimum in winter being 44°: on the Blue Mountain Peak, ice of some thickness has been found in March. The hurricane season ranges from July to October: the periodical rains, which last about six weeks, are called the May and October seasons, but there is great irregularity in the time of their falling.

Constitution.

The Constitution, which existed for nearly 200 years in Jamaica, but which was abrogated in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The abolition of this form of government, and the substitution for it of a new form in which practically the entire control and authority is vested in the Governor, was brought about by the serious disturbances amongst the black population which occurred in October, 1865, and of which we submit the following account:—

On the 7th October, 1865, at the Petty Sessions at Morant Bay, a prisoner who had been convicted of an assault was rescued from the police. On the 9th October a warrant was issued for the apprehension of two persons named Bogle, and several others, who were stated to have taken an active part in the riot of the 7th.

These warrants were placed in the hands of a policeman, who, with five other policemen and two rural constables, proceeded early on Tuesday morning, the 10th of October, to Stony Gut, a Negro settlement about five miles from Morant Bay, where Paul Bogle and some other of the alleged rioters lived.

They found Paul Bogle in his yard, and told him that they had a warrant for his apprehension. He desired to have the warrant read to him, which was done. He then said that he would not go, and upon one of the policemen proceeding to apprehend him he cried out, "Help, here!" At the same time a man named Grant, who was with him, and was addressed as "Captain," called out, "Turn ont, men!" Almost immediately a body of men, variously estimated at from 300 to 500, armed with cutlasses, sticks, and spikes, rushed out from a chapel where Bogle was in the habit of preaching, and from an adjoining cane field, and attacked the policemen.

The policemen were, of course, overpowered. Some of them were severely beaten. Three of the number were made prisoners, and detained for several hours, and were ultimately released only upon their taking an oath that henceforth they would "join their colour," that they would "cleave to the black."

On Wednesday, the 11th of October, the Vestry, consisting of certain elected members, and of the magistrates, who were members ex officio, assembled in the Court House at Morant Bay at about 12 o'clock, and proceeded with their ordinary business till between three and four o'clock, when
notice was given that a crowd of people was approaching.

The volunteers were hastily called together, and almost immediately afterwards a body of men, armed with cutlasses, sticks, muskets, and bayonets, after having attacked the police station, and obtained possession of such arms as were there deposited, were seen entering a large open space facing the Court House, in front of which the volunteers had been drawn up. Baron Ketelhoudt went out to the steps, and called to the people to know what they wanted. He received no answer, and his cries of "Peace! peace!" were met by cries from the crowd of "War!"

As the advancing people drew near, the volunteers retired till they reached the steps of the Court House. The Custos then began to read the Riot Act. While he was in the act of reading it, stones were thrown at the volunteers, and Capt. Hitchens, who commanded them, was struck in the forehead. The captain, having received authority from the Custos, then gave the word to fire. The order was obeyed, and some of the people were seen to fall.

The volunteers were soon overpowered, and the Court House, in which refuge was sought, was set on fire. Many persons were barbarously murdered whilst trying to escape. Eighteen persons, including the Custos, two sons of the Rector, the Island Curate of Bath, the Inspector of Police, the captain, two lieutenants, a sergeant, and three privates of volunteers were killed; 31 persons were wounded.

After this the town remained in possession of the rioters. The gaolers were compelled to throw open the prison doors, and 51 prisoners who were there confined were released.

Several stores were attacked, and from one of them a considerable quantity of gunpowder was taken. Previous to the attack upon the volunteers, an unsuccessful attempt had been made to obtain gunpowder from the same store.

An attempt was made to force the door of the magazine, where about 300 serviceable stands of arms were stored. Happily the endeavour was not successful.

On the 12th October, large parties, armed with guns and cutlasses, marched in military order through Bath and other contiguous districts. Stores were pillaged, and property taken or destroyed. Blue Mountain Valley Estate, Amity Hall, Monklands, which is 16 miles from Morant Bay, and Hordley Estate, were all attacked by the insurgents, the occupiers barely escaping with their lives. At Blue Mountain Valley and Amity Hall barbarous murders were perpetrated.

It is very difficult to state the exact number of the insurgents, at one place it was put at 1,500, and at another at as many as 2,000, all or the great majority of whom were armed with various kinds of weapons.

"Colour for Colour" was the cry everywhere during the short time that the disturbances lasted.

"Blood, blood," "We want blood," was heard at one place.

"We must humble the white man before us," "We are going to take the lives of the white men, but not to hurt the ladies," was heard at another place.

During the next three days the insurgents continued their course through Port Morant northward to Manchioneal, and on to Mulatto River and Elmwood, the last of which places is situated in the most northerly part of St. Thomas-in-the-East, where that parish abuts upon Portland.

As they advanced with the cry of "Colour for Colour" they were joined by a considerable number of the blacks, who readily assisted in the work of plundering. The houses and stores were sacked. The intention also of taking the lives of the whites was openly avowed, and diligent search was made for particular individuals. But in each case the imperilled person had timely notice, and sought safety in flight.

Elmwood was the point farthest from Morant Bay to which the disturbances extended, as on Sunday the 15th the troops arrived at Port Antonio, and put a stop to the farther progress of the insurgents northwards.

Thus it will be seen that in the course of these few days the insurgents had spread over a tract of country extending from White Horses, a few miles to the west of Morant Bay, to Elmwood, at a distance of upwards of thirty miles to the northeast of that place.

They seem to have been under the impression that they would be enabled to remain in possession of the estates.

Not only were the crops uninjured, and the buildings for the most part preserved, but the intention was openly avowed of proceeding to take up the crops. Such were the intentions of the insurgents.

Before the commencement of the disturbances it is clear that meetings took place, where bodies of men were drilled, oaths administered, and the names of persons registered.

The insurgents appear to have expected that the Maroons would join them, but that singular and isolated people remained faithful to their allegiance, and assisted in the suppression of the disturbances.

The number of troops in the island at the time was about 1,000, 500 of whom only were available, the remainder being required for garrison duties.

When intelligence of the outbreak reached the Government, troops were immediately sent to the scene of action, the object being to limit the disturbances within certain bounds.

With this view, detachments composed of the West India regiments serving in Jamaica were despatched to Morant Bay and to Port Antonio, at each of which places military posts were established.

At the same time a party of the 2d Battalion 6th Regiment marched from Newcastle to proceed along the line of the Blue Mountain Valley, and endeavour to intercept the insurgents who were reported to be advancing by that route.

Seamen and marines were also landed at Morant Bay from Her Majesty's ship 'Wolverine,' who co-operated with the regular troops.

Bodies of Maroons protected Port Antonio and Bath.

Troops were also sent to Linstead in St. Thomas-in-the-Vale, about 14 miles to the north of Spanish Town; Volunteers, pensioners, and special constables were enrolled for the protection of Kingston, and for the general maintenance of order.

These military arrangements were allowed to have been apparently prompt and judicious.

By confining the insurgents to the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East and its neighbourhood the disturbances were kept in check, and were prevented from spreading to other parts of the Island.

On the 13th October Martial Law had been proclaimed throughout the county of Surrey (except the county and city of Kingston), and Governor Eyre had proceeded in person to the scene of the
disturbances, taking with him additional troops, and making arrangements for their disposition.

In the district of the Blue Mountain Valley 120 men of the 2d Battalion, 6th Regiment, under Colonel Hobbs, occupied Monklands as headquarters on Sunday, October 15th.

Monklands is a coffee estate near the head of the Blue Mountains Valley, and distant as already stated about 16 miles from Morant Bay.

Operations for suppressing the outbreak were at the same time carried on through the country on the north side of the Island.

At mid-day of October 15th Captain Hole marched from Port Antonio with 40 men of the 6th Regiment, and 60 men of the 1st West India Regiment under Ensign Cullen.

Captain Hole received orders from Brigadier-General Nelson to proceed to Manchioneal, about 20 miles eastward from Port Antonio.

On the 23rd of October Paul Bogle the ringleader was captured, he was tried and hung on the 24th.

The total number of deaths caused by those engaged in the suppression amounted to 439, and the total number of dwellings burned to 1,000, the total number of persons flogged is supposed to have been not less than 600.

The disturbances in St. Thomas-in-the-East had their immediate origin in a planned resistance to lawful authority.

The causes leading to the determination to offer that resistance were manifold:

A principal object of the disturbers of order was the obtaining of land free from the payment of rent.

An additional incentive to the violation of the law arose from the want of confidence generally felt by the labouring class in the tribunals before which most of the disputes affecting their interests were carried for adjudication.

Some, moreover, were animated by feelings of hostility towards political and personal opponents, while not a few contemplated the attainment of their ends by the death or expulsion of the white inhabitants of the Island.

Much has been said of Mr. George William Gordon, a coloured member of the Assembly. He had attended and taken a leading part in certain meetings, in different parts of the Island, which had been held in the course of the summer of 1865, and which were thought to be connected with a more or less extensive, conspiracy. He formed, moreover, the only probable link between the plotters of Stony Gut and the supposed conspirators in other parts of the Island.

Mr. G. W. Gordon attended, and spoke at a meeting held at the "Alley," in Vere, on the 4th of September. He is thus reported to have spoken, amongst other matters:—"They report to the Queen that you are thieves. . . . The notice that is said to be the Queen's advice is all trash; it is no advice of the Queen at all. . . . I was told by some of you that your overseers said that if any of you attended this meeting, they would tear down your houses. Tell them that I, George William Gordon, say they dare not do it. It is tyranny. You must do what Hayti does. You have a bad name now, but you will have a worse one then."

This is but one of the many instances in which intemperate and unwarranted language was attributed to him. Bogle, it is said, did not hesitate to speak of himself as acting in concert with Gordon.

Under these and many other circumstances, which we have not space to relate, the Governor thought fit to cause Gordon to be arrested. He was captured on the 17th October, at Kingston, tried by court-martial on the 21st, found guilty of complicity in the rebellion, and was hung at Morant Bay, on the 23rd October.

After this event, and after the suppression of disaffection in St. Thomas's-in-the-East, the Government constantly received reports of the existence in other parts of the Island of disloyalty and seditious intentions.

Governor Eyre, therefore, at the meeting of the Legislature, pointed out the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and as the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created.

The Legislature unanimously responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of Government legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

In the meantime, whilst these changes were being effected in the Colony, it was asserted in England that excessive and unlawful severity had been used in the suppression of the disturbances, and a Royal Commission, consisting of Lieut.-Gen. the Right Hon. Sir Henry Storks, the Right Hon. Russell Gurney, Q.C., and J. B. Maule, Esq., Q.C., was appointed to inquire into and report fully upon the circumstances attending the outbreak and the suppression of these disturbances.

The conclusions arrived at by the Commission were—

"That though the original design for the overthrow of constituted authority was confined to a small portion of the parish of St. Thomas-in-the-East, yet that the disorder, in fact, spread with singular rapidity, over an extensive tract of country, and that such was the state of excitement prevailing in other parts of the Island, that had more than a momentary success been obtained by the insurgents, their ultimate overthrow would have been attended with a still more fearful loss of life and property.

"That praise was due to Governor Eyre for the skill, promptitude, and vigour which he manifested during the early stages of the insurrection; to the exercise of which qualities its speedy termination is in a great degree to be attributed.

"That the military and naval operations appear to have been prompt and judicious.

"That by the continuance of martial law in its full force to the extreme limit of its statutory operation, the people were deprived for a longer than the necessary period of the great constitutional privileges by which the security of life and property is provided for.

"That the punishments inflicted were excessive. 1. That the punishment of death was unnecessarily frequent. 2. That the floggings were reckless, and at Bath positively barbarous. 3. That the burning of 1,000 houses was wanton and cruel."

Her Majesty's Government concurred in these conclusions, and whilst expressing also their sense of the promptitude and judgment with which Mr. Eyre submitted to the late Legislature his views respecting a change in the mode of the Government of the Colony; they were of opinion, on the whole, that they were taking the course best calculated to conciliate general confidence and to establish on firm and solid grounds the future
welfare of the Island by placing the Government in other hands. Mr. Eyre was therefore removed.

An Act of the Imperial Parliament and an Order in Council of the 9th April, 1866, were passed ratifying the acts of the Jamaica Legislature respecting the abrogation of the Constitution.

The present Constitution is as follows:

A Legislative Council was, by Order in Council of the 11th June, 1866, established, consisting of official and unofficial members. The official members to be the senior military officer, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Roads, and Collector of Customs, together with certain unofficial, not exceeding six in number.

There is also established a Privy Council.

The members of the Privy Council are, the Lieutenant-Governor, or senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Director of Roads, the Collector of Customs, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, who may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor, subject to the approval of her Majesty. The Governor, or in his absence, the senior Councillor present is to preside at each meeting when duly summoned, and the Governor and two members are to form a quorum. The Governor is to consult in all cases with the Councillors, excepting only when the matter to be decided would in his judgment, sustain material prejudice by consultation, or be too unimportant to require their advice; and he is to propose all questions on which they are to advise and decide; but any member may apply in writing for permission to propose a question, and a written answer, granting or refusing the request is to be returned. The Governor is authorized to act in opposition to the advice and decision of the Privy Council, “if in any case it shall appear right so to do,” and to report to the Secretary of State for the colonies, “the grounds and reasons” of his opposition, and any member may record on the Minutes the nature of the advice or opinion offered and rejected.

The President of the Privy Council is to administer the Government during the absence of the Governor, but he is not to pass any law that is not immediately necessary for the peace and welfare of the Island, without a Royal order for that purpose; neither is he to remove or suspend members of the Privy and Legislative Councils, Judges, Magistrates, or Civil or Military Officers, without concurrence of the majority of the Privy Council.

With regard to the Legislative Council, the following Rules and Regulations are to be observed, in the transaction of business and in the passing of laws. The official members are to be the same as those mentioned for the Privy Council; the Governor is to appoint one or more persons to act provisionally, as unofficial Councillor or Councillors, when the number appointed by her Majesty shall be less than six; and all the Councillors are to hold office during the Royal will and pleasure. Any member may propose questions for debate, excepting only that no law shall be enacted, nor any vote or resolution passed, nor any question admitted to debate, when the object is to dispose of or charge any part of the Revenue, unless the proposition be made by the Governor, or the proposal expressly allowed or directed by him. All laws passed are to be styled, “Laws enacted by the Governor of Jamaica, with the advice of the Legislative Council thereof.”
