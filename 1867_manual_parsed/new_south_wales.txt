NEW SOUTH WALES.

This Colony is situated on the eastern coast of the Australian continent. It is said to have been discovered by the Spaniards in 1609. It was visited by several of the early navigators, and Captain Cook explored its eastern coast in 1770. The first settlement at New South Wales was formed in 1787.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 35° 25' S. lat., and 151° 17' E. long.

The climate of New South Wales has been thus described: "It is warmer than that of England, the mean temperature at Port Jackson being 60° 6', and at Port Macquarie, 68° Fahr." In the winter, June, July, and August, snow has been known to lie on the mountains, and occasionally in the upland valleys for some days together, but it is never seen in the vicinity of Sydney or along the coast; there the winter is a season of rain and slight frosts.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool, and during late years there has been an immense increase in its export. The progress of trade and the development of commercial relations is sufficiently illustrated by the increase under the head of exports and imports.

The Colony also produces coal, silver, iron, copper, gold, cotton, and tobacco. New South Wales is supposed to contain an area of about 325,000 square miles.

In New South Wales, "responsible Government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54. The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which is to consist of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths shall consist of persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all future members, after the expiration of that term, were appointed for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council now consists of 32 members.

The Legislative Assembly, under the Electoral Law, No. 20, 22 Vict., "consists of 80 members, or so soon as the University of Sydney shall be entitled to return a member to the Assembly, of 81 members." The Colony is divided into 67 electoral districts.

Every male subject of the full age of 21, being natural born, or who, being a naturalized subject, shall have resided in the Colony for three years, shall be entitled to vote in respect of the following qualifications:

Firstly, Resident Electors.—Every such subject who at the time of making out the electoral list in any such district shall reside, and during the 6 months then next preceding shall have resided, in that district.

Secondly, Non-resident Electors.—Every such subject who shall have had within the district for the 6 months then next preceding the time of making out the electoral list, a freehold or leasehold estate, or have been in receipt of rents or profits thereof amounting to 10l., or to an annual sum of 10l.; or shall occupy a house, shop, or office, of the annual value of 10l.

Any person properly qualified and registered as a voter shall be qualified to be elected a member of Assembly. No member of Council can be a member of Assembly.

As to vote by ballot, see the 41st Sect. of Act 20—22 Vict., making due provision for that mode of voting.

The number of registered electors on the electoral roll is 107,081. 52 per cent. of the total male population have the privilege of voting for members to serve in the Legislative Assembly.
