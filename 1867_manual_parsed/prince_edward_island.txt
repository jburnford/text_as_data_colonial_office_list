PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

This island is situate between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64° W. long.; its area is about 1,380,000 acres; it is about 140 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to the Government of Nova Scotia in 1763. Prince Edward Island, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony, and its first Governor, Walter Patterson, was appointed in 1771.

The climate is milder than in the surrounding British Colonies, and it is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded. It is 130 miles in length. Its greatest breadth is 34 miles, and its area 2,130 square miles.

The inhabitants are engaged almost exclusively in agriculture.

Both these bodies are elected by the people.
