LABUAN.

The island of Labuan is on the north-west coast of Borneo, from which it is about six miles distant; it is about 30 miles from Bruni, in 5° 14' N. lat., and 115° 19' E. long.; and was ceded to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Bruni. The expense of the establishments at Labuan has been for the most part defrayed from Imperial funds. Its products at present are small, but coal of good quality abounds; it is expected that its supply will be of great service to the ships trading between Singapore and China. Labuan has a fine port; there are no duties on imports or exports.

The coal mines in the colony are leased to the China Steam Ship and Labuan Coal Company, on the following terms, under a new lease granted to them in 1865. They are to pay a rental of 300l. a year, and a royalty of 6d. per ton on all coal beyond 12,000 tons sold or disposed of for value before 25th December, 1870, and of 1s. per ton for all beyond 6,000 tons after that date. They are also to be allowed to raise ironstone, freestone, freestone, and petroleum on payment of certain royalties, and to cut timber for their own use or for any other purpose, on condition that that they keep the land from which such timber is cut free of underwood and jungle. And in consideration of their making a railway from their coal pits to the shipping place, and introducing settlers, they are to be allowed free grants of land along the course of their railway to the extent of five acres for every labourer introduced, not, however, to exceed 640 acres for each mile of railway.

The temperature varies little during the year, ordinarily the thermometer stands at 75° at day-break, and 86 during the heat of the day, the extreme ranges are from 71 to 90°.

The average fall of rain is 160 inches for the year, and it generally falls at night.

The Government is administered by a Governor and a Legislative Council, consisting of the Governor and two Justices of the Peace.

Justice is administered by the General Court, established by a Local Ordinance, which consists of a Governor as president, with two or any greater even number of Justices of the Peace. Cases of treason and murder are tried with a jury of seven persons, and a verdict may be returned by a majority of five.

Amount voted by Parliament in 1860-1 for Labuan was 6,655l.; 1862-3, 4,374l.; 1863-4, 5,250l. Amount voted 1864 and 5, 4,233l.

**MALTA.**

Malta is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. Valetta, its port and capital, is in 35° 54' N. lat., and 14° 31' E. long. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is about 95 square miles; that of Gozo 20 square miles.

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino we find mention made at very early date. They were under the dominion of the Carthaginians, from whom they were taken in the first Punic War by the Romans. On the decline of the Roman Empire, Malta fell to the Goths, and then to the Saracens. It was under the dominion of the Sicilians from 1190, and was granted early in the sixteenth century by the Emperor Charles V. to the Order of the Knights of St John, by whom it was held during a period of more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, Malta capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte. The Maltese rose, however, to expel their conquerors, the French, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they closely blockaded them for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered, and Malta was taken possession of by Great Britain. 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

The climate of Malta is somewhat peculiar. The heat there almost equals that experienced in the tropics, and lasts not only during the day, but continues almost without abatement through the night. This continuous heat for some months of the year produces a feeling amongst the residents of lassitude and oppression. The maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 61° Fahr., and the minimum 53°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the maximum is 82° Fahr., and the minimum 73°. The well-known "scirocco" is a very disagreeable wind, blowing from the south-east; it is particularly prevalent in the autumn of the year. Malta is, however, considered by some as a very healthy place of residence.

The island is highly cultivated; its principal products are cotton and corn; the vine has been grown, and oranges and figs are abundant.

The Government is administered by a Governor, who is assisted by a Council of Government, constituted by Letters Patent of 11th May, 1849, consisting of 18 members—10 official, and 8 elected, who are returned by about 2,700 electors. The Governor is President. An income of 8l. from immoveable property, or payment of a rent of 4l. per annum qualifies a person to vote.

Mauritius.

An island lying in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 17' and 57° 46' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat. It is 400 miles east of Madagascar. It comprises an area of 676 square miles.

The Mauritius was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507. They claimed possession of it during nearly the whole of the 16th century. The first who made any settlement in it were the Dutch in 1598, who named it Mauritius, in honour of their Prince Maurice. It was abandoned by them in 1710, and afterwards taken possession of by the French. Mauritius was for a long time during the war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels and Indiamen, from the facility with which sorties might be made from it upon our traders by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810. The possession of the island was ratified by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

Constitution.

The Government of the island is vested in a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, of which the Colonial Secretary, Procureur and Advocate-General, and the Officer in Command of Her Majesty’s Troops are ex-officio members. There is also a Legislative Council, consisting of seven official and ten non-official members: the former comprising the three Executive members above spoken of, and the Collector of Customs, Auditor-General, Treasurer, and Collector of Internal Revenues; the latter ten non-official members are chosen from the landed proprietors of the island, and submitted to Her Majesty in Council for approval and confirmation. The Code Civil, and the Code de Procedure Civile, which were in force at the time of the Capitulation, have so continued since, except in so far as modified by rules subsequently promulgated by the Supreme Court and Code du Commerce. The organization of the Courts of Justice was modified by Royal Order, in Council of 23rd October, 1851, under which, a Supreme Court was established, invested with the same powers as the Court of Queen’s Bench. District Courts were also authorized in each of the Districts of the Island, from which appeal lies, under certain restrictions, to the Supreme Court.

The Island of Rodrigues, the Seychelles Islands, Diego Garcia, and others, are dependencies of the Mauritius. Rodrigues is situated about 300 miles east of Mauritius. It is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth. It is cultivated by colonists from Mauritius.

The Seychelles, or Mahé Islands, are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the total number of acres comprised in this group is 50,120; the distance from Mauritius 940 miles. These islands are under the superintendence of a Civil Commissioner at Mahé, who is appointed by the Secretary of State, but is subordinate to the Governor of Mauritius, from whom he takes instructions.

*10,800l. of this expenditure was defrayed from accumulated balances.
† In 1851, the colonial and general mercantile shipping were returned together. The Census in 1851 was taken in November, when there are usually many Ships in Port; and that of 1861, in April, when the reverse is the case. These circumstances account for the apparent diminution in the shipping return notwithstanding the great increase in the commerce of the Island.

Montserrat.

This island, discovered by the celebrated Spanish navigator in 1433, was named by him after a mountain in Catalonia, to which it is said to bear a very striking resemblance.

It is situated in 16° 45' N. lat., and 61° W. long.; it is about 12 miles in length, and 8 in the broadest part; its roads however are zigzag, uphill, and down ravine, so that a journey from the town of Plymouth (lying in the centre of the south-west coast), to north or south, exceeds the extreme length of the island.

Montserrat was colonized by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants: it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782. The articles of capitulation were signed by the Lieutenant-Governor of the island, and by M. le Comte Flechin and M. le Comte de Barras. M. Louis Joseph de Goulion was appointed Commandant, who levied an impost of 1800 Johannisés, demanded a furnished residence for himself, one for the Major, and others for the Treasurer, the Commissary of Marine, for the Surgeon-Major, for warehouses of every kind, for a hospital, for a chapel for Divine service for the troops, and a residence near it for the chaplain, a residence for the keeper of the warehouses, and a chamber for his clerk. The House of Assembly provided the Governor with a furnished house, with horses, &c., &c., but refused the other demands, "as being inconsistent with the laws," as being not bound "with the terms of capitulation, and as having
no power to dispossess the inhabitants of their houses."

The island was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668.

In 1861 the Constitution was abolished, by the local legislature.

Montserrat is justly considered the most healthy of the Antilles.

The staple commodity is sugar, which until lately was brought to the town in bags on the backs of mules, or oxen. Carts are now pretty generally used, but the mule and the ox with the bag of sugar on its back is still occasionally seen. There is no harbour, but a very good roadstead.

The scenery of the island is exceedingly beautiful.

The Government is administered by a President (subordinate to the Governor-General of the Leeward Islands), aided by an Executive Council appointed by the Crown. The Legislative Assembly consists of 12 members, of which two-thirds are elected by the people, and one-third nominated by the Crown. The qualification for elective members of the Assembly is—The possession in fee simple or fee entail of an estate in the island, of the annual value of £25 per annum, or possessed of an income of the yearly value of £100.

The qualification for voters is the possession in fee simple of one acre of land, with a cottage attached, and being resident thereon, or of twenty acres of land with or without a dwelling-house, or having a freehold property of the annual value of £10 per annum, or tenant paying not less than £20. A registry of electors is not completed. The Constitution Act of 1862 gives the Officer administering the Government the power of presiding over the deliberations of this body, whenever he may consider it necessary to do so.

**Natal.**

The Colony of Natal derives its name from the fact of its discovery by Vasco de Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas-day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about eight hundred miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between 29th and 31st parallels of S.lat.: it is bounded by the Tugela and Umzimvubu Rivers, and by the Drakensberg Mountains. It comprises an area of about thirteen millions and a half of acres, and has a seaboard of one hundred and seventy miles. The scenery in Natal in parts is picturesque in the extreme; waterfalls abound. Natal is a well-watered country, no less than twenty-three distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the one hundred and fifty miles of coast, but unfortunately none of them are navigable.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco de Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it till 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The unfortunate crew spent some twelve months there engaged in building a small vessel from the fragments of the wreck. Having accomplished their task, they sailed for the Cape, leaving behind them four Englishmen, three of whom were subsequently taken off by a Dutch ship which visited the coast. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lt. Farewell, an officer of the Royal Marines, having the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonize it. Though the British Government declined to recognize or aid him in his plans, he induced some twenty enterprising individuals to join him in this undertaking. On their arrival they found Chaka, a powerful chief, of great talent, who had
absorbed into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, at the summit of his power; he sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which was broken up at his death, about four years later. The tribes thus amalgamated by Chaka have been known since under the general title of Zulus.

Towards the close of the year 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their relations with their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dirgaan, the Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to his brother Chaka. During the next two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with various success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory over the natives.

In consequence of these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape determined to take military possession of the district, and sent there a detachment of troops for the purpose. This detachment was shortly withdrawn, and after the lapse of a brief interval a second force, under Captain Smith, was sent (1840). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, and forced to entrench themselves, and were completely blockaded till the arrival of a considerable force under Colonel Cloete, when a junction was effected with the garrison under Captain Smith. The Boers shortly submitted, and on the 5th July, 1840, their signed act of submission was received by Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In 1843 the district of Natal, with the sanction of Her Majesty's Government, was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In August, 1845, Letters Patent were promulgated, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. And in November of the same year other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, as well as an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the latter continued to frame laws for Natal till 1848, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

The climate of Natal, notwithstanding its almost tropical position, is well suited to Europeans. The Colony affords a good field to the enterprising emigrant from this country.

There are various missionary establishments in Natal, supported by voluntary aid, for the advancement of the 150,000 Zulu-Kafir subjects of the Queen. The Church of England, the Wesleyans, the Americans, the Prussians, the Hanoerians, the Norwegians, and the Church of Rome, all have their various stations.

Natal perhaps is a solitary instance of a Colony having been established by Great Britain without cost to Imperial funds. In its early days it had a loan of ten thousand pounds, which has long since been repaid. Its military expenditure is, however, still paid by Great Britain, with the exception of a sum of £4,000 annually paid by the Colony as a Colonial allowance to the officers and men of the forces serving in the Colony.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, and from that time has not been under the control of the Governor of the Cape. Its affairs are administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Chief Justice, the senior Officer in Command of the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, and the Secretary for Native Affairs; and a Legislative Council, composed of four official members, viz., the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, and 12 members elected by the counties and boroughs.

The elected members of Council hold their seats for four years from date of election, unless the Council is dissolved by the Governor. There are 8 electoral districts, and possession of property to the value of 50l., or rents from property of an annual value of 10l., entitles a man to a vote; the usual provisions respecting the disqualification of aliens, and others, hold good. No person can be elected a member of Council, unless he is a duly qualified and registered elector, nor unless he shall have been invited to become a candidate for election by at least 10 electors of the county or borough which it is proposed he shall represent; nor unless such requisition shall have been transmitted to the Resident Magistrate, at least fourteen days before the election. The Constitution of Natal is regulated by the Charter of 1856.
