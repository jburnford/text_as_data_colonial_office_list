NEVIS.

(To be included in the Lieut.-Government of St. Kitts.)

This island, which is a single mountain, is situated at 17° 10' N. lat., and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English in 1628. Its area is about 20 square miles. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area about 2,464 acres, of which about 8,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea. The average height of the thermometer, 82°.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitt's, from which place it is separated by a narrow strait of about two miles in breadth.

Sugar is the chief product.

Until the commencement of 1866 the Government of Nevis was administered by a President, assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, and a Representative Assembly. In that year, however, by Act 32,
the Constitution was abolished, and in place of the Council and Assembly, a single Chamber, called the Legislative Assembly, was established, in which the Representative element was preserved, the majority of votes resting with the official members and nominees of the Crown. An Executive Council was also established for the purposes of Executive Government. These changes and the proximity of the island to that of St. Kitts led to the union, for purposes of government of that Island; and Nevis (in the instructions about to be issued to Captain Mackenzie, as Lieutenant-Governor of St. Kitts) will be included in that Lieutenant-Government. As the process of amalgamation is not yet completed, it is impossible to vouch for the accuracy of the returns of officers, &c., given under the head of Nevis.
