TOBAGO

Was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was then occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1645 James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1648 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, and settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654; who having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1659 the Courlanders were overpowered, and the Dutch remained in quiet possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and thus became proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II., but its recognition was refused by the Dutch, who were compelled to evacuate it in 1677, by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, when Louis the Fourteenth restored it to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants; and in 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers were at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce, but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillie, after a most gallant defence by the colonists; and in 1783 the island was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown; but in March, 1793, the island was captured by the British Force under Admiral Laforey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Paris in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803, by Commander Hood and General Greenfield; and in 1814, the island was finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9',
W. long. 60° 12'; distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 20 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Trinidad by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N. in 1855, is 18½ miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 32 miles long and from 6 to 12 broad, and has an area of 97 square miles, or 62,080 acres.

The formation of the island is evidently volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 20 miles in length.

Sugar, Rum, and Molasses form the principal articles of export. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were also formerly exported; and in 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 10 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town has a population of about 1,200. The mails and passengers from the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company's vessels are landed there at a distance of five miles from Scarborough. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, has good anchorage, and the only danger is from a rock called the Beef Barrel, and frequent heavy surfs. There is a lighthouse at Bacolet Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

The form of Government is a resident Lieutenant-Governor, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Barbados. There are two Legislative Houses.—the Legislative Council and the Elective Legislative Assembly. The Council is composed of seven members, selected from amongst the most respectable and influential of the inhabitants. They are appointed by the Governor, and hold their seats for life; but become disqualified if they should become bankrupt or insolvent, or public defaulters; and their seats may be vacated by absence from the Island without leave. Their deliberations are under the presidency of one of their number, appointed by the Executive; and they are attended by a Clerk and Usher.

The Assembly consists of 16 members, elected by the registered voters of the seven parishes into which the island is divided, each parish returning two representatives, and the towns of Scarborough and Plymouth one each. The qualification for a Representative is real property assessed at 50l. per annum, or a clear yearly income of 150l. sterling.

The qualification to vote is the possession of real property as Proprietor or Tenant valued at an annual value or rental of 10l. sterling.

In June, 1862, the number of registered electors was 216, but only 89 voted, and returned the 16 members by rather more than 5 votes for each representative of a population of nearly 16,000 souls. The political franchise is regulated by Act 23 Vict., cap. 7. There are 9 electoral districts. The largest number of electors in any of these districts is 35, the smallest 6. At the last election, 2 members were returned by one elector.

The first British constitution was given to the Colony in 1769, and the seat of the Legislature transferred from Georgetown, Barbados Bay, to Scarborough. The Constitution was remodelled in 1855 by a local Act, Vic. 18, cap. 7, entitled "An Act for the better Government of this Island," which, in addition to the Legislative Council and Elective Legislative Assembly, establishes a Privy Council and an Executive Committee.

The Executive Committee consists of one Member of the Legislative Council and two Members of the Elective Legislative Assembly, selected by the Lieutenant-Governor, and holding office during pleasure. Their duties are to advise and assist the Governor in the general administration of the affairs of the island, and to prepare and perfect all estimates, ways, and means. They are the official organs of communication between the Governor and the respective Legislative Chambers. They form a Board of Audit of Public Accounts, and are also Commissioners under the Hurricane Loan Act. They receive a salary of 100l. per annum each, and have a Secretary receiving also 100l. per annum. The Members of the Executive Committee sit as Privy Councillors in virtue of their office, but cease to be Members of the Privy Council on their retirement from the Executive Committee.

The English Statute Law, in so far as it is adapted to the circumstances and population of the Colony, is applicable in all cases not provided for by local enactments.

The moneys in circulation are British coins, doubloons, dollars, American eagles and dollars, and their parts, with Colonial bank-notes. The weights and measures are the British imperial.

TRINIDAD

Is an island lying to the eastward of the continent of Venezuela, between N. latitude 10° 3', and 10° 50', W. longitude 61° and 62° 4' W. of Greenwich. Its length is about 60 miles, its breadth from 40 to 44 miles. It is separated from the continent of Venezuela, by the Gulf of Paria, into which falls the northern mouths of the Orinoco. In figure it is oblong. It was first discovered by Christopher Columbus, on the 31st July, 1498; and first colonized in 1588, by the Spaniards. In 1676 the French possessed it, but it was soon restored to Spain.

On the 12th February, 1797, an expedition for the reduction of Trinidad, sailed from Martinique, on the 14th it put into Carriacou, and sailed on the following morning with some additional transports. The naval command of this Expedition was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey. The troops, numbering 6750 men, were, commanded by Sir Ralph Abercrombie.

To this armament Don. J. M. Chacon had to oppose four fine line of battle ships, manned by 1,600 seamen and marines. The land force was was less than 500 men.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's arms, and on the 18th Febr-
ruary, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Abercrombie, Harvey, and Chacon.

Don José María Chacon left the island a few days after the capitulation. He and Admiral Apodaca were, on their arrival in Spain, placed under close arrest, and on the 28th May, 1797, were tried by a Court Martial, called in Spain, a Council of War, and were honourably acquitted.

Abercrombie, after making the best arrangements that the confused state of the Colony allowed, departed two months after, leaving his Aide-de-Camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Picton, as Governor, whose first act was to institute a Council of Advice, consisting of five members.

On the 29th March, 1802, the definitive treaty of peace between England and France, and her allies, viz.: Spain and the Batavian Republic, was signed at Amiens. By the third article, all places taken during the war by Great Britain, were to be restored, save Trinidad and Ceylon; and in the fourth article, "His Catholic Majesty cedes and guarantees, in full property and sovereignty, the Island of Trinidad to His Britannic Majesty."

The area of the island is 1,754 square miles.

Port of Spain is the chief town and port of entry. This town according to the Census of 1861, contains 18,980 inhabitants, of which 8,544 are males, and 10,436 females.

The second town and port of entry is San Fernando, 26 miles south from Port of Spain, with a population of 4,429 inhabitants. There are also the minor towns of St. John, St. Joseph, and Arima, all to the eastward of port of Spain.

The harbour is considered the finest in the West Indies.

The principal articles of produce exported, are sugar, rum, molasses, cacao, coffee, and cotton. The number of sugar estates do not exceed 152, and those of cacao and coffee 700. The total extent of land under cultivation is 68,592 acres, as follows: canes, 36,739 acres; cacao, coffee, and cotton, 14,238; provisions, 9,914 acres; pasture, 6,306 acres.

The population of the island, in 1861, amounted to 84,438: 46,074 males, and 38,364 females, of the following classification:—Trinidad, 46,936; British Colonies, 11,716; United Kingdom, 1,040; Foreign 4,301; China, 461; India, 13,488; Africa, 6,035; nondescribed, 461.

By the Ordinance, No. 16 of 1841, the island was for ecclesiastical purposes in regard to the Church of England, divided into 16 parishes.

In 1849, by the Ordinance No. 8, the island was divided into divisions, counties, districts, and wards. Subsequently the Ordinance No. 14, of 1854, was passed for the purpose of regulating the appointment of wardens, the raising of local rates for local purposes, and dividing the wards into ward unions.

Under the same last-mentioned Ordinance, there is also established a Central Road Board for the general management of all matters connected with the several wards, ward unions, and road unions, with a secretary who receives a salary of 500l. per annum.

The total annual revenue of the several ward unions, for roads, bridges, schools, police, hospitals, and other local purposes, amounts to 26,894l., sterling, and the amount expended by the several wards during 1863, in respect to education, amounted to 3,163l. 15s. ld. sterling.

The towns of Port of Spain, and San Fernando, are under the jurisdiction of Borough Councils, the former consisting of fifteen elective members, the latter of seven. One of the members is annually chosen mayor.

There is an Island Post Office, amalgamated with the General Post Office. There are nine established mail routes, besides four foot routes; the total transportation of mails on these routes being 65,058 miles, at a cost of 3,454l. sterling per annum, or 1s. 0½d. per mile.

There are 21 Post Offices throughout the island, the total delivery of letters averaging annually 111,682 packet letters, and 77,673 inland ones. There are two local steam-boats for the conveyance of mails, police, and prisoners, the contract cost of which is 4,500l. per annum. The total cost of this department is 8,500l.

Several Institutions are kept up at the public expense, viz. two general hospitals, a lunatic asylum, a leper asylum, a wash-house, and a public bath house.

The soil of the island is rich, and produces, in addition to the cane, cacao, coffee, and cotton, numerous kinds of timber, and the choicest of West Indian fruits.

A pitch lake, 99 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, and is about 30 miles from port of Spain, it is of considerable value, and affords a slight revenue to the island. The largest portion of the lake belongs to the Earl of Dunonald, by lease from the Government.

Coal is also to be found in the ward of Manzanilla; it was tried on board of H. M. steamer "Buzzard," and was found to be of excellent quality.

Immigration from India and China, is fully encouraged by the Government. The amount voted in aid of that object in 1863, was 32,890l. By the census of 1861, there were 13,488 Coolies, and 461 Chinese. Since then there have been imported, in 1862, 1,967 Coolies, and 452 Chinese; and in 1863, 1,798 Coolies; in 1864 and 1865, 3,152 Coolies, and 591 Chinese; giving a total of 20,405 Coolies and 1,504 Chinese.

These immigrants (Cooles and Chinese) are located on 154 different estates. The largest number on any one estate is 206, the "Orange Grove Estate," county of St. George. The revenue collected on account of the annual outlay was, in 1863, 16,137l. sterling.

The places of worship in Port of Spain, are Trinity Church, and All Saints' Chapel, a Roman Catholic Cathedral, and three Roman Catholic Chapels, a Wesleyan Chapel, a Presbyterian, a Baptist, and a Portuguese Chapel.

The military barracks, "St. James's," are buildings, which do credit to Trinidad, spacious, and with every requisite accommodation. They were commenced on the 21st January, 1824, and completed on the 11th June, 1827, at the expense of 80,000l. sterling.

The Police Force of the island consists of an inspector, two sub-inspectors, one clerk, eight sergeants, sixteen corporals, and one hundred and thirty-four constables; the total annual cost of the establishment is 17,045l. The Prison Department consists of one inspector, one superintendent, one medical officer, a chaplain, a teacher, one overseer, two clerks, twenty-four turnkeys, and two matrons; the total annual cost of the establishment, including maintenance and keep of prisoners, and all other expenses, is 6,800l.
Return of Immigrants introduced into the Colony from 1856 to 1864, with the Number that have Returned during that Period.
