THE GAMBIA.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, it falls into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracts to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. The advantages of this noble river for carrying on trade with the natives in the interior of Africa were well known to our merchants upwards of 230 years ago.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants of Exeter to trade in this river, and in 1618 a Company was formed in this country for the purpose of carrying on the trade; the Company was not successful, and another established two years later experienced a like want of success.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, it appears that the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company; but the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary's. The distance of the principal districts and British settlements, according to a Report furnished to Government by Dr. Madden, who had been employed as a Commissioner to investigate the Western Coast of Africa in 1841, is as follows:

Miles.

From Sierra Leone to the Gambia . . . 500
Senegal to the Gambia . . . 180
St. Mary's to St. James's Island . . . 17
St. James's to Elephant Island . . . 80
Elephant to Deer Island . . . 45

142
St. Mary's to Barraconda Falls . . . 300
Barraconda to Fort St. Joseph . . . 150

From a register of the thermometer kept at the Military Hospital at Bathurst in 1821, it appears that in January of that year the maximum was 80° and the minimum of 75°, whilst in September it was 89° and 85°; at M'Carthy's Island the thermometer indicates a temperature never reached on the coast, the ordinary range from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is from 95° to 106°. But Mr. M'Donnell, (now Sir Richard Graves M'Donnell), Governor of the Gambia, in 1850 reported that for several months in the year the thermometer in the morning at Bathurst varies from 58° to 64°, and that for the greater portion of the year refreshing land and sea-breezes blow over the town; that while the number of Europeans and Americans visiting Bathurst every year is little short of 1,200, and there are often between 100 and 200 in port during the rainy season, the mortality among these casual residents was only 12 during five years.
The Governor of the Gambia exercises no authority over the population (as is done in the case of the Gold Coast) surrounding the British settlements. Bathurst is, however, a trading port of a navigable river, affording a convenient means of intercourse with the interior of Africa to a distance of several hundred miles. The trade in ground nuts is reported to have been in 1837 about 47 tons; in 1864, the value of the crop was only 78,000l. It is expected that this colony will export a considerable quantity of cotton, the attention of the natives having been drawn by the late Governor to its culture, and two tons of Egyptian cotton seed has been distributed amongst the Native Farmers along the banks of the river. 15½ tons of cotton were exported in 1864.

The settlement was at first subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, but in 1843 it was created an independent colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. In consequence of the deliberations of a Committee appointed in the summer of 1865, to inquire into affairs on the Western Coast of Africa, the Gambia and the Gold Coast were again placed under the Government of Sierra Leone. By instructions of February, 1866, addressed to the Governor-General, the government of the settlement was vested in an Administrator, assisted by a Legislative Council consisting of the Collector of Customs and the Magistrate, together with such other persons as may be from time to time named in virtue of instructions or by warrant under sign manual. All correspondence to be addressed by the Administrator to the Governor-in-Chief, who transmits it to the Secretary of State. In cases of urgency the Administrator may correspond direct with the Secretary of State. The Governor-General is instructed to visit each settlement once a year.
