BRITISH GUIANA.

This Colony is a portion of the South American continent, extending from east to west about 200 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice. It is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyn, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and north-east by the Atlantic Ocean.

This territory was first partially settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1580. It was from time to time held by Holland, France, and England. It was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, to whom it was finally ceded in 1814.

It is impossible to determine the exact area of the Colony, as its precise boundaries are undetermined between Venezuela and Brazil respectively, but it has been computed to be 76,000 square miles.

Under the Dutch Demerara and Essequebo had constituted one Government, and Berbice another, which arrangement indeed continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and he was assisted by a council of six; any vacancy occurring being filled by the Governor's selection of one out of two nominations submitted by the remaining councillors. In the year 1817, however, an order was made by the Prince Regent in Council, requiring three nominations to be made in lieu of two for the Governor's selection, and also declaring that if no such nomination were made in fourteen days, the Governor should be entitled to appoint absolutely to the vacancy. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Demerara appears to have been established in 1773, and in 1789 that for Essequebo merged into it, and the seat of Government for the United provinces was established at Stabroek, the site of the present metropolis, Georgetown; under these circumstances, disputes having arisen between the Colonists and the local Government, and West India Company, as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed, being in fact the draft of a new constitution, was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, and on their arrival in 1789 they dissolved the then existing Government, and established a new one for the conjoined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and 1802 and its cession in 1803, the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before. It is, therefore, advisable now to advert to the leading provisions of that document.

The Council or Court of Policy was to consist of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

The Members (unofficial) were to be chosen "from among the principal, most capable, and most religious inhabitants, above twenty-five years of age, professing the Protestant religion, and perfectly acquainted with the Dutch language, and who had resided at least three years within the Colony." It will be essential to bear in mind, that no other definition of the qualification of a Member of the Court of Policy has existed to this moment inapplicable as the preceding obviously is to the altered state of things. There was in addition a provision against the
eligibility of parties within certain degrees of consanguinity, which, however, has been practically disregarded.

By a Proclamation of Governor Beaujon in 1796, it was enacted that any person duly elected and declining to serve, should be liable to a penalty of three thousand guilders, unless he had served within two years next preceding his election.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each Colony,* each consisting of seven Members elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned or ceased to be an inhabitant. The Kiezers, before proceeding to a nomination, were to be sworn to the faithful discharge of their office before the Director-General a ceremony which continued to be observed before the Governor until the passing of Ordinance No. 16 of the present year.

A periodical change in the constitution of the Council or Court of Policy was secured by providing that the Senior Colonial Member should retire yearly.

The Director-General was to be allowed a double vote, and the Secretary of Demerara was to be the "Minister of the Court of Policy."

Such seems to have been the original Legislative Constitution of the Colony. We now come to the occasion on which what are termed "Financial Representatives" were added.

It appears that in 1795 it was deemed necessary during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have jointly with the Court of Policy the administration of the Public funds.† In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon thought fit to annul that arrangement, and to enact that to secure to the inhabitants a more ample representation at the raising of taxes, in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers and to serve for two years, but whose powers should be strictly limited to the raising, with the Court of Policy, Colony taxes and examining also with that body the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation, however, was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the Financial Representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proceeding remained operative though unconfirmed by the Crown until 1831, when Sir Benjamin D'Urban became Governor of the United Colony, and it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

Such is the state of things which has remained up to the present time with the exception, in regard to the franchise hereafter to be noticed and from which the inference seems to be clear, that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.*

The inherent right of the Financial Representatives to exercise this power, has been however strongly maintained by the Colonial Members upon all occasions, and this has led to collisions between the Executive and the Elective section of the Court.† The position they assume is based upon the construction of certain passages in a decree of the States-General, dated 27th August 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves," and in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793. "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a greater number of the Colonists, for example the Kiezers of both rivers," and also upon the nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806. They do not appear to bear out the claim of right which has been founded upon them, since the evidence throughout seems to proceed upon the assumption that due provision has been previously made for the Sovereign's Chest, which is represented by the modern Civil List.

The foregoing is a succinct but sufficiently accurate sketch of the Legislative Constitution, as it existed up to the year 1849, when the first step in the process of amelioration was affected by the passing of the Ordinance, No. 15, for regulating the elective franchise, and dividing the Colony into Electoral districts.

The great principle of the whole system of Government is evidently centralization. Until the year 1826, there existed not even local subdivisions of the Colony. Demerara and Essequebo were then distributed into ten Parishes, and the same process was subsequently applied to Berbice. This arrangement, however, was simply ecclesiastical, involving no civil authority or jurisdiction, for the Members of the Vestries, constituted to administer them, were, and still are, nominated from time to time by the Court of Policy, while the combined Court grants the only funds at their disposal whether for maintenance of the fabric, or support of the poor, exclusive of what trifling income may be derived from the seat rents of the Churches.

It was not until 1837 that the first municipal body was incorporated, nor has the principle since been materially extended in its application although some advance has undoubtedly been made.

In the year 1855, under the administration of Governor Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed, to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty. Since that time no legislation has been attempted in the same direction until the passing of Ordinance not of the present year, which, however, is a mere declaratory act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of the present year, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

* During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.

† Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial Representative, 1832.
The Constitution may be summed up very briefly. It consists of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of the Executive and Legislative Councils, and of the Assembly, are performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, assisted by the six Financial Representatives for certain purposes.

The Court of Policy is composed of five official and five elective members. The official members are the Governor, the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General, the Administrator-General, and the Government Secretary, who is also Secretary to the Court. The elective members are chosen as follows:—When a vacancy occurs the seven Kiezers, who are chosen for life, meet and submit to the Court of Policy the names of two persons, from whom one is selected by the Court. All laws are enacted by this body, which also takes a prominent part in the general administration of the affairs of the Colony.

The Constitution, however, requires that for the purpose of voting the annual expenditure and framing the taxes, they shall call to their assistance the six Financial Representatives, during whose attendance the Court is called the Combined Court. The Colony is divided into five Electoral Divisions, each of which has its Kiezer or Kiezers chosen for life, and one or more Financial Representatives, elected for two years, and eligible for re-election.

| Electoral Division | Representatives, Electors |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 County of Demerara | 1 Kiezer 1 Financial 88 |
| 2 City of Georgetown | 2 " 1 " 288 |
| 3 County of Essequibo | 2 " 2 " 147 |
| 4 County of Berbice | 1 " 1 " 32 |
| 5 Town of New Amsterdam | 1 " 1 " 50 |

In the Colony of British Guiana the Roman Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now the same as that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is not the intervention of a Grand Jury.

There is no House of Assembly or Executive Council.

The aboriginal Indians were estimated in 1851 at about 7,000; but the best authority in the Colony, Mr. M'Clintock, Superintendent of Rivers and Creeks, Pomeroon District, carries the number now as high as 20,000 or 21,000. He is of opinion, that the return in 1851 was greatly under-estimated, and that the disturbances in Venezuela have caused large accessions to the numbers of the tribes within the British territories.
