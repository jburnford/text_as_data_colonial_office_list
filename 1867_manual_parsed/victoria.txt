VICTORIA.

This territory was formerly a portion of New South Wales, from which it was severed and erected into a separate Colony by the Imperial Act of Parliament 13 & 14 Vic. cap. 59. Victoria is bounded on the north and north east by a straight line drawn from Cape Howe to the nearest source of the river Murray, thence by the course of that river to the eastern boundary of South Australia, or 141° E. long., thence to the sea; on the south by the sea, a distance of about 700 miles, to Cape Howe, including the islands along the coast; area, 86,831 square miles. The total extent of land occupied at the end of 1863 was 5,554,531 acres, of which 507,798 acres were under cultivation, producing wheat, oats, barley, tobacco, vines, &c.; 120,834 gallons of wine were manufactured in 1863. Total live stock in the Colony, 1864: Sheep, 8,406,234; Cattle, 640,625; Horses, 117,182; Pigs, 113,530. 30,000,000 lbs. of wool exported in 1864.

The climate is said to be of an intermediate character, somewhat between those of New South Wales and Tasmania; not so hot as the former in summer, nor so cold as the latter in winter. There is a good deal of cold and wet weather during the three winter months; in summer the heat is tempered by cold breezes, the night always being cool, excepting during the prevalence of hot winds. The temperature at Melbourne may be said to average from 65° to 74° Fah. in the month of January, and in June 50° to 56° Fah.

Note.—Vancouver’s Island.—See British Columbia and page 120.
The Government of Victoria consists of a Governor appointed by the Crown, who is aided in the conduct of public affairs by a responsible Cabinet. There is a Legislative Council of 30 members elected for six Provinces, and an Assembly of 78 members returned by the 49 Electoral Districts: this Constitution was established by an Act passed by the Legislature of Victoria, 1854, to which Her Majesty assented, in pursuance of the power granted by Act of Parliament 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 55. One of the Members of Council returned for each of the Electoral Provinces retires in rotation at the expiration of every two years. The qualification of Members is possession of freehold property worth 5,000l., or annual value of 50l. The qualification of Electors or Members of Council is possession of freehold worth 1,000l., or annually 100l. Graduates of Universities within the British dominions, barristers and solicitors, legally qualified medical practitioners, officiating ministers of religion, certificated schoolmasters, and officers of the army and navy when not on active service, also have votes for the Legislative Council, as well as the occupiers of leasehold property of the clear value of 1,000l., or the annual value of 100l. The functions of the Upper House differ very slightly from those of the House of Lords. Money Bills may be either accepted or rejected, but they may not be altered.

An Act was passed in 1857, No. 12, to abolish the property qualification required of Members of the Legislative Assembly, and universal suffrage exists so far as the election of that body is concerned. Acts 11 and 12, 19 Vict., and the Act 279, 29 Vict., ("The Electoral Act, 1865"), it is therein provided that freeholders of an estate of the value of 50l., or of the yearly value of 5l., are qualified to vote in the election of members of the Legislative Assembly for the electoral district in which such lands or tenements are situate. Ratepayers on the "Rate-paying Roll" are also entitled to vote in the election of members for the district in which they are rated. The duration of an Assembly is three years. Vote by ballot is regulated by the Act 27 Vict., No. 181.

**VIRGIN ISLANDS.**

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of rocks; the largest island in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The Danes also possess some of them; the more important of which are St. Thomas, St. John, and Santa Croix; whilst the Spaniards lay claim to those near Porto Rico.

A civil government, and courts of justice, were established in the British Islands in 1773.

Like most of the West India Colonies, the Virgin Islands had till lately its Legislative Council and House of Assembly; that is to say, its two Legislative Chambers; but in 1854 and 1859, by Local Acts, considerable changes were effected by forming both Chambers into one Legislative Council, of which four members are elected and three nominated by the Crown. This Council is presided over by an officer appointed by the Crown, and styled, "The President Administering the Government of the Virgin Islands." This officer, who is the head of the Executive on the spot, is subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Leeward Islands, resident at Antigua.

The qualification of Candidates for the Legislative Council is as follows:—full age, and a natural born or naturalized British subject. For a Voter, possession of freehold estate of annual value of 5l. at least, or leasehold of at least 10l. annual value, or occupation of a house or tenement of 5l. annual rental value. The qualification must have been in force for at least six months before the last registration. The registered voters in July, 1866, numbered 6. The ordinary duration of the Legislative Council is three years, and the political franchise is regulated by the Constitution Act of 1859.

Sugar is made in a small quantity in the Virgin Islands, and recently many of the landed proprietors have planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly, and appears likely to prove remunerative.
