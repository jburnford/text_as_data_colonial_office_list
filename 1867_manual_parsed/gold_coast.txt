GOLD COAST.

Gold Coast is the name generally given to a portion of Upper Guinea, between 5° and 4° 20' E. long., stretching along the Gulf of Guinea from the River Assini on the west to the River Volta on the east, between which points are the settlements of Apollonia, Axim, Dix Cove, Elmina, Cape Coast Castle, Anamaboe, Apam, Accra, Christiansborg, and Fredericksborg. In 1750 the African Company was constituted by Act of Parliament, with liberty to trade and to form establishments on the west coast of Africa, between 20° N. and 20° S. lat.: from the year 1750 to 1807, the parliamentary grant for the forts and settlements on this coast averaged 13,500l. per annum, and was augmented in 1807 to 23,000l. per annum. In 1821 the forts and settlements, which had been previously vested in the African Company, were transferred to the Crown, and on the recommendation of Sir Charles M'Carthy, at that time the Governor of Sierra Leone, four forts only were retained, viz., Cape Coast Castle, Anamaboe, Dix Cove, and Accra. In 1827, in consequence of the heavy expenses incurred by the Government on account of the Ashantee War which broke out in 1824, and the decline of commerce on the coast, the public establishments were withdrawn from the coast: this arrangement some years afterwards was abandoned, and the whole coast was again placed under the direct control of the Home Government. (See the Evidence before a Select Committee which sat in the beginning of the year 1842.) In 1843 Captain Illill, R.N., was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Gold Coast, the forts still remaining dependencies of Sierra Leone. In 1847 Captain Winniett succeeded Captain Illill; he reported a great general improvement in the settlements acknowledging British jurisdiction during the last ten years, and he calculated the natives coming under that jurisdiction at not less than 275,000, scattered over a territory of about 6,000 square miles.

It is an interesting fact that these settlements, which were originally occupied as slave-factories,
are now maintained as the most effectual check on the slave-trade, and as centres from which commerce, carrying with it civilization and Christianity, may extend to the interior of Africa.

The British territory consists of a large number of forts and posts, many of them abandoned or in ruins, which have come into our possession either by settlement, capture, or purchase during the last 200 years, together with the line of the sea-coast adjacent to them. Beyond this the British Government has no dominion; but British influence extends over an area variously estimated at from 6,000 to 8,000 square miles, inhabited by a population estimated at from 250,000 to 400,000 people. Justice is administered to this large population by their own consent, and under the sanction of an Act of Parliament, by British magistrates.

The Government of the Gold Coast, in 1850, ceased to be under that of Sierra Leone, when Sir William Winniett was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief; an Executive and Legislative Council were established, the former consisting of the Judicial Assessor, the Collector of Customs, and the Colonial Secretary; the latter of two Government officers and two gentlemen, nominated by the Crown.

In consequence, however, of the deliberations of a Committee appointed in 1865, to inquire into the affairs on the West Coast of Africa, the Gold Coast was again made subject to the Government of Sierra Leone. By instruction addressed to the Governor General, dated February, 1866, the Government of the Gold Coast was vested in an Administrator, aided by a Legislative Council, consisting of the Collector of Customs, the Police Magistrate, and such other persons as might be named under instructions, or by warrant under sign manual. All laws passed by the Council are subject to the concurrence of the Governor General, and all correspondence for transmission to the Secretary of State is addressed to that officer, unless of very great urgency.
