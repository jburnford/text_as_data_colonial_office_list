HELIGOLAND.

An island situated in the North Sea, in 7° 51' E. long. and 54° 11' N. lat., opposite, and about 25 miles from, the mouth of the Elbe. Area, inclusive of the adjacent island termed "Sandy," three-quarters of a square mile; population in 1866, 2,080.

The island is governed by a Governor appointed by the Crown, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council, and a popular Assembly termed Combined Court, a form of government inaugurated by an Order of Her Majesty in Council dated the 7th of January, 1864.

The inhabitants formerly existed solely from fishing; but since 1840 Heligoland has become a fashionable bathing-place, and the old seafaring population of the island are rapidly decreasing, as the Heligolanders now turn their attention to building and letting lodging-houses, on the proceeds of which they exist through the winter months.

Within the last year, under the terms of a new Ordinance, the Oyster Bank, which has been unfinished for years, has been re-opened, and promises to become a very considerable article of export; but beyond this there are no articles of export or import at Heligoland beyond what are required for the personal use of the inhabitants.

The public debt is for this small colony very heavy; but a certain amount of taxation having been introduced, and other financial arrangements inaugurated, it is to be hoped that a constant improvement will be shown.

The Republic of Central America frequently claimed the power of restricting the limits of the Colony of Honduras; but this claim was resisted, on the ground that the rights of Sovereignty accruing to Old Spain did not devolve upon any of the Republics; and when the Republic of Central America was itself broken up into five separate republics, it became still more obvious that the mutual obligations contracted by England and Spain were thenceforth impossible to be fulfilled by the new States, even if they had not been theretofore determined.

In 1850, when the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was under discussion, it was particularly stipulated that the promise of Great Britain not to colonize or occupy Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast, or any part of Central America, did not apply to the settlement of British Honduras.

In recent years, and apart from questions of the nature to which we have referred, some apprehension has been caused from time to time by the occasionally disturbed state of the northern frontier, owing to the extinction of Spanish-Mexican and other civilized authority in that portion of Yucatan. This was the result of a barbarous warfare, which lasted some years; and ended in the capture of Bucalar by the Indian Chief Puc, and the massacre of many of the inhabitants under circumstances of singular atrocity,—a catastrophe which led to the settlement on the British side of the Hondo, of some thousands of Spanish-Mexican refugees, who have placed themselves under the protection of British power. The mutual inroads and aggressions of these refugees, and the Santa Cruz and Chichanha Indians, have given a great deal of trouble, within the last two or three years, to the British authorities. The Spanish-Mexicans of Merida and Campechi, the principal towns of Yucatan, are said to recognize the authority of the New Central Government of the Emperor Maximilian, which is also ostensibly at least recognized by the Chichanha Indians, under Luciano Zuc. It is believed that the object of the Government of Yucatan is to subjugate, with the assistance of Zuc and his followers, the Santa Cruz Indians, who still maintain their independence in the centre and on the east coast of the Peninsula.

The Government of Honduras is administered by a Lieut.-Governor (who is subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica), assisted by an Executive Council appointed by the Crown. In 1853, an Act was passed, entitled "An Act to amend the System of Government of British Honduras," by which it is provided that the Legislature shall consist of the Superintendent (now Lieutenant-Governor), and a Legislative Assembly of 18 elected and 3 nominated members.

The number of registered electors is 127; 96 only voted at the last election. The qualification for voters is ownership of realty of annual value of 7L sterling or upwards; occupation, for 6 months previously to registration, of land or house at rent of 7L sterling or upwards per annum; receipt at time of and for 6 months previous to registration of salary at the rate of 100L a year or upwards. January is fixed for the regular meeting. The regular session generally lasts for 6 or 8 weeks. The ordinary and maximum duration of an Assembly is 4 years. The franchise is regulated by Act 16 Vict., cap. 4.

Tobacco has been grown with great success, and steps have been taken for the cultivation of Cotton. The accounts are kept in dollars and cents. A Volunteer Force has been lately formed.
