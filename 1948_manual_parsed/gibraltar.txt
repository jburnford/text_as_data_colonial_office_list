GIBRALTAR

Situation and Area

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, in N. lat. 36° 6' 30", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". It consists of a long, high mountain called "The Rock," and a very flat sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the "North Front." Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile. Its area is 1¼ square miles.

Climate

The general climate of Gibraltar is mild and temperate, though somewhat hot and oppressive during the months of July and August. The rainy season is spread over the period from September to May; the annual average rainfall is 35 inches.

General Description

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called "The Bay of Gibraltar," which is about 4 or 5 miles across and affords good anchorage for shipping passing through the Straits. The eastern and northern faces of the Rock form an inaccessible precipice rising abruptly from the sea. At the northern end, between Gibraltar and the Spanish town of La Linea, lies the North Front, on which a landing ground was completed during the course of the war. From the northern end, the Rock runs southward to the ancient site of O'Hara's Tower, from which it slopes gradually till it terminates in a perpendicular cliff about 100 feet high at the water's edge at Europa; these cliffs are continued along the western face to the New Mole, beyond which the Fortress is protected by artificial ramparts. Behind these latter lines lies the larger portion of the town, covering an area of only ½ by ¼ mile. Between this part of the town and the southern portion is a picturesque public garden called "The Alameda." The civil population of the southern part of the town is confined to the east and south sides of the South mole, the remainder of the southern portion of the Rock being taken up with barracks, hospitals, etc., for the Military and the Navy. The Naval harbour is part of the west side of the Rock. It is formed by three separate moles known as the "North," "Detached," and "South" moles. The North Mole runs westward from Devil's Tongue for about 2,900 feet and then southwards, giving a total length of over a mile. The South Mole projects into the sea for a distance of 3,660 feet in a north-west direction. The Detached Mole, 2,717 feet long, is so situated between these two moles as to form a breakwater and leave two means of exit and entrance. The harbour contains a water area of 440 acres. There are three large graving docks for Naval purposes and a small dock which is available for merchant vessels of light draught.

History

Gibraltar was known to the ancients as Mons Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules, the other being Mount Abyla, or Apes Hill, on the opposite coast of Africa. It was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain.

In 711 the Moorish Chief Tarik-Ibn-Zeyad landed on the Rock, and gave it the name of Gibel-Tarik, or Mountain of Tarik, of which the name of Gibraltar is a corruption. It remained in Moorish hands until 1309, when it was seized by the Spaniards. In 1333 it was again taken by the Moors, but was wrested from the Moslem dynasty in 1462 and reverted to the dominion of Spain.

In 1704, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to retake Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779–83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

Constitution

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 12th September, 1922, by a Governor aided by an Executive Council composed of four official and three unofficial members. The power of legislation is vested in the Governor who is also the General Officer Commanding the Garrison. It was announced on 3rd November, 1945, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies was prepared to agree to the establishment of a Legislative Council in Gibraltar as soon as circumstances permit.

Population (Civilian)

ADMINISTRATION

The revenue of the colony is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, licence duties and fees and import duties.

The present Customs Tariff includes import duties on wines, liquors, spirits, including perfumed spirits, and tobacco with Empire preferential rates, and on motor spirit.

The management of the drainage, water supply, etc., is in the hands of the City Council, a body which, by legislation enacted in 1945, now contains for the first time in its history a popularly elected majority. Their receipts for 1946 were £294,148, their expenditure £275,178 and their debt on 31st December, 1946, £101,884.

RELIGION

The large majority of the civilian population are Roman Catholics.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The legal tender of the colony is composed of local Government notes and United Kingdom silver and copper coinage.

Colonial Government currency notes were in circulation to the value of £952,515 at 31st December, 1946.

The issue is governed by the Currency Note Ordinance and is of the following denominations:

- £5
- £1

COMMUNICATIONS

Postal

Air mail correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom twice a week. Transmission time is two days.

Ordinary correspondence is received from and despatched to the United Kingdom by sea. Time in transit averages 14 days.

Air mail services exist to most countries and facilities are being extended as world conditions improve.

A daily service is maintained with the continent of Europe and North Africa.

Telegraphs

The Government land lines connecting Gibraltar with Spain are worked by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., who have a station at Gibraltar. Telegrams are accepted for all parts of the world.

Telephones

The telephone system is under the control of the City Council. Telephone communication is at present restricted to the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Spanish Morocco and Tangier.

The local Naval and Military departments have their own lines which are connected with the City Council scheme.

Roads

The upkeep of roads is in the hands of the City Council in whom they are vested by law.

There are no railways or tramways in Gibraltar.

Shipping

Owing to its geographical position, Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and a coaling station by vessels of every nationality. The voyage between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom takes about four and a half days.

There is a daily steamer service between Gibraltar and the town of Algeciras on the opposite side of the Bay as well as a weekly service with Tangier.

Air

B.E.A. operate a twice-weekly service between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom via Madrid and Bordeaux.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

Education has been compulsory since 1917. Government assumed full responsibility for education in the Colony in 1944 on the repatriation of the civil population. A Director of Education has been appointed and fully qualified teachers, both religious and lay, have been recruited from the United Kingdom on Government contracts. There are at present four secondary and ten primary and infants schools in operation with a total number of pupils at 31st December, 1946, of 2,298. Government expenditure on education in 1946 amounted to £39,494 whilst estimated expenditure in 1947 is £53,847.

Medical

The medical services of the colony were completely reorganised as the result of recommendations made by a committee appointed to consider the matter in 1943. One of the most important of the committee's recommendations, the establishment of an ante- and post-natal clinic in charge of a medical officer with the special qualifications required, has been put into effect, and the King George V (Chest) Hospital under the charge of a medical officer with specialist qualifications in diseases of the lung has also been opened.

Labour and Social Welfare

Mr. K. L. Sanders, seconded from the Ministry of Labour and National Service, assumed duty as Commissioner of Labour in March, 1946. A Manpower Office established in 1940 under Defence Regulations providing for the direction of labour into essential occupations, which Regulations were abrogated in March, 1946, is in process of reorganisation as a permanent Central Employment Exchange. The labour legislation in force covers the following subjects: employers' liability in cases of industrial injury; regulation of the conditions of employment of women, young persons and children; regulation of the hours of employment of shop assistants; provision for the fixing of minimum wages, and prohibition of deductions from wages. A Trade Unions and Trade Disputes Ordinance, based on the Model Ordinance for the Colonies, was enacted in July, 1947. Approval has been given to the enactment of an Ordinance to amend the Shop Hours Ordinance in order to reduce the maximum permissible weekly hours of employment of shop assistants from 66 to 48. An Ordinance to provide for the establishment of employment exchanges and for the registration thereof of persons employed as workers is in an advanced stage of preparation. A draft Workmen's Compensation Ordinance is also
under consideration. The preparation of other social legislation has been retarded by the lack of accurate statistics relating to employment and unemployment; accordingly a small statistics section has been formed to remedy this deficiency. In the absence of legislation providing for unemployment insurance and old age pensions, a non-statutory system of public assistance has been instituted. Pending introduction of a Bill providing for the statutory notification of accidents a system of voluntary reporting of accidents by both official and private employers was commenced early in 1947. This is providing valuable information which will be used in assessing contribution and benefit rates to be payable under the draft Workmen's Compensation Ordinance. Conditions of employment of workers employed by the three Service Departments and the Colonial Government are co-ordinated by a Standing Wages Committee presided over by the Commissioner of Labour, on which the Service Departments and the Chamber of Commerce are represented. Following revision of basic wage rates and cost of living allowances approved by the Service Departments and the Colonial Government in April, 1947, the rates payable to various classes of labour employed by these Departments and the Colonial Government have been co-ordinated and unified. The recent enactment of Trade Union Legislation will facilitate implementation of the proposal to establish a Joint Labour Advisory Committee. A policy of full employment for British subjects has been maintained by giving preference in the filling of notified vacancies to British subjects. By these means the percentage of unemployment amongst male British subjects has been maintained at the very low level of less than half per cent. The demand for labour, particularly in building trades in which there is considerable activity arising from the execution of the Government post-war building programme, is constantly rising and has necessitated drawing increasingly upon alien labour. Industrial relations are generally amicable between the local Trade Unions and official and private employers, and claims relating to conditions of employment have usually been settled by direct negotiation if related to small groups of workers or individuals; whilst claims relating to large groups of workers employed by the Service Departments or the Colonial Government have been referred to the Standing Wages Committee.

There were no strikes in 1946. In the early months of 1947 a 44-hour working week was adopted by the Service Departments, the Colonial Government and City Council. A Labour and Social Welfare Bulletin has been issued and was well received by local employers' and workers' organizations. Monthly computations of the cost of living index are made and the average working class index for 1946 was 172 compared with 100 in July, 1939.

A Social Welfare Committee has been formed under the Chairmanship of the Social Welfare Office to co-ordinate the welfare activities of voluntary charitable societies and the Government, and to enquire into welfare matters affecting the Colony.

There was introduced during 1946 a Public Assistance Scheme on an ad hoc basis to grant financial aid in cash or kind to those destitute with no relatives to assist them. There has been in addition for the past three years a maintenance scheme similar to that in force in United Kingdom to assist persons who contract pulmonary tuberculosis to undergo treatment. These schemes are administered by the Welfare Officer who also acts as a link regarding welfare matters with the Employment Exchange, Resettlement Board and the Police, Medical and other departments.
