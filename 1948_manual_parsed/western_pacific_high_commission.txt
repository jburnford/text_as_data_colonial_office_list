WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH COMMISSION

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order-in-Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order-in-Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised power. In 1893 a new Order-in-Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order-in-Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony and the British Solomon Islands protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a judicial commissioner.

Deputy commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions, all decisions of the High Commissioner's court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (including the Phoenix and Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY

Situation and Area:

The Colony consists of three main groups of islands, the 16 Gilbert Islands lying between 4° North and 3° South and between 171° East and 175° East, the 9 Ellice Islands between 5° South and 11° South and 176° East and 180° East, and the 8 Phoenix Islands between 20° South and 5° South and 170° West and 174° West. The outlying islands consist of Ocean Island some 250 miles to the west of the Gilbert group and the Line Islands approximately 1,800 miles to the east.

The Gilbert group comprises the following islands:
- Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Aranuka, Nonouti, Tabiteua, Beru, Nikunau, Onotoa, Tamana and Arorae.

The Ellice Islands are Nanumea, Nanumanga, Niutao, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Niulakita.

The Phoenix Islands consist of Birnie, Canton, Enderbury, Gardner, Hull, McKean, Phoenix and Sydney Islands.

The Line Islands are Fanning, Washington and Christmas.

The area of Ocean Island is about 1,500 acres and the aggregate area of land in the whole colony amounts to less than 200 square miles.

Climate:

The climate of all groups is fairly healthy for Europeans but many of the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. Rainfall during the year 1945 amounted to 53.49 inches at Tarawa and 118 inches at Funafuti. The wettest months are usually December, January and February, while the months of least rainfall are September and October. In normal seasons the annual rainfall varies from 40 inches in the vicinity of the equator to about 100 inches in the northern Gilbert Islands and 120 inches in the southern Ellice Islands. The annual range of temperature is small.

General Description:

Ocean Island is an elevated cone, rich in phosphate of lime and attaining a height of 280 feet above sea level. All the other islands are coral atolls varying from 2 to 50 miles in length. Of these, none rises much higher than 15 feet above sea level or exceeds five furlongs in width. The soil is poor but most islands are heavily wooded with coconut palms.

History:

The Gilbert Islands were first discovered by Europeans in 1765 when Byron sighted the island of Nikunau. Further discoveries were made in 1788 by Gilbert and Marshall who visited most of the northern islands of the group, in 1799 by Bishop, in 1809 by Patterson and in 1824 by Dumery. In 1841 two ships of the United States Exploring Expedition visited many of the Gilbert Islands.

The first European settlers were mainly deserters from ships, a number of whom engaged in trading with the natives. By the sale of liquor and firearms they added to the lawlessness of the period and to the savagery of the frequent wars in which the Gilbertese, impelled by lack of sufficient land for their population, had been long engaged. In 1857 Dr. Hiram Bingham of the American Board of Foreign Missions landed at Abaiang and established the first Christian mission. The London Missionary Society which eventually took over from the American Board of Foreign Missions began work in the southern part of the group in 1870 and the Sacred Heart Mission in the central islands in 1888.

The first certain European discovery in the Ellice group was in 1781 when Maurelle discovered Nanumea, though it is possible that Mendana may have sighted one of the islands in 1568. Further discoveries were made by Patterson in 1809, Peyster in 1819 and the Wilkes Expedition in 1841. Missionary work was begun by the London Missionary Society, operating from Samoa, in 1860. The Ellice Islands suffered much from the depredations of the "black-birders" during the second half of the nineteenth century, some of the islands being almost depopulated.

In the Phoenix group, Canton Island was visited by H.M.S. "Curacao" (Captain Gideon) in the 1850s, and in 1854 the New Bedford whaler "Canton" was wrecked on the south-eastern reef. Gardner Island was discovered by Coffin in 1828 and Hull Island by the Wilkes Expedition in 1840. Guano diggers visited the group towards the end of the nineteenth century, but the works have been long abandoned.

Christmas Island was discovered by Captain James Cook in 1777. In 1798 both Fanning and Washington Islands were visited by Captain Fanning of the American whaler "Betsy".

A British Protectorate was proclaimed over the Gilbert and Ellice groups by Captain Davis of H.M.S. "Royalist" in 1892. In 1915 the protectorate became a colony, and its boundaries were extended to include Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands in 1916, Christmas Island in 1917 and the Phoenix Islands in 1937. An Anglo-American condominium was established over Canton and Enderbury Islands in 1939.

On the establishment of the protectorate an era of peaceful development ensued, and medical and educational services were developed. The increasing population of the Gilbert Islands made it necessary to find an outlet for expansion and the interests of Messrs. Burns, Philp (South Sea) Co., Ltd., in Hull, Sydney and Gardner Islands in the Phoenix group were acquired in 1937, and these islands were colonised by Gilbertese settlers the following year.

Commercial expansion has consisted mainly of the working of the phosphate deposits on Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners and the operation of coconut plantations on Fanning and Washington Islands by Fanning Island Plantations, Ltd. In 1914 the Central Pacific Coconut Plantation, Ltd., of London, were granted the exclusive right to occupy Christmas
Island but since 1940 the plantations on this island have been operated by the Colony Government. A mid-ocean relay station of Cable and Wireless, Ltd., was established on Fanning Island in 1902.

From early in December, 1941, on the outbreak of war with Japan, and during the early months of 1942, Tarawa and Butaritari were raided at intervals by Japanese warships and Ocean Island was bombed by Japanese aircraft which also made occasional bombing raids on islands of the Gilbert group. All non-natives, with the exception of two Government officers (Cartwright, Administrative Officer, and Third, Wireless Officer), two British Phosphate Commissioners' representatives (Cole and Mercer) and two Sacred Heart Mission personnel (Father Pujebet and Brother Brummel), were evacuated from Ocean Island in the French destroyer "Triomphante" on 1st March, 1942. In August and September, 1942, Japanese Naval forces occupied Ocean Island and the Islands of Tarawa, Butaritari and Abemama, and visited all the other islands of the Gilbert Group and took away as prisoners of war a number of Europeans who had remained in these islands. All these Europeans, to the number of 22, were murdered by the Japanese at Tarawa in October, 1942. The six Europeans who remained in Ocean Island were brutally treated by the Japanese and were all dead within a few months of the enemy occupation of that island.

Although the enemy actually occupied only Ocean Island, Tarawa, Butaritari and Abemama, the activities of Japanese naval and air units effectually cut off all communication with the Gilbert Islands until November, 1943, when American forces, after heavy fighting at Tarawa, cleared the enemy from the group. Ocean Island remained in enemy hands until after the surrender of Japan and its reoccupation by Australian forces in October, 1945.

After their reoccupation in November, 1943, Tarawa and Butaritari were used as advanced bases for war operations against the enemy in the north-western Pacific. The Resident Commissioner and a number of other Government officers went in with the reoccupying forces to re-establish civil administration and for purposes of liaison between the American Command and the civil population. The whole of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands remained in military occupation and under military administration until after the surrender of Japan.

The Ellice Islands were not at any time under enemy occupation but were occupied by American forces during 1942, and advanced Military, Naval and Air bases were established at Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau. Patrolling enemy aircraft from the Gilbert Islands flew over frequently and made occasional bombing raids.

In the Phoenix Islands an American Military, Naval and Air base was established in Canton Island, which became of great importance on the transpacific air route for military aircraft. The island was shelled by an enemy submarine and subjected to occasional enemy air raids.

The Line Islands were free of enemy molestation during the war but were garrisoned by allied forces and under military administration.

Immediately upon the reoccupation of Ocean Island the British Phosphate Commissioners sent in men and material to commence the rehabilitation of the phosphate industry and re-commenced production during 1946.

The native population of Ocean Island, comprising some 900 Banabans and 1,200 Gilbertese, was deported by the Japanese during 1942 and 1943, some being sent to Nauru, some to the Caroline Islands and some to the Gilbert Islands, with the exception of some 150 able-bodied Gilbertese who were retained as labourers. These latter were brutally massacred by the Japanese in August, 1945, after the surrender of Japan.

The Banabans were collected in November and December, 1945, and, as their villages and means of sustenance in Ocean Island had been destroyed by the enemy, were transported to Rabi Island, in the Fiji group.

Since reoccupation the headquarters of the Colony Government has been temporarily at Tarawa. It is not proposed that colony headquarters should be re-established in Ocean Island, but that it should be permanently established in the Central Gilbert Islands atoll of Abemama.

**Population**

The population of the colony as determined by the 1931 census was as follows:—Ocean Island, 2,309; Gilbert Islands, 26,528; Ellice Islands, 4,074; Line Islands, 505. The total of 33,416 comprised 275 Europeans, 32,467 natives, 235 part Europeans and 439 Asiatics. A further census was taken in 1947 but the returns are not yet available.

**Administration**

The colony is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed at Tarawa) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific who resides in Fiji. There is no Legislative Council. The laws consist of local Ordinances made by the High Commissioner under powers conferred by the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893, together with such British Acts as are of general application.

The territory is divided into five administrative districts—the Gilbert Islands District, the Ellice Islands District, the Ocean Island District, the Phoenix Islands District and the Line Islands District. Each district is under the control of an Administrative Officer aided by Assistant Administrative Officers in the larger districts. Each island has its own native government, presided over by a Native Magistrate. A code of native laws is validated by a Colony Ordinance, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials.

**Religion**

The majority of natives are Christians, being adherents of the London Mission Society or the Sacred Heart Mission. The number of the adherents of the principal denominations in 1931 was as follows:

- London Missionary Society: 19,901
- Roman Catholic: 12,589
- Other Christian denominations: 181

There were 718 Confucians and 1,603 pagans at the time of the 1931 Census.

**Currency and Banking**

There are no banking facilities in the colony, business usually being transacted through banks in Fiji or the neighbouring Dominions. Plans are being made for the establishment of a Government Savings Bank.

Australian currency is legal tender.
Communications

Shipping communications with the outside world are irregular and the colony is dependent mainly on phosphate ships between Ocean Island to Australia and small supply vessels operated by the Government which pay infrequent visits to Fiji. Occasional overseas vessels call at colony ports to load copra. There are no commercial air services or railways in the colony. The postal rate for letters within the colony is 1d. per ounce. The rates to destinations beyond the colony are as follows:

To Great Britain and Northern Ireland, British Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, India, Egypt, the Sudan, British Indian Postal Agencies in French Settlements in India and in Tibet, New Hebrides, British Postal Agencies in Morocco, Tonga and Tristan da Cunha: first ounce, 2½d.; each succeeding ounce, 1½d.

To all other countries: first ounce, 3d; each succeeding ounce, 1½d.

A parcels post service operates to Australia and Fiji, the postage rate being 8½d. for the first lb. and 6½d. for every additional lb. up to 11 lbs. Parcels to other countries are charged the rate to Australia or Fiji plus the postage from the country concerned to the Country of destination.

Wireless telegraph stations are located on Tarawa, Ocean Island, Abemama, Beru, Butaritari, Nanumea, Nui, Nuiatua, Vaitupu, Funafuti, Niulakita, Canton, Hull, Sydney and Gardner Islands. Fanning Island is a station on the trans-Pacific cable operated by Cable & Wireless, Ltd.

Social Services

Medical

The Central Hospital for the colony is located at Tarawa and is supervised by the Senior Medical Officer. Hospitals are maintained on Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners and on Fanning Island by Cable & Wireless, Ltd., each with European Medical Officers. All other permanently inhabited islands have island hospitals under the charge of either Assistant Medical Practitioners trained at the Central Medical School at Suva or of native dressers trained at the Tarawa Hospital. Native nurses are trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Education

There are Government boarding schools for boys at Abemama and Vaitupu and a Government primary school for boys and girls at temporary Colony Headquarters at Tarawa but village education is mainly controlled by the Missions, assisted by Government grants. At present the more promising students are sent to Fiji for secondary education and training at the Central Medical School or the Teachers' Training College.

Labour

There is no Labour Department in the colony, the enforcement of the Labour Ordinances in each district being the responsibility of Administrative Officer.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate

Situation and Area

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is situated between the parallels of 5° S., and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° of E. longitude.

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands, extending at its extremities from Bougainville Straits to Mitre Island, in the Santa Cruz group, for a distance of 900 miles, and north and south from the Ontong Java group to Rennell Island for a distance of 430 miles, in an area approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,000 square miles are land.

Climate

The climate of the Solomon Islands, owing to the prevalence of malaria, is not healthy, but the conditions of living have been greatly improved during recent years and the possibilities of good health during temporary residence have been enormously increased.

Generally speaking, the seasons are well defined by the trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the lowest minimum temperature is recorded, and the highest mean and maximum temperatures are, as a rule, recorded in the months from November to April which is commonly known as the north-west season.
The rainfall varies considerably from month to month and year to year, though the average rainfall, recorded at Tulagi, is approximately 120 inches a year.

**HISTORY**

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in the year 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. The island first sighted they named Ysabel because it was on that Saint’s day that they left Callao. In the year 1595 a second expedition under Mendana sailed from Peru, but failed to locate the island of Guadalcanal, whereon it was intended he should form a settlement, and he arrived in the Santa Cruz group, and landed at Graciosa Bay. The new colony proved a failure, the death of Mendana put an end to any prospect of success, and the remnants of the original party returned to Peru.

In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the island of Malaita.

In the same year de Bougainville in the frigate *La Boudeuse*, sailed from Monte Video on a deliberate quest of the Terra Australis which he missed, and arrived at New Guinea; in sailing back he passed through the Straits which are the present north-eastern boundary of the Protectorate, the island on the right being named Bougainville after him, and the one on the left named after Choiseul, who was at the time Minister of France.

Twenty years later, and 700 miles to the south-east, la Perouse, in command of the French frigates *L’Astrolabe* and *La Boussole*, on a voyage of discovery, was wrecked at P’iou on the island of Vanikoro. His fate was unknown for 40 years.

From this time many Europeans visited the group, and British ships-of-war paid periodical visits.

In 1860 natives were recruited to work on plantations in Queensland and Fiji. The recruiting for Queensland ceased in 1903 and most of the natives were repatriated.

Recruiting for Fiji continued until 1910.

Between the years 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the Southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristoval, the New Georgia Group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50.

In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tucopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona, were added to the protectorate, and in 1900 the northern islands, namely, Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits, south and south-east of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ontong Java, were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

Early in 1942 Japanese aircraft commenced bombing raids on the protectorate capital at Tulagi, and when enemy invasion became imminent in February and March the majority of the non-native population, including all Government officials who could be spared, were evacuated to Australia. The Resident Commissioner and a number of officers remained in the protectorate to continue the administration so far as possible, but evacuated Tulagi and other stations on the seashore and moved to various places in the interior of the larger islands. The Resident Commissioner, with a wireless officer equipped with a portable radio, moved to Malaita, whence he maintained communication with his officers and radio communication with Suva and other stations, collecting and passing out invaluable intelligence reports of enemy movements and activities until the landing of American forces later in the year.

During the early months of 1942 the enemy overran and occupied the western half of the protectorate as far as Guadalcanal, Nggela and Ysabel, and established a post on the north-western end of Malaita. In Guadalcanal the Japanese immediately commenced the construction of an airfield with the obvious intention of using it as an advanced base for the bombing of areas to the south and west.

In August, 1942, the American Marine Division landed in Tulagi and Guadalcanal, occupied the Japanese airfield (later developed into the Henderson airfield) and, after some months of stiff fighting, drove the enemy out of the central portion of the protectorate. On the arrival of the American forces the Resident Commissioner established contact with the commander and the administration thereafter operated as a military administration under the control of the military commander.

During 1943 the enemy was dislodged from the western end of the protectorate, with the exception of the small Shortland group and the north-western tip of the large island of Choiseul which remained in enemy hands until the surrender of Japan.

The economy of the protectorate is based almost wholly on the copra industry and the greater part of the copra exported before the war was produced on coconut plantations owned and operated by Europeans. On the retirement early in 1942 of the non-native population before the Japanese invasion the plantations were necessarily abandoned, and, with the rapid tropical growth of underbrush during four years of neglect, have deteriorated greatly; and this, combined with the severe damage caused by war operations, has reduced the potential of copra production by at least 50 percent since 1941, when it stood at about 24,000 tons per annum. Due to the scarcity of shipping after the war, it has not been possible to resume a direct shipping link with the Australian markets. As a result it is extremely difficult to import supplies and consequently very few European planters have been able to return to their plantations and resume copra production.

The Protectorate relies almost entirely upon a small vessel of 288 tons for overseas shipping communications, and the vessel is owned and operated by the Government.

Apart from the Allied forces engaged in local war operations, large bases were established in the protectorate for operations further afield; and consequently very large Allied forces were in occupation or temporarily quartered in the group. The effect upon the native population of contact with such large numbers of Allied servicemen was necessarily great and far-reaching and a certain disruption of native life and change in outlook was inevitable. It is yet too early to say to what extent these effects will have made a permanent impression upon the natives; but they are being felt in many directions and are likely to have an important bearing on the resumption of the normal economic life of the protectorate.
An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory has been the great loyalty of the native people to their British connection and to the Allied cause generally.

**POPULATION**

The estimated population in June, 1947, exclusive of members of the American forces stationed in the protectorate, are:

- Europeans: 118
- Melanesians: 90,930
- Polynesians: 3,808
- Chinese: 109

Total: 94,965

*Census, 1931:*

Aliens and Resident

Whites: 497
Coloured: 90,719
Strangers not included in previous column: 193

**ADMINISTRATION**

The British Solomon Islands protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed at Honiara in Guadalcanal) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific (who resides in Suva, Fiji).

There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of King’s Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order-in-Council, 1893.

There is an Advisory Council, consisting of the Resident Commissioner and not more than seven members, three of whom may be officials.

**CUSTOMS AND TRADE**

The Customs tariff consists of duties at specific or *ad valorem* rates and includes provision for Empire preferences. During the reconstructional stage through which the protectorate is passing, it has not been possible to extract accurate details of trade, but it is estimated that during 1946 the proportion of trading with various markets was as follows:

- United Kingdom: 30 per cent.
- Other parts of the British Empire: 67 per cent.
- Foreign markets: 3 per cent.

**TONGA**

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, area about 250 square miles, situated between 18° and 22° south latitude, were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most are of coral formation, but some are volcanic. The Tongans are Polynesians, closely allied to the Maoris and Samoans. The islands are in three main groups, Vava’u, Ha’apai, and Tongatapu (containing the capital, Nuku’alofo). In the late 18th and early 19th centuries...
there was fierce civil war between the three groups, and not until 1845 did King George Tupou succeed in uniting the whole of Tonga. The centenary of the unified kingdom was celebrated on 4th December, 1945.

King George Tupou I, who died in 1893, was succeeded by his great-grandson George Tupou II, on whose death in 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter, succeeded. The Queen, who was born in 1900, married the late Prince Uliami Tungi, who died in 1941.

Queen Salote Tupou was made an Honorary G.B.E. on the occasion of the centenary in 1945. Her heir is her elder son, Tungi, B.A., LL.B. (Sydney), who was born in 1919.

**Climate**

The climate is healthy. Although hot and humid from January to March, it is pleasantly cool during most of the remaining months. The temperature ranges from $53^\circ$ to $93^\circ$ F. The average annual rainfall varies between 70 inches in Tongatapu and 110 in Vava'u.

**History**

Much of the history of Tonga since the year 1826, when the first Wesleyan missionaries landed in Tonga, has been concerned with the relationship between Church and State. By the middle of the century practically all the chiefs and people had embraced Christianity, the great majority being Wesleyans. The control and management of the Wesleyan Mission remained with the Australasian Conference until 1885, when King George Tupou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded. Assisted by the Rev. Shirley Baker, originally a Wesleyan missionary, then also Premier, the King established the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga as an independent body. In 1887 an attempt by some escaped native convicts on the Premier's life was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaoogs" or members of the original Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100 were deported to Fiji. At an enquiry by the High Commissioner the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakagoog" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the King, was addressed to the High Commissioner, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the mission church at once recommenced.

In 1890 further complaints were made; and Tongan officials denied that the King had promised to accord freedom of worship. Finding, after further inquiry, that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the trouble, Sir John Thurston prohibited him from being within the group for a term of two years. A few days earlier the King, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh government was formed with a Tongan Premier, Tukuaho. Under the new government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled.

In 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church and, after an enquiry into the state of the finances, it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies. At a joint conference union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. B. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued in respect of the ownership of the property of the church established by King George Tupou I, which was finally decided in favour of the United Church, now known as the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, of which the present Queen is the head.

**Constitution**

The present constitution was granted in 1875, although it has since been amended. It provides for a Government consisting of the Sovereign, a Privy Council and Cabinet, a Legislative Assembly and the Judiciary.

The Sovereign presides over the Privy Council, which consists of the Premier, the Ministers (at present three Tongans and one European, who are also heads of government departments), and the Governors of Vava'u and Ha'apai when they are at headquarters. The constitution of the Cabinet is similar, except that the Premier and not the Sovereign presides. The Legislative Assembly consists of the Premier and Ministers of the Crown (including the two Governors), seven representatives of the nobles elected by the nobles themselves, and seven representatives of the people elected by popular franchise, every male Tongan of 21 years of age who pays taxes and can read and write being qualified to vote. Elections for both the nobles and the representatives of the people are held every three years. The President of the Legislative Assembly is the Speaker, appointed by the Sovereign. The courts consists of a Supreme Court, a magistrate's court and a land court. British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or imprisonment for over two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the court of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific.

Tonga is a self-governing protectorate under the protection of Great Britain, established by a Treaty of Friendship and Protection signed in 1900.

**Population**

The following are the official estimates of population as at 31st December, 1946:

| Category                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Tongans                   | 42,050     |
| Europeans                 | 200        |
| Persons of mixed descent  | 550        |
| Other Pacific Islanders   | 300        |
| Others                    | 90         |
| **Total**                 | **43,190** |

A census will be held in 1948.

**Religion**

There are seven missions in Tonga:—The Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, about 20,700 adherents; Free Church of Tonga and Church of Tonga (off-shoots of the Wesleyan Church), about 11,250; Roman Catholics, 5,900; Church of England, 270; Church of Latter Day Saints, 2,060; Seventh-Day Adventists, 330.

**Currency and Banking**

There has been a Government note issue since 1919, denominations being £5, £1, 10s. and 4s. The amount of notes in circulation on 30th June, 1946, was £85,690. Tongan currency is at present at a discount of 25 per cent. on sterling. United Kingdom, Australian, New Zealand and Fiji silver and copper coinage are legal tender.
There are no private banks in the kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1946 there were some 3,327 depositors and £113,335 in deposits.

**Communications**

There is a monthly steamship service from New Zealand via Fiji, and vessels call at regular intervals to load copra for the United Kingdom.

There are about 200 miles of roads in the group, but a proportion of this mileage consists of earth roads which are only usable by motor traffic in dry weather.

There is a first-class aerodrome on the island of Tongatapu, large enough to take the largest aircraft, and limited seaplane facilities at Nuku'alofa and Vavau harbours.

There are five wireless stations in the group and a telephone service in Nuku'alofa.

**Social Services**

There are both Government and Mission primary schools, primary education in Tonga being compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years. There are one Government and four Mission colleges for boys, at each of which provision is made for secondary education. The secondary education of girls is in the hands of the missions. The Tongans are entirely literate.

There are three public hospitals, the main one being at Nuku'alofa, where the Chief Medical Officer is in charge. There are 15 Tongan medical practitioners, trained at the Central Medical School in Fiji, stationed at various islands throughout the group.

Every male Tongan on reaching the taxable age of 16 years is entitled to 8½ acres of land for cultivation in addition to a small village allotment for his dwelling. For these two allotments he pays a tax of 8s. a year. He pays also an annual tax of 32s. for which free education, medical, hospital and dental treatment are provided.

**Finance and Trade**

| Year    | Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1937–38 | 69,241  | 62,742      |
| 1938–39 | 60,441  | 69,612      |
| 1942–43 | 116,180 | 99,375      |

| 1946–47 | 116,870 | 113,060     |

The chief exports are copra and bananas, the average annual export of copra being about 12,000 tons and of bananas about 80,000 cases. All copra is now shipped to the United Kingdom, the bananas to New Zealand.

There is no public debt, and the amount of accumulated balances on 31st December, 1946, was £252,099.

The main source of revenue is customs duties. In addition to a number of specific duties there is a general tariff of 3¾ per cent. *ad valorem* and a British preferential tariff of 15 per cent. *ad valorem*. There is also a Port and Customs Service tax on imports of 5 per cent.

**The New Hebrides**

**Situation and Area**

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 13th and 21st degrees of south latitude and the 166th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 square miles.

**Climate**

The rather enervating climate is generally classed as unhealthy owing to the prevalence of malaria, but conditions of living, particularly in the town of Vila, have improved greatly in recent years.

The year is divided into two fairly distinct seasons, the hot and wet season during which cyclones are experienced from November to April and the dry and cool season of the south-east trade winds from May to October. Temperatures at Vila range from a minimum of 56°F. to 94°F. Average annual rainfall ranges from about 50 inches in the south to about 160 inches in the north with an average of 74 inches in the town of Vila.

**General Description**

The New Hebrides islands are generally of coral with some volcanic formation. They are almost without exception mountainous, but most have narrow cultivable coastal strips. The highest peak is on the island of Santo and rises to over 6,000 feet. The growth of vegetation is very heavy and the soil is particularly suitable for the cultivation of tropical crops, the principal of which are coco-nuts, cocoa and coffee. The export of kauri logs has been developed since 1941 from Aneityum, the southernmost island of the group. No secondary industries exist.

**History**

The new Hebrides group was discovered by the Spanish explorer de Quiros in 1606. The next mention came from the French navigator Bougainville in 1768 and later in 1774 Captain Cook visited and charted the greater part of the chain of islands comprising the New Hebrides. Other early visitors were Laperouse who supposedly visited the group in 1788 and D'Entrecasteaux who came in search of Laperouse in 1793. In this last year the sighting of the Banks Islands was recorded by Captain Bligh during his open boat voyage to Timor after the mutiny of the Bounty. Dumont d'Urville, Belcher and Markham also left records of early visits to the New Hebrides.
CONSTITUTION

Before any national eyes were turned on the New Hebrides a number of British and French missionaries, planters and traders had established themselves throughout the New Hebrides, and in 1887, by the Anglo-French Convention of 16th November, each nation agreed not to exercise separate control over the group and appointed a Joint Naval Commission, consisting of the captains and two officers from visiting warships charged with the protection in the New Hebrides of the lives and property of the subjects of the two nations—France and England. In 1895 the British and French colonists established an Arbitration Court, to deal principally with land disputes, but this was later dissolved on the veto of the Joint Naval Commission. In 1902 Deputy Resident Commissioners were appointed and took up residence in the territory.

In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on 20th October, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on 2nd December, 1907. Its provisions included the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert.

A Protocol, drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on 18th March, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

POPULATION

A partly estimated census in 1946 placed at 45,000 the native population which is Melanesian with an admixture of Polynesian blood in certain parts of the group. Non-native population in December, 1946, was as follows:

| European— | |
|---|---|
| British Nationals and Resortissants | 245 |
| French Citizens and Resortissants | 674 |

| Asiatic | |
|---|---|
| .. | .. |
| .. | 2,995 |

Total | .. | 3,914

Of the Asiatic population 2,917 comprised Tonkinese labourers and their families who had been introduced as indentured labour until 1940. The first repatriation of these commenced in January, 1947. The remainder of the Asiatic population comprises principally Chinese storekeepers and market gardeners.

ADMINISTRATION

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of national officers, have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium staff working in departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners. There are a British and a French National Administrative Officer stationed in each Administrative District as the District Agents of the Resident Commissioners.

RELIGION

Missionary endeavour commenced with the arrival and massacre of Messrs. Williams and Harris of the London Missionary Society in 1839. Commencing in 1842, frequent and persistent attempts were made by various mission bodies for the christianising of the natives of the New Hebrides and half a century later established mission stations existed in various parts. The mission bodies at present carrying on work in the New Hebrides are those of the Presbyterian Church sponsored from different parts of the British Empire, the Melanesian Missionary Society, the Seventh Day Adventists, the Church of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

English sterling and French currency are both legal tender in the New Hebrides. Australian currency is officially recognised in substitution for sterling at current exchange rates. Since 1940 bank notes of the Bank of Indo China, Noumea, overprinted "New Hebrides," and New Hebridean "bons du Tresor" have replaced the notes of the Bank of Indo China, formerly accepted part passu with those of the Bank of France. There are no banks in the New Hebrides.

COMMUNICATIONS

There are no railways or tramways. Shipping services are maintained with Sydney, Australia, Noumea, New Caledonia, and Marseilles, via the Panama Canal. In 1947 spasmodic air services, later possibly to become regular, were opened by private endeavour, an Australian company flying from Sydney to the New Hebrides and a New Caledonian company from Noumea. Postal communications are via Noumea and Australia by the shipping and air services mentioned. Telegraphic communication is by direct wireless contact with Suva, Fiji, Noumea, New Caledonia, and Sydney, Australia.

SOCIAL SERVICES

French Government hospitals and medical aid posts are established at different points and staffed by French National Medical Officers. Supported and subsidised by H.M. Government, hospitals and medical aid posts have been established by some of the British mission bodies on several of the islands. British and French National Medical Officers comprise a Condominium medical service providing quarantine facilities, medical inspection of plantation and other labour and medical assistance to the native population. This joint service is reinforced by New Hebridean Assistant Medical Practitioners trained at the Central Medical School, Suva.

The French Government has established a primary school at Vila and the French Roman Catholic Mission has schools at Vila and Santo. H.M. Government subsidises a co-operative English primary school and a Presbyterian Mission primary school for natives at Vila. Village schools for natives are conducted by two mission bodies in the vicinity of their stations throughout the Group.

Inspection of indentured and other labour is carried out by the District Agents.

Fuller details are to be found in the Annual Report of the New Hebrides.

(Fuller details are to be found in the Condominium Official Gazette.)

The customs tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an *ad valorem* basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

In 1944 of the import trade 88 per cent. was claimed by Australia and 11 per cent. by the U.S.A. The remaining 1 per cent. of imports came from New Caledonia and the United Kingdom. Since then, with the cessation of hostilities and the re-opening of shipping lines their former share of the import trade is tending to return to Britain and France.

Since 1946 all copra production has gone to France under allocation of the International Emergency Food Council and cocoa to Australia. Coffee production, which has fallen off in recent years through shortage of labour, has gone principally to Australia, France, Martinique and Guadaloupe.

**The World War, 1939-45**

Repercussions were felt in the New Hebrides early in the European war with the loss of its principal export market, France, but these effects were greatly offset by the absorption by Australia of the cocoa and coffee crops and such proportion of the copra production for which occasional shipping became available. Later, the New Hebrides copra production was allocated to the U.S.A. whence it continued to be exported within shipping limitations until the re-opening of the French market.

In December, 1941, the New Hebrides Defence Force was formed and trained locally by a detachment of the Australian Imperial Forces under arrangements made with the Commonwealth Government. Officers and N.C.O.s of the local force were recruited from among British and French Nationals resident in the territory and other ranks from among New Hebridean natives. The New Hebrides Defence Force did not see active service but carried out observation post duties in the extreme northern parts of the Group.

In March, 1942, units of the U.S. Forces commenced the establishment of forward bases in the New Hebrides which in the ensuing years, were used to a very considerable extent as staging and training bases by the Allied Forces during the prosecution of the campaign against the Japanese.

From August, 1942, until March, 1943, the Japanese carried out spasmodic nuisance bombing raids on the island of Santo, employing flying boats based in the Solomon Islands. The raiding parties, comprising never more than three aircraft, always operated at night and on no occasion caused any material damage.

The direct effects of the war on the New Hebrides were, therefore, confined to interruption of shipping services with consequent disruption of production, the latter being aggravated by the depletion of the supply of native and Asiatic labourers available through their employment on military construction work, whilst the indirect effect on the native population of prolonged contact with overwhelmingly large numbers of personnel of the Allied Forces was very considerable, in so far as it affected their general outlook, ways of living, and sense of economic values, though these effects are gradually becoming less apparent with the passage of time since the final departure of all Allied Forces from the Group.

**Pitcairn Island**

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (latitude 25° 3' S., longitude 130° 8' W.). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. *Bounty*, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population (at 30th June, 1936) numbered 202 persons.

It is a British colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the West Pacific in 1898 under section 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

Chief Magistrate—Norris Young.

The Government is now administered under the High Commissioner, by a Council consisting of a chief magistrate, two assessors, a secretary and a chairman of the internal committee. These officers are elected annually by the people.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
