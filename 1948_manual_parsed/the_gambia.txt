THE GAMBIA

Situation and Area

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but narrowing to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary’s Island. There are 26 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 13 feet can at present proceed without trouble to MacCarthy Island. There is no bar to the Gambia River.

The seat of government is Bathurst, 13° 27’ N., 16° 34’ W. long., situated on St. Mary’s Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony consists of the island of St. Mary, British Kombo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, the territories of Brefet and Bajana, and MacCarthy Island, situated between the falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and 158 miles distant from the latter. MacCarthy Island forms a line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the Upper River and Lower River. The total area of the Colony is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey).

The Protectorate extends on both banks of the river for 250 miles from its mouth, and its area, including that of the parts of the Colony administered as Protectorate, is 3,964 square miles. The island of St. Mary has an area of about 2,500 acres. A survey of the boundaries dividing the Gambia from the Senegal was completed by the Anglo-French Boundary Commission in 1905.

Climate

The climate of the Gambia during the dry season from the middle of November to the middle of May is pleasant and generally healthy. During the wet season from June to October the conditions are much the same as elsewhere on the
West Coast of Africa. The wettest month is August, and the most unpleasant month, owing to the humidity, is October. In the interior, the temperature varies between $60^\circ$ and $110^\circ$ and in Bathurst between $60^\circ$ and $100^\circ$.

The rainfall is extremely variable from year to year, ranging between 30 and 50 inches.

**HISTORY**

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators but they made no settlement.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in London and Exeter to trade with the Gambia. This company did not prosper. Its voyages were not slave trading ventures but were made for legitimate commerce. In 1618, King James I of England granted a charter to Sir Robert Rich and other London merchants. Their enterprise was entitled "The Company of Adventurers of London trading in Africa," and Fort James was built by them on a small island 17 miles above the island of Banjola (now St. Mary's).

About the year 1631 another British chartered company was formed, King Charles I having granted a charter to Sir B. Young, Sir R. Digby and others. This venture was responsible for supplying British settlements in the West Indies with slaves for working on the estates.

In 1662 King Charles II granted a charter to a third company known as "The Royal Adventurers of England trading in Africa." A few years later this company exhausted its capital and surrendered its charter. In 1672 a fourth company was incorporated under the name of "The Royal African Company," and it was not until 1752, after having in its early days reached the highest point of commercial prosperity which had been touched by England in Africa, that it was superseded by "The Company of Merchants." The right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles, 1783, which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. The year 1807 saw the abolition of the slave trade, and though "The Company of Merchants" lingered on with an annual subsidy, the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off till 1816, in which year a new settlement was formed on the island of Banjola by the English merchants who resided at Goree and in Senegal until those places were given up to the French by the Treaty of Paris (1814). The island was renamed St. Mary's and the town, which was laid out, took its name from Lord Bathurst, Secretary of State at that time. The streets to be inhabited first were named after Lord Wellington and his generals at Waterloo.

The settlement was subject to the government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a military commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court," administered the government. From 1822 to 1829 the commandant governed alone.

In December, 1829, the Secretary of State appointed Lieutenant Colonel Alex. Findlay, R.A.C. Corps, as Lieutenant Governor (the first) of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia." The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force, but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

The Gambia, in the year 1843, was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. Captain H. P. Seagram, R.N., was the first Governor of the colony.

By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West African Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823 and named after Major-General Sir Charles MacCarthy, K.C.B., Governor-in-Chief of the British West African possessions; the ceded mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and the British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various sessions in 1840, 1850 and 1855.

In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection.

Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894, and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned, until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. There is a Commissioner in charge of each Division and each District is under a head chief.

**CONSTITUTION**

Under the Royal Instructions dated 29th November, 1946, and 26th November, 1947, the Executive Council of the colony consists of the Colonial Secretary as an ex officio member and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed; at the present time the appointed members include four officials and three African unofficials. The Governor is the President of the Council, and he may on any special occasion when he desires the opinion of any person within the colony summon such person as an extraordinary member. This provision precludes the possibility of a person resident within the Protectorate being summoned as an extraordinary member.

Under the Gambia (Legislative Council) Order in Council dated 29th November, 1946, as amended by a further Order in Council dated 26th November, 1947, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor as President, three ex officio members (the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Receiver-General), such number of nominated official and unofficial members as may from time to time be appointed and one elected member representing the town of Bathurst and the Kombo St. Mary Division. At least one of the nominated unofficial members must be appointed to represent the Protectorate. The present composition of the Legislative Council includes six nominated unofficial members and three nominated official members. There is, thus, an unofficial majority on the Council.
Under the Gambia Protectorate Order in Council dated 29th November, 1946, made under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act of 1890, it is provided that the Executive Council for the Colony shall also be the Executive Council of the Protectorate.

The Supreme Court of the Colony normally sits at Bathurst, but may sit in any part of the Colony. The High Court of the Protectorate exercises in the Protectorate the same jurisdiction as the Supreme Court exercises in the Colony. There is provision for trial by jury in the Colony, but provision is also made whereby the judge may sit with assessors in lieu of a jury. There is no provision for trial by jury in the Protectorate. The Colonial Magistrate exercises a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction in the Colony, and ranks as a first-class magistrate throughout the Protectorate. In the Protectorate, there is a Protectorate Court in every Division, the Commissioner in charge of the Division being a magistrate with first-class powers; provision is made whereby other suitable persons may be appointed magistrates with either first or second-class powers in the Protectorate. In Bathurst there is also the Mohammedan court presided over by the Cadi, which has jurisdiction to try cases, contentious or uncontentious, between or exclusively affecting Mohammedan natives, relating to civil status, marriage, succession, donations, testaments and guardianship.

In addition to these Courts there are throughout the Protectorate Native Tribunals established by warrant under the Native Tribunals Ordinance, 1933. These tribunals are of two grades, one having a greater jurisdiction than the other, but they correspond generally to the native courts or tribunals found in other colonies and protectorates. The Commissioner exercises a general power of revision, amounting in effect to appeal, over proceedings in Native Tribunals.

In all cases before all classes of Courts, local ideas and customs are taken into consideration whenever they are relevant to the issues.

**LAND**

The law relating to the tenure and management of lands in the Colony and Protectorate is contained in two ordinances enacted in 1945, the Colony Lands Ordinance and the Protectorate Lands Ordinance. The first is in effect a consolidating ordinance, and codifies the law as it has been for a long time.

There is a considerable amount of freehold land in the Colony: in addition there are a number of Crown leases, and the remainder of the land is occupied by the Crown. Generally, Crown leases are not granted for a greater period than 21 years in the first instance, and there is provision for revision of rent.

Prior to the enactment of the Protectorate Lands Ordinance, the Governor exercised over land in the Protectorate the same powers of disposition and management as he exercises over land in the Colony. The Protectorate Lands Ordinance, however, vests all Protectorate lands in the Native Authorities, to be held and administered for the common benefit, direct or indirect, of the communities concerned. The ordinance makes strict provisions for the occupation of land by non-indigenes: no non-indigenes may acquire a greater interest than a lease for 21 years in the first instance, and provision is made for rent revision. No Protectorate land may in any circumstances whatsoever be permanently alienated, not even to the Gambia Government. All revenues derived from lands in the Protectorate form part of the revenue of the Native Authorities concerned; all leases held from the Crown at the time of the coming into operation of the ordinance were automatically transferred to the appropriate Native Authorities as lessors.

**POPULATION**

Figures for Bathurst are:

| Year | Population |
|------|------------|
| 1911 | 7,700      |
| 1921 | 9,227      |
| 1931 | 14,370     |
| 1944 | 21,152     |

The large increase in 1944 may be attributed to the works undertaken by the services during the war years and the consequent influx of labour.

The figures for the Protectorate, from the assessment for tax purposes taken by Commissioners in 1946, were 219,983.

These figures are made up mainly from the following races:

- Mandingo: 99,200
- Wolof: 32,000
- Fula: 35,000
- Jola: 20,600
- Serahuli: 15,000
- Tukulor (branch of Fula tribe): 15,000

The Mandingo derive their names from Manding, a town some 700 miles inland and towards the north-east boundary of Sierra Leone. They are almost entirely Mohammedans.

The Wollofs form the largest part of the population of Bathurst. Outside Bathurst they are found mainly on the north bank of the river.

The Fulbe, more commonly known as Fula, are the main breeders of cattle and are found chiefly in the Upper River Division. Their features are somewhat of the Arabic type and their skins are of a lighter colour than negroes. The Fulbe are sub-divided into nine sub-tribes, Fulbe Firdu, Jombo, Lorobo, Habobo, Hamanabi Torodo, Jawando, Labo, Fulbe Futo, which fall into three linguistic divisions.

The Jolas came from Foni between the southern limit of Kombo and the north bank of the Casamance River. Their country runs in a northeasterly direction towards the south bank of the Gambia River as far as the mouth of the Bintang Creek. They were originally pagans but an increasing number are becoming Mohammedans.

The Serahulis are the most recent arrivals in the Gambia, having migrated from the interior of Senegal in the 19th century. They are found mainly in the extreme east of the Protectorate and are all Mohammedans.

The social organisation of the above-mentioned tribes is in the main based on the patrilineal Kin group, segments of which are commonly scattered among a number of sometimes quite distant villages.

**ADMINISTRATION**

(a) Colony

Certain portions of Colony land are administered under the Protectorate Ordinance, the only portion with a separate Colony administration being the island of St. Mary, on which Bathurst is situated, and Kombo St. Mary, the adjoining district on the mainland. The town of Bathurst is administered by a town council and the district of Kombo St. Mary by the Kombo Rural Authority. The Commissioner of the Colony is chairman of both bodies. The Town Council,
which has a revenue of some £12,000 a year, consists of four nominated members, other than the Chairman, and 15 members elected on a wide franchise. Members of the Rural Authority are at present all nominated and number 24, of whom four are government officers, in addition to the Chairman. Its revenue for 1947 is estimated at £1,700.

(b) Protectorate

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the protectorate by the Anglo-French Commission in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the protectorate into closer relationship with the Government of the Gambia.

The Protectorate Ordinance, 1935, empowers the Governor to divide the Protectorate into administrative Divisions, Districts and Sub-Districts, and to alter or vary the boundaries of such areas and to approve the appointment of a head chief, deputy head chief or sub-chief and to remove or suspend them from office. A head chief or sub-chief may appoint or remove headmen. There are at present four Divisions each in charge of a Commissioner. These are Western (area, 1,093 square miles, 12 Districts with a population of 55,266); Central (area, 1,122 square miles, 11 Districts with a population of 64,570); MacCarthy Island (area, 959 square miles; eight Districts with population of 47,866); Upper River (area 790 square miles; four Districts with population of 48,331). In addition to a total population estimated at 219,983, approximately 20,000 farmers from the adjoining French territory immigrate for the ground-nut farming season.

The Native Authority Ordinance, 1933, provides for the appointment of a chief or native council or group of natives as a Native Authority. The membership of the 36 Native Authorities consists in all cases of district heads as presidents, together with their village heads and advisers in council. Since 1944 there has been an annual conference of the Protectorate chiefs which may be the forerunner of a Protectorate Council. At these conferences matters relating to the Protectorate are explained to the chiefs, and there is free discussion of any topic of interest.

The Protectorate Treasuries Ordinance, 1945, permits the formation of group or district treasuries managed by finance committees appointed by the native authorities.

The Senior Commissioner exercises a general supervision of the work of the commissioners and performs the functions exercised elsewhere by a Secretary of Native Affairs.

RELIGION

The people of the Colony and Protectorate are predominantly Mohammedan though in the Protectorate there are several pagan enclaves consisting mostly of Jolas and Fulas. The Christians are almost entirely confined to Bathurst where, according to the 1944 census of Bathurst, there are approximately 5,000 Christians out of a population of 21,000. These Christians are composed of Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Methodists, and a mission for each of these denominations has its headquarters in the town.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The currency is British West African silver, alloy and nickel-bronze coins and British West African currency notes for 20s. and 10s. Coins that are legal tender in the United Kingdom under the Coinage Acts of 1870 and 1891 are also legal tender in the Gambia. There is one bank in Bathurst, the Bank of British West Africa, Ltd.

A Government Savings Bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st December, 1946, £11,659 deposited by 5,977 persons.

COMMUNICATIONS

Services between the United Kingdom and the Gambia are maintained by Messrs. Elder-Dempster Lines, Ltd., the United Africa Company, Ltd., and John Holt & Company, Ltd.

The West African Airways Corporation provides a service which connects at Dakar with the trunk route between the United Kingdom and South America. Aircraft landing at Bathurst use the airfield at Yundum.

Bathurst has a first-class flying-boat base which was for long used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation transatlantic Boeing services but which is now out of use.

Internal communication is conducted chiefly by water-borne craft, the Gambia River forming an unrivalled highway for 300 miles. The Government maintains a service of river steamers which normally run weekly during the trading season and fortnightly or monthly at other times of the year.

Cable and Wireless, Limited, own and operate the cable station at Bathurst, whence submarine cables connect the Colony with West Africa and countries all over the world.

Bathurst wireless station, which has a range of approximately 1,000 miles, communicates with ships at sea and the important town of Dakar in the French Senegal. Wireless stations are also established at Kunta-ur, Georgetown and Basse, and a regular service is maintained between these inland towns and Bathurst.

A central battery telephone system is employed in the town of Bathurst, and in direct connection with Cape St. Mary. A telephone line between Kunta-ur, Georgetown and Bansang is under construction.

There are no railways. A laterite metalled road connects Bathurst with Cape St. Mary and Fajara on the coast about 10 miles from Bathurst, crossing Oyster Creek at Denton Bridge. At Mile Six a similar road leads by Kanifin to Brikama, 16½ miles. Another road goes from Kanifin to Sukuta, 3½ miles. The remainder of the road system consists of a secondary road on each bank of the river to Basse, with feeder roads to various wharf towns on the river. These secondary roads are usable in the dry season only.

Motor cars are used in Bathurst and its vicinity throughout the year and in parts of the Protectorate during the dry season.

There is no direct parcel post scheme at present with foreign countries. All parcels are forwarded through the medium of the General Post Office, London, a small additional charge being made for onward transmission.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Medical and Health

Medical facilities in the Gambia are based on two general hospitals, one at Bathurst and one at Bansang. Supplementing these are health centres at Basse and Bakau, a mobile unit which undertakes a regular weekly circuit in part of the Western Division, and 21 dispensaries and sub-dispensaries situated throughout the Protectorate. Maternity and infant welfare work remains chiefly centred in Bathurst, but ante-natal and
infant welfare clinics are in operation at Bakau, Sukuta and Brikama in Kombo North and South Bank divisions, at Basse and to a lesser extent at Georgetown in conjunction with Bansang hospital. All such centres are now supervised by a welfare Sister, those at Basu and Georgetown being visited by a Sister from Bansang.

The health service also is chiefly centred in Bathurst, with African inspectors posted to various important points in the Protectorate.

The staffs of both services have been considerably augmented and are now in training as part of the major development schemes projected.

**Education**

There is an Education Department under the Senior Education Officer who has the assistance of a Lady Education Officer. An Education Officer for the Protectorate was appointed in 1946.

In Bathurst all primary schools were reorganised during 1945 and became Government schools, and all teachers therein became Government teachers. The schools, which had previously been co-educational, are now divided into boys' and girls' primary schools, and infants are separated and housed in three new infants' schools.

The reorganised schools are divided into three groups: Anglican-Methodist boys' primary, girls' primary and infant schools; Roman Catholic boys' primary, girls' primary and infant schools; Mohammedan boys' primary, which admits a few girls and infants. A primary schools management committee functions in an advisory capacity, while the actual management of each group of schools is in the hands of a sub-committee on which the particular religious authority concerned has a 50 per cent. representation. The total number of scholars on the roll of these schools at the end of 1946 was 1,932.

The reorganisation scheme for primary schools in Bathurst has been made possible by a grant from Colonial Development and Welfare Act funds, and direct Government expenditure on primary and secondary education in the town now amounts to approximately £15,162 annually.

In Bathurst also there are four secondary schools, two Methodist high schools, one for boys and one for girls, and two Roman Catholic secondary schools, one for boys and one for girls. Classes from all the secondary schools attend a central joint science school. The total number of pupils in these schools at the end of 1946 was 498. The control of these schools is still in the hands of the missions concerned but Government has now assumed responsibility for payment of European and African staffs under agreed conditions.

In the Protectorate there is a Government boarding school at Georgetown in MacCarthy Island which draws pupils from the various Divisions. In this school, which had previously only given elementary education, middle classes are gradually being added, two such being added in 1946. These and a vocational class, which was added in the same year, will train Protectorate boys for posts in the newly organised Native Administrations. The total number of pupils on the roll at the end of 1946 was 132. Apart from the above school the only other schools in the Protectorate so far are mission schools. The Roman Catholic mission has two elementary schools, one assisted and one unassisted, in Upper River Division, totalling 50 pupils approximately, and one unassisted school in the MacCarthy Island Division. The Anglican mission runs, in the Upper River Division, two small unassisted elementary schools and one unassisted school for boys of various standards who have emigrated from Bathurst. Government is planning the progressive institution of local administration schools in the various Divisions, two such being started in 1946 with 72 pupils on their rolls.

**Labour**

The Labour Department was created in 1939 and provision is made in its establishment for the appointment of a substantive Labour Officer. One was appointed during 1946.

The employment offered in the Gambia is largely of a casual nature, particularly during the groundnut trade season when Protectorate farmers migrate to Bathurst in search of work. This type of labour does not lend itself to Trade Unionism and the main function of the Labour Dept. in its present stage is in hearing and dealing with individual complaints. Improvements are, however, being made and the amalgamation of the existing Trade Unions has increased their membership. Claims under the Workmen's Compensation legislation are usually taken up by the Labour Officer on behalf of illiterates, and he also advises on and implements the various labour ordinances in force. In addition, the Department acts as a Labour Exchange.
