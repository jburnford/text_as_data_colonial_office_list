BERMUDA

SITUATION AND AREA

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group of about 300 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean in latitude 32° 15' N. and longitude 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730 miles, from New York 677 miles and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles.

The total area is estimated at about 21 square miles as compared with 19 square miles prior to the establishment of naval and military bases by the Government of the United States. Between 1941 and 1943 certain islands were joined and other areas, previously water covered, were filled in and now form a part of the territory occupied by the United States bases, including a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

CLIMATE

The climate has long been celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The mean monthly temperature in 1946 was 71° 2°F., the minimum recorded being 48° 2°F in March and the maximum 89° 3°F in August. The mean relative humidity was 76, the most humid month being July when it reached 82. The rainfall in 1946 was 59-26 inches and was fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The summer heat is usually tempered by a pleasant sea breeze.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Bermudas, of which a good account will be found in the narrative of the voyage of the Challenger, may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sandhills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 3 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. The largest island, generally known as the main island, is about 14 miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands and areas reclaimed for the United States bases aggregate about 4,280 acres. The City of Hamilton, now the seat of government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the vessels which carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of government to Hamilton...
is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, entirely given up for the accommodation of His Majesty's dockyard and a number of other naval establishments; Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, and now exclusively occupied by military depôts and garrisons; Somerset, Smith's, Nonsuch, Ports and Godets—all inhabited by a civil population.

A part of St. David's Island is now occupied by the United States army, necessitating the rehabilitation of a number of persons who previously resided on what is known as leased territory. The Bermuda airport, used by seaplanes, is situated on Darrell's Island. The islands form an almost continuous chain, and there is uninterrupted communication by railway, road, bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset, and over Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island, a distance of about 22 miles.

**HISTORY**

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, after whom they were called "The Bermudas." The Spaniards, however, took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers' ship *The Sea Venture*, while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the Admiral's ship "The Sea Venture Flat."

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudez, called the group after him "The Somers' Islands." The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land, taken home by Somers' nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I, but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers, called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands," and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers.

**CONSTITUTION**

Representative government was introduced into the colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the governors have always been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, consisting of four official and three unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 3,231 electors, the electoral qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240. The members of the Executive Council and the Legislature are paid at the rate of 16s. for each day's attendance.

With the enactment of the Women's Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

**POPULATION**

The total population, excluding naval, military and air force personnel, is estimated at 34,965. English is universally spoken.

* Last census taken.

Population of City of Hamilton, 3,000 (approximately); town of St. George's, 1,300 (approximately).

**ADMINISTRATION**

Hamilton and St. George's have been incorporated as municipalities since 1793 and 1797 respectively, and there are nine parish vestries, all the members of which, as well as the two municipal corporations, are elected annually.

The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 12s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property.

The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in a like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100.

Both corporations are local boards of health in their respective districts.

The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy parish rates, a further source of income being obtained under the Liquor Licence Act, licensees paying a certain annual sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

**RELIGION**

All denominations are fully represented throughout the colony, there being 44 places of worship, as follows:

- Church of England 16; Church of Scotland 1; Presbyterian 1; Wesleyan Methodist 11; Roman Catholic 5; and African Methodist Episcopal 10.

There is accommodation for 13,000 persons in the various churches.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

The coins in circulation are British currency which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £783,422 were in circulation on 31st December, 1946. There are two incorporated banks, the Bank of Bermuda, Ltd., and the Bank
of N. T. Butterfield & Son, Ltd. A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and there are branches at Hamilton, St. George's and Sandys parish. The total number of depositors at the end of 1946 was 7,731, the total deposits being £183,381 during that year.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Postal**

Letters from England usually take between three and seven days by air-mail, surface mail being uncertain at present, but nine to twelve days was the average pre-war time for this method of conveyance. Postage rates are:

- **Letters.**
  - Within the colony, per oz. 1½d. ¼d. per 2 oz.
  - To U.K., Dominions, India, ¼d. per 2 oz.
  - Colonies and Protectorates, per oz., 2½d.
  - To all other countries, per oz., ¼d. per 2 oz. 3d.

- **Letters, Air Mail**
  - To U.K. (air-letter forms) . . 6d.
  - To U.K., per ½ oz. . . . . 1s. 3d.
  - To United States and Canada, 6d. per ½ oz.
  - To other countries, from 1s. 6d. to 3s. 9d. according to destination.

- **Parcel Post**
  - To U.K., 1 lb to 3 lb., 2s. 6d.; 3 lb. to 7 lb., 6s.; 7 lb. to 11 lb., 9s. 3d.; 11 lb. to 22 lb. 15s. 9d.

**Railways and Ferries**

The government-owned light railway service between St. George's and Somerset is to be discontinued and the railway sold. Between Somerset and Hamilton there is a regular ferry service which also connects Hamilton with the parishes of Paget and Warwick.

**Roads**

There are approximately 109 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads.

Legislation providing for the operation of motor vehicles on the highways of the colony was finally enacted in August, 1946, and, with certain limitations covering size, horse-power and speed, motor cars, taxis, buses, trucks and auto-bicycles may now be used.

Private motor cars and taxis must not exceed the following specifications: horse-power 10, overall length 160 inches, and overall width 64 inches.

No person may use a motor car which, at the time of its importation, was second-hand.

Annual licence fees are assessed at the rate of £2 per horse-power.

Prior to 1939, the use of motor vehicles, with the exception of those operated in connection with certain essential services, was prohibited, but during the war the necessity arose for an all-round speed up of communications and a number of vehicles were allowed on the roads.

During this time Bermuda became conscious of the advantages to be gained by allowing the general use of motorised transport and, in addition to private cars and taxis, buses now operate throughout the colony.

**Air**

British Overseas Airways Corporation and Pan American Airways maintain a regular service between Bermuda and the United States, in addition to which British South American Airways make weekly flights from the United Kingdom to South America, stops being made at Bermuda in each direction.

**Shipping**

Before the war, communication between Bermuda and the United Kingdom was maintained by vessels of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, Ltd., which made regular calls at Bermuda every month outward and homeward. This service has been disrupted during the past six years but will, no doubt, be resumed later. Prior to September, 1939, communication between Bermuda and New York was provided by the palatial Monarch of Bermuda and Queen of Bermuda which made bi-weekly sailings. These two vessels were withdrawn at the outbreak of war but the Furness-Bermuda Line has started a regular passenger service with ships of smaller capacity. The Monarch of Bermuda became a total loss following a disastrous fire which broke out when she was being reconditioned on the Tyne, but it is hoped that the Queen of Bermuda will resume her regular trips some time in 1948. There is a regular freight service between Canadian and American ports and the colony.

**Cables and Wireless, etc.**

Cable & Wireless (West Indies), Limited, operate the overseas telegraph and telephone communications systems in Bermuda.

A direct cable to Halifax, N.S., forms an undersea link with North America, etc., and a relay point with Great Britain and countries beyond.

With a southerly cable landing at Turks Island and from thence to Jamaica in one direction and Barbados in the other, the West Indies and general Caribbean area is well served.

Wireless telegraph circuits are also maintained with the R.C.A. and Mackay Radio systems in New York.

The wireless transmitting station situated at St. George's and its receiving counterpart at Store Hill, provide the community with adequate radio facilities.

A ship-to-shore telegraph service is available and doubtless this will be extended before long to telephony with certain equipped vessels, in conformity with pre-war arrangements.

Medium and shore wave direction-finding bearings are available upon request.

A radio-telephone circuit is operated with New York, which puts the community in telephonic communication with all parts of the U.S.A., Canada, and numerous other countries.

A recent development of this aspect of the company's operations is the establishment of a direct radio-telephone circuit with London, thus giving instantaneous service with the United Kingdom.

The Company is also under contract with the Air Ministry and Bermuda Government to provide all types of radio services required in connection with the operation of the Bermuda airport and general civil aeronautical services.

The privately-owned Bermuda Telephone Company has 2,600 subscribers with about 26,500 miles of wire, a large portion of which is in underground cables.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Health**

The level of health in the colony is high and is safeguarded by the General Board of Health with a senior medical officer, district medical officers, sanitary inspectors, etc.
The Bermuda Welfare Society (which is State aided) maintains district nurses in each parish.

The legislature provided £41,500 and £3,700 respectively for the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital and the Bermuda Nursing Home towards their operation in 1946.

**Education**

In 1839 the colonial legislature first granted a sum of money to aid elementary schools.

The central control is vested in a Board of Education consisting of 10 members appointed by the Governor under the provisions of the Schools Act, 1922.

There is no free education, apart from a number of local scholarships, all schools charging fees which vary from 6d. a week to about £20 per annum. Attendance is compulsory, the school leaving age being 13 years, and when accommodation is increased this will be raised to 14 years.

During 1946 there were 26 State-aided schools with a roll of 5,363 scholars. In addition there were 16 schools which received no financial aid.

In 1927 the Legislature established an annual Scholarship of £200, tenable for a term of three years at some educational institution abroad to be approved by the Governor, with a view to assisting youths to prepare to compete for the Rhodes' Scholarship awarded to Bermuda. The value of the scholarship was increased to £280 in 1946.

During 1924 the Bermuda (Technical Education) Scholarship Act was passed, establishing four new scholarships each of the value of £125, subsequently increased to £150 and to £210 in 1946, tenable for four years at some educational institution out of the Colony.

Since March, 1939, when the Bermuda Scholarships for Girls Act was passed, two annual scholarships have been made available to girls for education out of Bermuda. Tenable for a period of three years, the original value of £200 per annum was increased to £280 in 1946.

**Labour Services**

The Labour Board, whose chairman is a member of the Legislature, maintains an office for the purpose of co-ordinating the supply of and demand for labour. There is legislation for the settlement of labour disputes and trade unions were legalised in October, 1946. None had registered at the end of 1946.
