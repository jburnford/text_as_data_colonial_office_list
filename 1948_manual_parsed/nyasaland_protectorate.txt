NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

SITUATION AND AREA
The Protectorate comprises the western shore of Lake Nyasa, with the high tablelands separating it from the basin of the Loangwa River, and the region lying between the watershed of the Zambesi and the Shire Rivers on the west, and the Lakes Chiuta and Chilwa and the River Ruo (an affluent of the Shire) on the east, including the mountain systems of the Shire Highlands and Mlanje.

In the absence of adequate survey it is not possible to state accurately the total area, but according to latest estimates the land area is believed to be some 36,829 square miles.

CLIMATE
There are two distinct climates in the Protectorate, one of the plains and the other of the hills. In the part of the Great Rift Valley which traverses the country from end to end and is occupied for the greater part by Lake Nyasa and the Shire Valley, the climate is hot and unhealthy with temperatures sometimes reaching 120° in the shade just before the rains. Rainfall in this zone does not as a rule exceed 35 inches.

The upland areas are healthier with temperatures varying between a maximum of 97° and a minimum of 40°; at some of the higher elevations temperatures occasionally fall below 40° and frost is sometimes recorded at night. Rainfall in this zone varies from 40 to 100 inches.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
It is bounded on the north-east by Tanganyika territory, on the north-west by Northern Rhodesia, on the south-east, south-west by Portuguese East Africa. The south-eastern boundary with Portuguese East Africa at Lake Nyasa is the eastern or Portuguese coast of the lake and thus the greater part of the Lake Nyasa is contained within the boundaries of the Protectorate.
History

There are various Portuguese records from 1616 onwards of occasional journeys across the southern end of what is now the Nyasaland Protectorate, and in the eighteenth century Portuguese officials and miners penetrated as far as the Luangwa Valley in Northern Rhodesia, but these left no lasting impression on the country. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century there was constant passage through and settlement in Nyasaland by migrating Bantu tribes, but their traditions are too vague to be given the name of history, which, for Nyasaland, may be said to begin with David Livingstone’s discovery of Lake Nyasa on 16th September, 1859.

The path he opened was followed by the pioneers of the Universities’ Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), but these soon had to retire after heavy losses from disease, and the Universities’ Mission did not return to Nyasaland until 1881. Inspired by Livingstone’s work, both the Church of Scotland and the Free Church of Scotland established Missions as memorials to him. In 1874-5, at a time when the country was a whirlpool of migrant tribes, warring with each other and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers, the work of pacification which occupied most of the remainder of the nineteenth century owed much to the missionary leaders. To relieve them of the business side of their activities the African Lakes Company (now the African Lakes Corporation) was formed in 1878 as a transport and trading concern to work in close co-operation with the Scots Missions. These pioneers were followed by other Europeans, missionaries, traders, hunters, and coffee planters, and in 1883 a British Consul, resident at Blantyre, was accredited to “the Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa”; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government.

By now the first of Nyasaland’s nineteenth century invaders, the Angoni—who are entitled to claim descent from Chaka’s Zulus—had almost ended their wanderings, which had taken them in 50 years from Natal to Lake Tanganyika and back to the hinterland of Lake Nyasa. The Yaos, starting from somewhere about the headwaters of the Rovuma River, on the modern border between Tanganyika Territory and Portuguese East Africa, were still on the move round the south end of Lake Nyasa, warring as they went. At the same time the slave-traders at the north end of the country were becoming steadily more inconvenienced by the competition in religion and commerce with which they were now faced, and in 1888 trouble, followed by open warfare, arose between the Arab leaders of the trade and the African Lakes Company, who had to expend most of their resources on military operations. Fortunately for Nyasaland it came under the eye of Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company came to the financial rescue.

About this time, too, the Portuguese Government began to cast interested eyes on the lands to the north of the Zambesi, on which river it had long had military and trading posts, and there was a certain degree of international friction. In 1889, however, one cause of friction was removed by the discovery of a navigable route through the Zambesi delta from the Indian Ocean which made Nyasaland accessible, by way of this route, the Zambesi, and the Shire, by an international waterway without touching Portuguese territory. Nevertheless, in the same year a conflict took place on the Lower Shire between a well-armed Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto and one of the Makololo chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on 21st September, 1889, almost exactly 30 years after Livingstone first set foot on the shores of Lake Nyasa. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the territory was changed to “The British Central Africa Protectorate”, but in 1907 a further Order-in-Council revived the old name of “The Nyasaland Protectorate”.

By 1896 the slave trade was extinguished and the countries of the Yao and the Southern Angoni were pacified, although the Northern Angoni did not come fully within the sphere of British Administration until 1904. They had, however, long given up raiding their neighbours, largely because of the influence acquired over their Paramount Chief by Dr. Laws of Livingstonia. Since then Nyasaland has known only one internal disturbance, the Chilembwe Rising, which occurred in 1915, when a native pastor, egged on by the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges. Rapid counter-measures were taken and the rising fizzled out. To the credit of the rebels it must be recorded that such European women and children as fell into their hands were treated with great consideration.

In 1914 the long border with German East Africa made Nyasaland’s position dangerous, but prompt action on both land and water scotched the immediate danger, and the Protectorate was able to contribute greatly to the British forces employed in the East African campaign. The outbreak of war in 1939 found the Protectorate far from any front, but nevertheless able to aid the war effort considerably in both men and materials. The two regular battalions of the King’s African Rifles were expanded to 12, who added Abyssinia, Madagascar and Burma to a list of campaigning grounds which already covered Africa from British Somaliland to Ashanti, and in all some 30,000 of all races in Nyasaland served in the armed forces between 1939 and 1945.

Constitution and Administration

The administration of the protectorate, control of which was transferred to the Colonial Office from the Foreign Office in March, 1904, was originally conducted by a Commissioner and Consul-General, assisted by the Deputy and Assistant Deputy Commissioner. On transfer to the Colonial Office the post of Consul-General was abolished, and by an Order-in-Council which came into force in October, 1907, the Commissioner became a Governor and Commander-in-Chief. By the same order Executive and Legislative Councils were established. The former at present consists of the Governor, three ex officio members, and three nominated members, two of the latter being unofficials. The Legislative Council, of which the Governor is President, consists of six official members and six unofficials, of whom five are nominated by the Governor on the advice of unofficial bodies and the sixth is chosen from among the missionary organisations and is specifically charged with the representation of native interests.
Native local government was instituted in 1933, the traditionally-appointed tribal chiefs being established as Native Authorities with powers defined by law. African Provincial Councils were established in 1944 and 1945, consisting of chiefs and leading commoners, and an African Protectorate Council, drawn from the Provincial Councils, was established in 1946; these Councils discuss and advise the Government upon matters affecting the native population.

The laws consist of local ordinances duly enacted, with such British acts as are of general application. Justice is administered in the High Court, which has jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, and also as a Court of Admiralty. Subordinate courts are held by magistrates and assistant magistrates in the various districts. Appeals from decisions of the High Court are now heard by the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Court of Appeal. There is also a system of Native Courts, in many cases under the presidency of Native Authorities. These deal with the great majority of native civil cases and with a large number of petty criminal matters and statutory offences. Appeals from these lie to Native Appeal Courts and thence through the District and Provincial Commissioners to the High Court.

**THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COUNCIL**

During the late war the need was felt for closer consultation and co-operation between the three Central African territories, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and Southern Rhodesia, and an Inter-Territorial Secretariat was established in Salisbury in 1941. This was replaced in 1945 by a Central African Council under the chairmanship of the Governor of Southern Rhodesia and consisting of three representatives of each territory, those from Nyasaland being at present the Governor, the Chief Secretary, and the Hon. Mr. M. P. Barrow, C.B.E., a Nominated Member of Executive Council and Legislative Council. The Council meets twice a year, and carries on its work through a permanent Secretariat and a number of Committees. Its functions are consultative and advisory in character.

**POPULATION**

The protectorate is divided into three provinces, Northern, Central and Southern, each under the control of a provincial commissioner. These provinces are sub-divided into 14 administrative areas, each in charge of a district commissioner, who is also a district magistrate.

The chief town is Blantyre, in the Shire Highlands. There were 699 Europeans and 1,168 Asiatics in the Blantyre district in 1945. The Headquarters of the Government are at Zomba. The figures of population given by the 1945 census were: Europeans, 1,948; Asiatics, 2,804; Africans, 2,044,707. The estimated population at the end of 1946 was: Europeans, 2,400; Asiatics, 3,100; Africans, 2,225,000.

**INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE**

The chief exportable products of the protectorate are tobacco (flue- and air- and dark-fired cured), tea, cotton, pulses, groundnuts, rice and tung. Amongst minor products exported from the protectorate may be mentioned soya beans, rubber, chillies, cottonseed, potatoes and beeswax. Crops cultivated for home consumption include maize, millets, cassava, sweet potatoes, groundnuts, rice, sugar cane, wheat, coffee, pulses, plantains and bananas.

Essentially an agricultural country, Nyasaland depends for its volume of trade on the yield of its crops and the prices obtained for them. In 1946 export products were good in quality and volume and satisfactory prices were realised. The chief exportable products were tobacco (flue-, air-and dark-fired cured), representing 33·10 per cent. of the total volume of export trade; tea, 25·84 per cent.; cotton lint, 7·15 per cent.; soya beans, 2·80 per cent. Other exports included groundnuts, dried fish, cotton seed, capsicums, pulses, potatoes, rubber and beeswax.

The Nyasaland Customs Tariff applies equally to imports from all nations in view of agreements ratified under the Congo Basin Treaties, 1895, and the Convention of St. Germain-en-Laye, 1919. Import duties are mainly levied ad valorem on c.i.f. Beira and vary from 3 per cent. to 50 per cent. Specific duties apply to such goods as cotton manufactures, beer, wines and spirits, cigarettes and tobacco, matches, motor vehicles, bicycles, petrol and fuel oils. The tariff provides for a wide range of duty-free imports such as medicines, agricultural and industrial implements and machinery, building materials, sanitary ware and plant for water and electrical installations.

Export duty is not levied but there is a cess of 10d. on each 100 lbs. of tea, 1½d. on each 100 lbs. of tobacco and £2 10s. on each long ton of tung oil exported. The revenue realised from these cesses is returned to the Tea, Tobacco and Tung Associations for the benefit of the respective industries.

The value of external trade in 1946, excluding specie but including re-exports and Government imports, was £4,415,146, compared with £3,496,885 in 1945. Domestic imports were valued at £2,050,176 and exports £2,364,970, registering a favourable trade balance of exports amounting to £314,794. The figures for the previous year were: imports £1,620,822, and exports £1,876,063.

Principal imports were: cotton manufactures, £739,613, of which £598,881 represented the value of cotton piece goods; iron, steel, and metal manufactures, £100,358; petrol, £62,654; vehicles and parts, £60,891; wood and timber manufactures (chiefly tea and tobacco shocks), £55,813; earthenware and chinaware (including cement), £44,358; agricultural implements and machinery, £39,934; bicycles, £38,959; tyres and tubes, £38,622; oils and fats (chiefly for soap making), £33,753; provisions, £29,317; matches, £28,753; boots and shoes, £24,613.

Exports were: tobacco, 7,916 tons, locally valued at £1,252,806; tea, 6,178 tons, £749,624; cotton lint, 1,709 tons, £126,252; groundnuts, 1,387 tons, £34,882; tung oil, 106 tons, £25,303.

The United Kingdom supplied 36·63 per cent. of imports, British Empire countries 35·10 per cent. and other foreign countries 28·27 per cent. The United Kingdom absorbed 55·85 per cent. of total exports, the British Empire 30·93 per cent. and other foreign countries 13·22 per cent.

During the war years a number of local industries grew up and showed considerable expansion. In 1946 tobacco and cigarette making for local consumption was valued at £60,000; soap making at £50,000; sisal rope and twine, £15,000. These industries employ a considerable number of skilled and unskilled European, Asian and African labour.

The following table shows the origin and value of trade imports:—

*Note.—Government imports included. Specie excluded.*

**EDUCATION**

In 1944 the Secretary of State approved a five-year plan for the development of the education of all races in the protectorate, and supported it with a grant of £345,000, from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote, to cover capital expenditure up to £65,000, and one-half of the total recurrent expenditure over the five-year period (£280,000). In April, 1945, a new Education Ordinance was enacted to give retrospective effect to the plan as from 1st January, 1945. Its operation is reflected in the increase of the Government grant to missions for African education from approximately £11,500 in 1939, to £66,944 in 1946. The development programme also includes provision for technical training and the extension of secondary education in the case of Africans, scholarships for university education for all races, and experimental work in mass education, particularly in adult literacy, at the Jeanes Centre.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

By a proclamation of February, 1894, the legal currency is declared to be English sterling, and by Proclamation No. 11 of 1933, Rhodesian silver coin was declared legal tender.

Banking operations in the protectorate are governed by the Banking Ordinance, 1902.

Two banks have branches at Blantyre, the principal trading centre of the country, viz., the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., and Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas); the former has branches at Zomba, Limbe and Lilongwe, and the latter has a branch at Limbe.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There is a 3 feet 6 inches gauge railway system extending from the port of Beira, in Portuguese East Africa, to Chipoka on Lake Nyasa (496 miles) crossing the Zambesi at Sena (199 miles) by the Lower Zambesi Bridge and passing through Blantyre (353 miles). Main roads and "carrier" roads are open all over the protectorate, the total mileage being 3,856. The Nyasaland road system is linked up with the Great North Road to Tanganyika territory and Kenya Colony, and also to the Portuguese road system through Tete to Southern Rhodesia.

There are aerodromes suitable for all types of aircraft at Chileka and Lilongwe, and for light aircraft at Zomba; and seasonal landing grounds are available at all district stations.

The Empire air mail scheme (Southampton-Durban) which was inaugurated in June, 1937, has been replaced by the all African overland route. Letter mails to and from the United Kingdom and other participating countries in the Empire air mail scheme are despatched twice weekly by the South African Airways Springbok service and Central African Airways feeder service via Salisbury. The Central African Airways also operates six air services per week between Salisbury and Blantyre.
