ADEN

ADEN COLONY

SITUATION AND AREA

The Colony of Aden is situated in latitude 12° 47' N. and longitude 45° 10' E. about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb on the south coast of Arabia.

The island of Perim in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb and the Kuria Muria Islands, five in number, off the Dhufar coast of Oman, also form part of the colony.

The total area of the Colony, exclusive of Perim, is 75 square miles, that of Aden proper, 21 square miles, and Little Aden 15 square miles. The flat strip of coast joining the peninsulas is about 39 square miles in extent.

CLIMATE

The climate of Aden Colony is not unhealthy though the heat and humidity are trying between April and October. During the north-east monsoon, that is, between the latter part of October and April, the climate is generally cool and pleasant. During the south-west monsoon, i.e., in July and August, strong winds prevail which give some relief from the damp airless heat of May, June and September. Sandstorms are apt to occur in the months of May, June, July and August. These come from a northerly direction usually a short time before sunset and are often very intense, though of short duration. The weather during July and August is frequently very hazy, and it is not uncommon for ships to pass quite close to Aden without picking up the land. The rainfall is extremely scanty and in some years non-existent; but as much as eight inches have been known to fall in a year.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Colony of Aden consists of two extinct volcanic craters forming rocky peninsulas joined by a flat sandy foreshore. Aden proper is on the south and Little Aden on the west. The peninsulas form the horns of Aden Bay, which is about eight miles broad from east to west and about four miles deep. Its entrance is about three miles across. On the west side of the Aden Peninsula is Steamer Point the principal military and port area.

The Aden Peninsula is arid, rocky and of volcanic formation and Jabal Shamsan, its summit, is 1,808 feet (551 m.) high. Crater, the main Arab town, is situated five miles from the main port and lies in the crater of the extinct volcano forming the peninsula.

The isthmus is a flat sandy plain, barely three-quarters of a mile wide at its narrowest point near the peninsula, joining the latter with the mainland and containing the colony's principal aerodrome.

Some cultivation occurs at Sheikh Othman, at the base of the isthmus, in a garden under the management of the Township Authority, but except during the cold weather months produce is very limited. There are also privately-owned date gardens there. Hiswa, on the shore of Aden Bay, has groves of toddy palms. Salt is manufactured in large quantities on the flat shores of the bay, by the process of open evaporation.

Perim Island, situated in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, is bare, rocky and flat; its highest point, about a mile northward of its southern extremity, is 214 feet (65 m.) high. The surface of the island is grooved with dry water courses and covered with coarse grass and stunted shrubs, the subsoil being sand and conglomerate coral. It possesses a good small harbour on the southwest side, with an entrance 860 yards in breadth, and an emergency landing ground on the north side.

HISTORY

Aden, after being a trade centre under its native kings, became subject in succession to the Abyssinians, the Persians and the early Caliphs. In 1538 it was captured by the Turks, who lost it some years later, but captured it again in 1551 and held it until they evacuated the Yemen in 1630. The Aden Peninsula was occupied by the British in 1839, and in 1868 Little Aden was obtained by purchase. The coastal strip between the two peninsulas was secured by purchase in 1882 and 1888.

Perim Island was first occupied by the French in 1738. In 1799 the British took formal possession but evacuated the island in the same year. It was later reoccupied by the British in January, 1857, and placed under the control of an Assistant to the Political Resident at Aden. In 1929, the manager of the Perim Coal Company was appointed Government Agent, but on the closing down of that company in October, 1936, the Commissioner of Police, Aden, was appointed Administrator of the island. A police detachment is maintained at Perim, and the Administrator makes regular visits from Aden, usually by air.

CONSTITUTION

Under the provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the Aden Colony Order, 1936, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Aden ceased to be a part of British India and was constituted as a Colony of Aden as from 1st April, 1937.

Under the Royal Instructions dated 3rd March, 1937, as subsequently amended by Additional Instructions dated 2nd July, 1940, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the officer lawfully discharging the functions of Chief Secretary and such other persons as may from time to time be appointed by His Majesty by any Instructions or Warrants under His Sign Manual and Signet, or as the Governor may, by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony, appoint in pursuance of instructions from His Majesty through one of His Principal Secretaries of State, or as the Governor may provisionally appoint in the manner provided in the Royal Instructions.

Whenever upon any special occasion the Governor desires to obtain the advice of any person within the Colony relating to affairs therein, he may summon such person, for such special occasion, as an Extraordinary Member of the Council.

Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which was brought into force from 24th October, 1946 a Legislative Council was constituted for the Colony of Aden. The Council was inaugurated in January, 1947, and consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, not more than four official members and not more than eight unofficial members.

The ex officio members are the senior officer for the time being in and stationed in the Colony in command of His Majesty's Regular Forces therein (excluding the Governor or officer administering the government of the Colony) and the persons for the time being lawfully discharging
the functions of the respective offices of Chief Secretary, Attorney General and Financial Secretary of the Colony.

The official members are persons holding office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the above cited Order, are appointed by Instructions or Warrant under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, or by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in pursuance of His Majesty's Instructions through the Secretary of State.

The unofficial members are persons not holding office of emolument under the Crown in the Colony, and subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the above cited Order, are appointed by Instructions or Warrant under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, or by the Governor by an Instrument under the Public Seal of the Colony in pursuance of His Majesty's Instructions through the Secretary of State.

The Governor of the Colony is also Governor of the Aden Protectorate, which is not administered by the Colony Government. The Governor is empowered and commanded to exercise on His Majesty's behalf all such powers and jurisdiction as His Majesty now has, or may from time to time be enjoined upon him, in accordance with the Aden Protectorate Order dated 18th March, 1937, as amended by Aden Protectorate (Amendment) Order, 1940 and the Aden Protectorate Royal Instructions dated 24th March, 1937.

ADMINISTRATION

The colony is administered by a Governor, who is also Commander-in-Chief, aided by an Executive Council which at present comprises four members.

Under the provisions of the Aden Colony (Amendment) Order, 1944, which came into force on 24th October, 1946, a Legislative Council was established in Aden in January, 1947. There is no one Government for the Aden Protectorate. In each of the Western and Eastern protectorates the Governor is represented by a British agent who deals with the various Rulers and Treaty Chiefs on the basis of treaties concluded with them. The Protectorate includes the island of Socotra.

The administration of justice within the Colony is entrusted to the Supreme Court, a Court of Small Causes for certain specified civil cases and Magistrates courts for criminal cases. In judicial cases the right of appeal to the High Court of Bombay has been preserved.

The law of the Protectorate is largely tribal custom, but in certain chiefdoms the Shafai Code of Moslem law (Shari'a) is recognised, especially in the Qu'aiti State of Shehr and Mukalla (Ruler, His Highness Sultan Sir Saleh bin Ghalib al Qu'aiti, K.C.M.G.) which State legislates by published decrees.

Aden is a free port and there is no customs tariff. Excise duty is, however, levied on a specific duty basis on spirits, wines and beer, perfumed spirits, intoxicating and dangerous drugs, tobacco and motor spirit. The management of the port is under the control of the Board of Trustees formed in 1888.

Under the Townships Ordinance, 1945, Township Authorities for the towns of Aden and for Sheikh Othman were constituted, and the various municipal operations formerly carried out by the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement now devolve on the Township Authorities.

The port facilities comprise an inner harbour offering good anchorage to a large number of vessels and also an outer harbour.

The harbour provides accommodation for nineteen first-class berths, five second-class berths and eight third-class berths suitable for large, medium and small vessels respectively. There are ten oil berths and oil can normally be pumped to six of these berths simultaneously. Three more oil berths are expected to be installed on the northern limits of the mooring basin in the near future. Three powerful tugs controlled by the Port Trust are available for berthing and unberthing vessels, and for special services such as fire-fighting, and also three floating docks. In addition, there are fifteen small privately-owned tugs suitable for towing lighters, which number 153. There are separate jetties for the landing and shipping of petroleum and munitions and private and public wharves which are suitable for lighters. Shed accommodation is available on some of the wharves, and the Port Trust has sheds on the Maala wharf covering an area of 16,300 square yards.

Moderate repairs to hull and machinery can be carried out by local firms.

The Post Trust employ three divers.

The approach channel and major part of mooring basin is dredged to 36 feet low water Indian Spring Tides (L.W. Ind. S.T.).

In normal times of peace vessels of many principal steamship companies call regularly at Aden, connecting with all parts of the world.

Aden is an entrepot for trade with Arabia and other adjacent territories. The exports consist of coffee, gums, skins and hides, cotton goods, dyes, feathers, spices, etc.

RELIGION

The majority of the population is Moslem but there are communities of Jews, Hindus and Zoroastrians. There are two Anglican churches and two Roman Catholic churches, one of each situated in Steamer Point and Crater, and one Presbyterian and Methodist church in Steamer Point.
Currency and Banking

Banking

The National Bank of India, Ltd., is established in the colony with its chief office in the Crater and a branch at Steamer Point. The Exchange Bank of India and Africa, Ltd., has a branch in Crater. The commercial firm of Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw & Bros. also carries on the business of banking.

Currency

The monetary unit is the Indian rupee (silver) and is legal tender for any amount.

Communications

Mails

Surface mails between Aden and all parts of the world are exchanged as opportunity offers by fairly frequent, but for the time being irregular, steamship services using the port.

Air mails to and from all parts of the world are exchanged several times weekly by the service operated by the B.O.A.C. between Aden and Cairo, which calls at Kamaran, Asmara and Port Sudan. At Cairo this service connects with the main trunk services of the B.O.A.C. operating between London and South Africa, and between London and India, Malaya and the East, and Australia. Additional air mails are exchanged by B.O.A.C. services twice weekly with Hargeisa (Somaliland) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia).

The Ethiopian Air Lines operate a bi-weekly service between Aden—Addis Ababa (or Dire Dawa) and Jibuti and once fortnightly (as a temporary measure) to Mukalla.

The Clairways Air Service operate a weekly service between Aden—Nairobi via Hargeisa, Mogadiscio and Kismayo.

Telephones

An automatic telephone system serves the whole colony. There are about 921 telephones including those in Government and military offices, either connected directly to the main exchange or through private branch exchanges.

External Telecommunications

Cable & Wireless (M.E.), Ltd., are responsible for all external civil communications. They own and operate a cable station from which their submarine cables connect with countries all over the world. They also operate wireless telegraph services from Aden to Mukalla in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and between Aden and Addis Ababa in Abyssinia, Djibouti in French Somaliland, Hargeisa in British Somaliland and Kamaran in the Red Sea.

A cable from Aden connects with Perim whence another cable belonging to the Yemen extends to Sheikh Said, thus linking Perim and the Yemen with all parts of the world through the company's system.

There is no internal telegraph system and there are no railways.

Social Services

Medical Services

There is a Government civil hospital (300 beds) in Crater, and a maternity and child welfare clinic (15 maternity beds and two children's wards of five beds each). There is a hospital of the Keith Falconer Mission at Sheikh Othman (60 beds).

There are two dispensaries organised by charity catering especially for sick poor, and a small Government dispensary at Perim Island.

Public health work is supervised by a Medical Officer of Health under the control of the Director of Medical Services. The infectious diseases hospital (100 beds) is also under his care.

The Port Health Officer is responsible for the out-patient treatment of members of the merchant navies on vessels in port. He is also in charge of routine quarantine administration and the maintenance of Flint Island quarantine station.

Educational Facilities

Education in Aden Colony is under the control of the Director of Education. In the Eastern and Western Aden Protectorates it is, in common with other services, under the immediate general guidance of the British Agents. But the Aden Government Department of Education inspects schools within the area, gives such advice and assistance as is required and co-ordinates, in so far as possible, educational development throughout the whole territory.

In the Colony Government maintains four boys' and two girls' primary schools and one Boys' Secondary School. There are in addition eight aided primary schools for boys, five of which have a secondary section and four aided primary schools for girls, two of which have a secondary section. There are also a number of unrecognised schools. In all schools in the Colony there are approximately 5,000 pupils in primary or indigenous school classes (including 980 girls) and 705 pupils in secondary schools (including 210 girls). There is no post-secondary education given in the Colony. A number of students are sent abroad on scholarships for further education and a Scholarship Committee has been nominated to investigate and advise Government on scholarships to be awarded.

Classes for adult females are conducted at the Government Girls' School. Commercial classes are held at the Government Secondary School and at a privately run commercial institution but there is at present no provision for technical education. It is hoped, however, that on the arrival of a Technical Instructor from United Kingdom to commence such classes.

There is an educational advisory committee representing the principal communities in the Colony.

The British Council opened an Institute for men in 1940 and an Institute for women in 1942.

Labour.

There are no organised labour services in the colony. The inhabitants of Aden are principally engaged in trading, shop-keeping and domestic employment. The large number of coolies employed by the salt works, shipping concerns and contractors are drawn from the Aden Protectorate or the Yemen. The small harbour craft are mostly manned by Somalis.

**ADEN PROTECTORATE**

**Situation and Area**

The Aden Protectorate, which can be more conveniently described administratively and geographically by dividing it into two areas, the Western and Eastern, has a total superficial area of about 112,000 square miles. It is bounded on the east by the western boundary of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, on the north and west by the Ruba' Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) and the Kingdom of the Yemen (whose southern boundary was temporarily stabilised by Article III of the Treaty of Sana'a of 11th February, 1934, by which His Majesty's Government and the Government of the Yemen agreed to maintain the status quo as on the date of the signature of the treaty), and on the south by the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. The Aden Protectorate seaboard starts at Husn Murad (opposite Perim) on the west and runs for 740 miles eastwards to Ras Dhurbat Ali where it meets the frontier of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman.

**Climate**

The maritime plains are damp and hot in the summer and are subject to sand storms and high winds. In the winter (October to the end of March) it is cool and sometimes cold at night and much less damp.

In the mountains, which vary in height between 1,500 and 8,000 feet, it is drier and cooler during the day and night above 2,500 feet; and above 4,500 feet it can be very cold.

In the Wadi Hadramaut and the intervening tableland or "Jol" extremes of both heat and cold are encountered. The heat in contrast to that of the coast is dry but more intense. The rainfall is small.

There is little rainfall in the littoral and maritime hills: here cultivation is chiefly dependent on irrigation from water channels and courses. In the highlands well irrigation is common and there is heavier rainfall which is led down ravines and defiles into terraced fields.

**General Description**

The Western Aden Protectorate is divided into (a) the littoral belt which varies between 4 and 40 miles in depth; (b) the maritime ranges about 1,000-2,000 feet above sea level; (c) the intramontane plains over 3,000 feet high; and (d) the highland plateau ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet high and which falls away into the Ruba' Al Khali (or Empty Quarter) with a mean altitude of 2,500 feet. The country between the littoral belt on the one hand and the intramontane plains and the plateau on the other is a tangle of mountains, ravines and valleys. Some of the valleys are very fertile. The plateau itself is broken up by numerous hills and mountains and is intersected with several deep valleys.

The greater part of the Eastern Aden Protectorate consists of desert and barren mountains intersected by Wadis, some of which are fertile and cultivated. There are a number of comparatively large towns notably Mukalla, the capital of the Qu'aiti State and principal seaport, and Seiyun the capital of the Kathiri State.

The Western Aden Protectorate consists of the following tribal districts, the chiefs of which are in protective treaty relations with His Majesty's Government:

Abdali, Sultan Fadl Abdul Karim, Sultan of Lahej, who is the premier chief of the western area.

Amiri, Amir Nasr bin Shaif Seif, C.M.G. Capital, Dhala.

Fadhli, Sultan Abdullah bin Uthman. Capital, Shuqra.

Lower Yafa'i, Sultan 'Aidrus bin Muhsin. Capital, Al Qara.

Haushabi, Sultan Muhammad bin Sarur. Capital, Muscinir.

Upper Yafa'i Confederation, Sultan Muhammad bin Salih. Capital, Mahjaba. Mausatta, Sheikh Ahmed Bubakr 'Ali 'Askar and Sheikh Husein Salih Muhsin 'Askar. Capital, Al Qudma. Dhubi, Sheikship vacant. Capital, Dhi Sura. Maflahi, Sheikh Qasim 'Abdurrahman. Capital, Al Jurba. Hadhrami, Sheikh Muhammad Muhsin Ghalib. Capital, Ash Shibr.

Shaib, Sheikh Muhammad Muqbil As Saqladi. Capital, Bakhal.

Quteibi, Sheikh Hasan 'Ali. Capital, Ath Thumeir.

Alawi, Sheikh Salih Sayil. Capital, Al Qash'a.

Aqrabi, Sheikh Muhammad Fadhl Ba 'Abdullah. Capital, Bir Ahmed.

Audhai, Sultan Salih bin Husein. Capital, Lodar.

Upper 'Aulagi, Sultan 'Awadh bin Salih bin Abdullah. Capital, Nisab. Sheikh Muhsin bin Farid. Capital, Yeshbum.

Lower 'Aulagi, Sultan 'Aidrus bin Abdullah. Capital, Ahwar.

Beihan, Sharif Salih bin Husein. Capital, An Nugub.

Subeibi, Sheikhs Muhammad 'Ali Ba Salih, Sheikh Muhammad bin 'Ali, of the Barhimi and Abdullah ba Sa'id of the 'Atifi.

The Eastern Aden Protectorate comprises the Hadhramaut (consisting of the Qu'aiti State of Shihr and Mukalla and the Kathiri State of Seiyun), the Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socota, the Wahidi Sultanates of Bir 'Ali, and the Sheikdoms of Irqa and Haura, all of which have been for many years in protective treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. His Highness Sultan Sir Salih bin Ghalib al Qu'aiti, K.C.M.G., Sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, is the premier chief in the Eastern Aden Protectorate, and the Hadhramaut is the most important and best organised of these areas. It is bounded on the west by the Wahidi Sultanates and on the east by the Mahri Sultanate.

The Mahri Sultanate of Qishn and Socota is the most easterly area in the Aden Protectorate, being bounded on the east by the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. The Sultan of Qishn and Socota resides on the island of Socota, which lies off Africa, 150 miles from Cape Guardafui. The island was occupied by the East India Company in 1834, and it came under British protection, together with the neighbouring Abdal Kuri and Brothers Islands, in 1866, when the treaty with the Mahri Sultan was concluded. Socota produces aloes, dragons' blood and ghee. The population
is probably about 5,000; the island is rather less than 100 miles from east to west and about 30 miles broad. Its interior is mountainous and the Fidahan Haji rises to nearly 5,000 feet. The capital is Hadibu, known on European maps as Tamrida.

**HISTORY**

For a time in the 18th century, the Western Aden Protectorate formed part of the domain of the Imam of Sana'a (capital of the Yemen of today) and several of the rulers of the tribal districts such as the 'Abdali, Haushabi, Amiri, Yafa'i and 'Aulaqi sultans, were the Imam's "wakils" or governors until his power declined and they declared their independence. This occurred in 1728 in the case of the 'Abdali and in 1758 in the case of the Yafa'i.

After the occupation of Aden by the British in 1839, some of the neighbouring chiefs entered into protective treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. Others followed suit as time went on, the last to do so being the 'Audhali Sultan in 1914.

In July, 1915, during the first world war, the Turks, who then held the Yemen, occupied the 'Abdali, Haushabi and Amiri districts until the armistice of 1918.

In February, 1934, as has been stated, a Treaty of Friendship was signed between His Majesty's Government and the Kingdom of the Yemen.

In 1944 and 1945 five Western Aden Protectorate chiefs (the Fadhli, the Lower 'Aulaqi and the Lower Yafa'i sultans, the Sharif of Beihan and the Amir of Dhala') entered into closer relations with His Majesty's Government by new treaties in which they agreed, inter alia, to abide by the advice of the Governor of Aden in the improvement of their administrations.

The most important aspect of recent history in the Eastern Aden Protectorate has been the decline of the traditional power of the Kathiri sultans and the rise of the Qu'aiti—a dynasty with its origins among the Yafa'i tribes and influence arising from military and other services rendered as emigres to the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Qu'aiti rulers first entered into a treaty with His Majesty's Government in 1882. This was strengthened in 1888 by the conclusion of a Protectorate treaty in the common form of the treaties with the other Protectorate chiefs. In 1918 the Kathiri sultans made an agreement with the Qu'aiti sultan acknowledging this treaty as binding on them also. In 1937 and 1939 respectively the Qu'aiti and Kathiri sultans signed treaties undertaking to accept the advice of a British Resident Adviser in all matters except those concerning Muhammadan religion and custom. Relations with the smaller states are governed by similar Protectorate treaties.

**POPULATION**

The population of the Aden Protectorate is roughly estimated at 630,000.

**ADMINISTRATION**

The interests of the Western Aden Protectorate are looked after by a small cadre of British political officers and Arab assistant political officers under a British Agent, whose headquarters are in Aden. The political staff who are posted to administrative districts inland advise the local rulers on the administration of their areas, since His Majesty's Government does not administer the Protectorate directly.

The tribes nominate their own chiefs who have subsequently to be recognised by the Governor of Aden. Not all the chiefs have complete control over their subjects but, since 1943, the authority of some of them has been greatly increased by the introduction of simple administrative machinery. For internal security some of the chiefs have tribal guards (paid for by His Majesty's Government as a temporary measure) under the joint control of the British Agent and the chief. In 1937 the Aden Government raised a force known as the Government Guards for police duties in the Western Aden Protectorate; they are stationed inland in fixed posts and are paid for and controlled entirely by Government.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the principal states, Qu'aiti and Kathiri, are administered by their sultans as constitutional rulers. The Qu'aiti sultan has a state council. The Kathiri State is advancing slowly on the same lines, being hampered by the absence of an outlet to the sea and of the customs dues and other benefits which would result from it. The Wahidi States of Balhaf and Bir Ali have adopted simple administrations under the British Agent's supervision.

**RELIGION**

The people are Muslim Arabs of, almost entirely, the Shafa'i persuasion.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

In the Western Aden Protectorate rupees and riyals (or Maria Theresa dollars) are the currency used, the present (1946) rate of exchange being 24 rupees to the riyal.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, up to 1944, the Maria Theresa dollar was the currency used throughout the interior but in that year the rupee currency was officially adopted. Maria Theresa dollars, however, remain the normal form of currency in the Wahidi country and vicinity.

There are no banking facilities in the Aden Protectorate.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

There are no railways in the Aden Protectorate but several natural roads have been improved to take motor traffic. The chief of these in the Western Aden Protectorate are:

1. Aden (north and north-westwards) through Lahej to Ta'iz (Yemen) and to Dhala and Qataba (Yemen).
2. Aden westwards to Subaihi country.
3. Aden eastwards to—
   (a) Lower Yafa'.
   (b) Ahwar (Lower 'Aulaqi).
   (c) Fadhli country.
   (d) 'Audhali country.
   (e) Dathina.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate considerable progress has been made in recent years in road development, and routes run north of Mukalla to the Wadi Hadramaut, west to the provinces of Meifa'a-Hajz and Bir Ali, and east as far as Reidat Al Abdul Wadud.

Airfields are maintained by the Royal Air Force for communications of a political nature and for security work. The Ethiopian Air Lines operate a fortnightly service between Aden and Riyani (Mukalla) as a temporary measure. In normal times coastal steamers from Aden and a certain number of larger vessels on the India and the Far East routes call at Mukalla. Both
Qu’aiti and Kathiri States belong to the Aden Postal Union and have their own issues of stamps. Cable & Wireless, Ltd., maintain a wireless link between Mukalla Selyun and Aden and there is a network of political wireless stations in the hinterland.

SOCIAL SERVICES

In the Western Aden Protectorate the development of schools is fostered by the political staff in close consultation with the Colony Education Department.

The only school directly administered by the Aden Education Department is the Aden Protectorate College for the Sons of Chiefs, a primary boarding school of limited size, in Aden.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate, in some departments notably in education and customs administration, there has been much progress. An Educational Assistant to the Resident Adviser, seconded from the Sudan, assists the Mukalla Government in educational matters. There are now over 20 primary schools and an intermediate boarding school for about 100 pupils. Several scholarships have been awarded to promising students to complete their education in the Sudan.

A Protectorate Education Officer was appointed in November, 1944.

The Government of Aden, in co-operation with the Church of Scotland Mission, has introduced a medical scheme in the Western Aden Protectorate which covers 12 tribal areas and employs 23 dispensers who work in 16 separate dispensaries.

TRADE, INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE

Trade in the Western Aden Protectorate is chiefly confined to transit trade from the Yemen, from which coffee and skins are exported, but no reliable figures are available. The only industries are weaving, dyeing and charcoal-burning though some silver work is made by the few small village Jewish communities. Some 10,000 camels bring vegetables, eggs, fodder and cattle for sale in Aden every month.

Imports into the Western Aden Protectorate include kerosene, soap, ginger, tobacco, rice, flour, tea, sugar and assorted cloths, etc.

Agriculture is the chief occupation of the majority of the tribesmen of the Western Aden Protectorate. Every possible use is made of irrigation and water rights are a frequent cause of tribal feuds.

The staple crops are corn (dhurra), bulrush millet (dukhn) and some Indian corn. Wheat and barley are found at the higher altitude; other crops are sesame and lucerne: some cotton and local indigo (hawir) is also grown. Dates are grown in some areas and coffee in Yafa’. Bananas, papayas, apricots and peaches are found in the ‘Abdali and ‘Audhali sultanates. Honey is found in small quantities in two or three areas.

PUBLIC REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE

As local administrations have but recently been set up it is not yet possible to estimate the revenues of the states in the Western Aden Protectorate.

In the Eastern Aden Protectorate the revenue of the Qu’aiti Government may be roughly estimated at 16 lakhs and expenditure at 13 lakhs of rupees. The principal sources of revenue are customs and excise and licence dues but the introductions of land and date palm taxation will provide another fruitful source. The finances of the other sultanates have not yet been stabilised. Two lakhs are spent on police and armed constabulary, two lakhs on education, 3½ lakhs on the army and 3½ lakhs on public works.

BAHAMA ISLANDS

Situation and Area

The Bahamas are an archipelago of islands, cays and rocks lying between 20° 50' and 27° 25' N. latitude and 72° 37' and 80° 32' W. longitude, and extending from Inagua on the south to Matanilla Reef on the north; from Mayaguana and its adjacent rocks and cays on the east to, and including, the Cay Sal Bank on the west, and separated from Florida, to the west, by the Straits of Florida, and from Cuba, to the south, by the old Bahama and Nicholas Channels.

The total area of the colony is 4,375½ square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

Climate

The winter climate is salubrious and most delightful, frost is unknown, the average temperature is 70° F., the rainfall is slight and cool breezes prevail. During the summer months the greatest heat ranges from 80° F. to 90° F., and though the islands are never unhealthy, the change in temperature throughout the 24 hours is so small that those who remain in the colony for the whole year may find the long summer somewhat enervating.

The rainfall for the year 1946 amounted to 50·35 inches. Relative humidity for the year was 84°.

The islands are sometimes visited in the autumn months by hurricanes which cause considerable damage to crops and buildings and occasionally loss of life.

General Description

The colony consists of about 700 islands, of which only 20 are inhabited, and over 2,000 rocks. The islands are, generally, long, narrow and low lying, and the ground is rocky, but the coral rocks contain pockets of rich fertile soil. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, the Biminis, Watling's Island (or San Salvador), Grand Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklins Island, Mayaguana, Andros Island and the Berry Islands.

The majority of the inhabitants is of the negro race, about one-sixth is of European descent. English is universally spoken.

The islands are of coralline formation and contain no mineral wealth. They are sub-tropical and both temperate and tropical trees exist, the pine tree and the palm growing literally side by side. It is probable that at one time all the islands were thickly wooded but little forest now remains except on Abaco, Andros and Grand Bahama, where there are extensive pine forests.

The soil, except in small pockets, is usually shallow and overlaid hard coral rock and is on the whole suitable only for peasant farming.

Nassau, the capital of the colony, is the centre of the tourist traffic, which is of paramount importance in the economic life of the colony. It has a pipe-borne water supply and an up-to-date sewerage system, an ice plant, electric light and automatic telephone systems, a broadcasting station and overseas telephone service.

There are excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists, who visit the colony from the United States and Canada during the winter months. The tourists are attracted by the ideal climate, the clear water and white beaches, the beautiful colouring of the sea and sky, and opportunities afforded for swimming, fishing, boating, etc.

Fish abound in the waters of the colony, and Bimini, which is a centre for sports fishing, is visited by numbers of fishing enthusiasts from the United States.

History

San Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had any settlements on any of the islands of this group at any time. Early in the 17th century the islands were well known to the settlers of Bermuda and the Carolinas. They were included in the Royal Grant of Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney-General of England, of the 30th of October, 1629. By 1640 the islands had become a well-known place of resort by the inhabitants of Bermuda, and on the 9th of July, 1647, The Company of Eleutherian Adventurers was formed in London for the purpose of making an organised attempt at a systematic colonisation and development of the islands. William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, was the moving spirit of this venture, and associated with him were a number of influential city merchants and members of Parliament. On the 31st of August, 1649, Parliament, on the petition of Sayle and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands," which constituted Sayle and his associates the proprietors of the islands. Notwithstanding the Royal Grant to Heath in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles the Second, on the 1st of November, 1670, granted the islands to six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, namely, the Duke of Albermarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Berkeley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret and Sir Peter Colleton. Before the Royal Grant of 1670 the inhabitants of the islands had organised the settlement and instituted a form of government which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected Captain John Wentworth as their Governor. Wentworth applied to and received commissions from the Governors of Jamaica. The Lords Proprietors appointed Hugh Wentworth as their first Governor on 24th April, 1671, but he did not take up the appointment. They then confirmed in office John Wentworth, the popularly elected Governor, on the 26th of December, 1671. A regular system of government was established including a parliament, the lower house of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the civil and military government of the islands was resumed by the Crown on the surrender of their rights by the Lords Proprietors on the 28th October, 1717. Thirteen proprietary governors were appointed between 1671 and 1715. The settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the settlement was reformed by their return, principally from Jamaica, under the leadership of Thomas Bridges. Bridges was recognised as Governor by the Lords Proprietors on the 12th July, 1688, and the settlement had reached some importance when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards in 1703. However, a year or so after this the
dispersed inhabitants returned to New Providence and another proprietary governor was appointed in 1707. But the islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the civil and military government of the place, and thus accede to the numerous petitions which the inhabitants had been making for several years and also carry out the express wishes of Parliament. Since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The islands were surrendered to a fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but they had been retaken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux before the conclusion of the war, which was brought to an end by the Peace of Versailles, 1783, when the British possession was confirmed.

After the American Revolution a number of loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas Group and received substantial assistance from England, and on the 19th of March, 1787, the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000, which was provided by Parliament.

The Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, and which had often in their early history been claimed both by Bermuda and the Bahamas, were separated from the other Bahamas in 1848, and formed into a distinct presidency, under the government-in-chief of Jamaica.

CONSTITUTION

The present constitution of the Bahamas is similar to those of the North American colonies prior to the War of Independence. The government is modelled upon that of England in the early days, the Governor representing the Sovereign, and the nominated Legislative Council and the elected Houses of Assembly representing respectively the Houses of Lords and Commons.

"The Eleutherian Adventurers," who came to the Bahamas from Bermuda after the Parliamentary grant of 1647, brought with them a conception of representative government already established in Bermuda, and the affairs of the infant settlement were managed by a Governor, a Council and an elected Senate. The Charter of 1670 to the Lords Proprietors provided for an elected House of Assembly, and the Constitution, much as it exists today, was finally settled in 1729, when the Crown assumed direct control of the colony. The Bahamas enjoy representative, though not responsible, government. The executive government is in the hands of a Governor, appointed by the Crown, who has the power of veto, and is advised by an Executive Council. Various executive powers and the right to enact certain subsidiary legislation are vested by law in the Governor in Council.

The Legislative Council, consisting of nine members nominated by the Crown, was created as a separate Council by Royal Letters Patent in 1841.

The House of Assembly is composed of 29 members elected for 15 districts. The qualification for members is possession of real or personal property to the value of £200. The Out Islands seldom return a member of their own community, their 21 representatives being generally inhabitants of New Providence. The qualification for electors is ownership of land to the value of £5 or the occupation of houses of annual rental value of £2 8s., in New Providence, or half that amount in the Out Islands. Women have not the vote. The normal life of the House is seven years, but it may be dissolved at any time by the Governor, as occurred in June, 1928, and in May, 1935. No forms of local government exist.

POPULATION

The estimated population on 31st December, 1946, was 80,639, made up of 39,721 males and 40,918 females.

53,735 (census 1901), 55,944 (census 1911), 55,481 (census 1921), 59,828 (census 1931), 68,846 (census 1943). New Providence contains 29,391 inhabitants according to the 1943 census.

The following table shows the area and population of each of the principal islands of the colony according to the last census taken on 25th April, 1943:

Total: 4,403‡ 32,124 36,722 68,846
ADMINISTRATION

The executive government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor aided by an Executive Council not exceeding nine members. In the absence of the Governor the senior member of the Executive Council administers the government.

In addition to the usual government departments in New Providence there are public boards dealing with public works, education, health, pilotage, agricultural and marine products, electrical, development, telephones, prisons, industrial school, licensing (liquor and shops) and libraries, which are appointed annually by the Governor, consisting of five members, two of whom are required to be members of the House of Assembly. These boards determine the policy and control the expenditure of the departments concerned, but the work is carried out under the supervision and direction of the head of the department.

In the Out Islands the commissioners administer their respective districts; and annual boards of works and health under their chairmanship are appointed by the Governor.

RELIGION

There is no state religion, the Church of England having been disestablished in 1869. The religions with the largest number of followers are the Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists and Roman Catholics.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The legal tender currency is British sterling, although United States currency is also generally accepted in the colony. Currency notes of the denominations of 4s., 10s., £1 and £5 are issued by the Bahamas Government through the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada. A total amount of £482,800 of these notes was in circulation on 31st December, 1946. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is a branch bank of the Royal Bank of Canada in Nassau (New Providence).

A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1946, deposited £320,707.

COMMUNICATIONS

The following are the rates of postage:

| Letters. | Newspapers. |
|----------|------------|
| U.K., British Empire— | 1d. per 2 oz. |
| 2½d. first oz. | or part. |
| 1d. for each subsequent oz. | Bahamas |
| Bahamas— | New Providence, 1d. per free. |
| 1¼d. per 2 oz. or part. | 2 oz. |

| 5 lb. | 8d. |
| 6 to 12 lb. | 1s. |
| 12 to 22 lb. | 1s. 6d. |

Parcel post with the United Kingdom (9d. per lb. via New York, 1s. 3d. per lb. via Miami), the United States (9d. per lb.), *Canada (6d. per lb. to 10 lb., 10 to 15 lb. 6s. per parcel, 15 to 20 lb., 8s. per parcel), *Bermuda (6d. per lb.), and *Jamaica (6d. per lb.), has been established, and money order agreements have been made with the United States, Canada and Jamaica.

Radio Telephone and Telegraph

During 1946 the radio telegraph circuit to Miami was modernised by the introduction of frequency shift radio teleprinter operation between Nassau and Miami. This system permits high-speed automatic transmission and reception by direct teleprinter machines with automatic retransmission at Miami into the Western Union System of the United States.

A marine radio telephone service was introduced providing radio telephone communication over a range of 300 miles enabling vessels suitably equipped to communicate direct into the automatic telephone system of Nassau. Other similar installations have been provided on the islands of Cat Cay and Inagua, thus giving coverage to the whole of the area of the Bahama Islands for private vessels, coastal service vessels and ocean-going liners.

With the conversion of Oakes Field from a military to a civil airport, telecommunications facilities have been provided for airline companies and passengers.

The radio telephone system to the Out Islands has been extended and improved, and plans are being prepared for further extension.

Numerous telecommunications facilities have been provided for oil companies in connection with the oil survey developments.

The radio telephone circuit to Miami was extended for operation during the winter season, and plans have been prepared for the introduction of a second circuit.

Broadcasting

At a Broadcasting Conference in Washington in February the classification of the broadcasting station and the frequency of operation were altered. The frequency of 640 kcs., which had been previously shared with a station at Los Angeles, had to be relinquished in favour of the frequency of 1,540 kcs., in view of the claims to the use of 640 kcs. by a Cuban broadcasting station. At the same time the Nassau broadcasting station, which had previously been recognised as adherent to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, was granted the classification of a Class 1-A clear channel dominant station on the new frequency of 1,540 kcs., and in accordance with the engineering limits laid down under the Agreement must receive protection from interference according to the North American Regional Broadcasting standards. The change to the new frequency was carried out in June, and operation has proved to be satisfactory. The Bahamas is now signatory to the North American Regional Agreement, and, as such, is entitled to consideration in any future discussions regarding the use of radio frequencies in the standard broadcast band.

* The rate of 6d. per lb. is applicable only if parcels can be sent by direct sea route, otherwise the rate is 6d. per lb. plus onward charges of the United States Post Office.
This is a considerable improvement over the previous conditions under which the station operated and gives the Colony the recognition which it should have in view of its proximity to the United States and other countries signatory to the North American Regional Agreement.

A further North American Regional Broadcasting Conference is to be held in Canada in 1948, at which the allocation of frequencies in the North American region will again be reviewed.

Air and Shipping

With the exception of an irregular service between Nassau and Miami by small local motor vessels, and an occasional freighter from England and Canada, all steamship service to the colony was discontinued as a result of the war.

Negotiations are now under way for the re-establishment of freight and passenger services between Bahamas and England, Canada and the United States on a schedule basis.

Pan American World Airways operated a mail, passenger and express service between Miami and Nassau six days a week up to November, 1945, and a daily service from then on with two or more planes per day from 1st December. In February, 1946, they have operated as many as six planes per day.

* Social Services

Health.—The medical and public health service is administered by a Health Board.

The medical needs of the colony in New Providence are met by the Bahamas General Hospital, which has a full time resident staff of three doctors, a European matron, three European sisters and a number of native nurses.

The service of the hospital is furnished largely free of charge. There is an outpatient department, a general hospital, a lunatic asylum, infirmary, dental clinic, venereal and gynaecological clinic. There are X-ray and bacteriological laboratories.

In addition to the medical service afforded by the Bahamas General Hospital there are eight private medical practitioners in New Providence.

Education.—There is a government system of elementary education, established in 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1885, and Consolidating Act of 1908. Attendance is compulsory from 6 to 14 years of age. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.

There are 75 unsectarian government schools and 46 aided schools, with 12,276 scholars. In addition, there are 44 denominational schools with a total roll of over 2,268 pupils and private schools with over 255 pupils.

The government elementary schools were made free in 1885. Higher education is provided at Queen’s College, St. Francis Xavier’s Academy, the Government High School, and St. Augustine’s Boys School, all in Nassau.

Labour Service.—There is a Labour Officer appointed by the Governor whose chief functions have, up to the present, been the registering of unemployed and the recruitment of agricultural labourers for work in the United States.

There is a standing Labour Board appointed by the Governor for the purpose of advising on any question arising regarding wages.

Legislation affecting trade unions and workmen’s compensation was passed in 1943. So far the only trade union is the Bahamas Trades and Labour Union.
