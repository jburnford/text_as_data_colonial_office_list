BARBADOS

SITUATION AND AREA
Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' N. and longitude 59° 37' W., and is the most easterly of the Caribbean Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

CLIMATE
Owing to the easterly trade winds which blow almost continuously from December to June the climate is bracing and the heat is never oppressive. During the remainder of the year, the wet season for the island, the heat is seldom excessive although the absence of the trade winds renders the climate less invigorating. The average temperature is 79·8° F.

Though the island is small there is considerable variation in rainfall: in the high central areas the average rainfall is 75 inches while in some of the low lying districts in the south of the island it is no more than 50 inches.

The island is largely visited as a health resort by residents of neighbouring West Indian colonies and British Guiana and is a popular winter resort for visitors from temperate climates. It is also a port of call for tourist steamers.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The land rises in terraces from the coast to a ridge near the centre of the island, the highest point being Mt. Hillaby (1,100 feet). The main characteristic of the island is the intense sugar cultivation; all available land is utilised and, due to the almost complete absence of forest and waste land, the general appearance is reminiscent of the English countryside. In the north-west—the Scotland district—the watershed is nearer to the coast and the descent to the sea is consequently steeper. The scenery, too, is more rugged and picturesque, and there is some erosion.

With the exception of the Scotland district, which is of volcanic origin, the island is of coral formation. Coral limestone covers the greater part of the island and coral reefs, which in some parts extend more than two miles out to sea, almost encircle it. The soils overlying the coral limestone, although divided into several types, are all suitable for good sugar cane cultivation, though heavy application of artificial manures is necessary to maintain fertility.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the south-west of the island on Carlisle Bay. This bay is an open roadstead sheltered from the prevailing winds and is available for all classes of vessels. There is in addition an inner harbour or careenage where schooners and vessels of lighter tonnage are moored.

The island is fortunate in having excellent bathing, though on the windward coast the sea is apt to be rough.

HISTORY

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who found it uninhabited and rude in appearance, and named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig trees. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive Blossom in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbadoes, and the party, which consisted of some 30 persons, landed on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their Governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Caribbean Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of £300. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 64 settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in the possession of Great Britain.

CONSTITUTION

The colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Secretary of State for the Colonies retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is nominated by the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of the Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of 10 members appointed by His Majesty, and a House of Assembly, consisting of 24 members (two for each parish and two for the City of Bridgetown) elected for a period of two years. In 1944 the income qualification for voters was reduced from £50 to £20 a year, and the franchise was given to females, who also became eligible for election as members. The number of registered electors in 1945 was 15,846 as compared with 7,394 in 1943. The executive part of the Government is vested in the Governor and an Executive Council and, in respect of certain matters, an Executive Committee. The Executive Council consists of the Colonial Secretary and Attorney General ex officio, and of such other persons as His Majesty may appoint. The Executive Committee, which is created by local statute, consists of the Executive Council ex officio and of one member of the Legislative Council and four members of the House of Assembly appointed by the Governor at the commencement of each session of the Legislature. The Executive Committee introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates and initiates all Government measures; it is also responsible for the conduct of public works, and the control and management of Government property. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada and Tobago, but in 1885, by Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands and made a distinct Government.

POPULATION

The population of the island in 1851 was 135,939. Thereafter a census was taken in every tenth year, except 1901, until 1921. There was no census in 1931 or 1941 but there was one in 1946. The population increased steadily between 1851 and 1891 in which year it was returned as 182,306. In 1911 the census figure was 171,983, in 1921 it was 156,512 and in 1946, 192,841. This increase is attributable to cessation of emigration to America, Cuba and Panama in the
early twenties, decrease in the death rate and continued high birth rate.

The population consists of persons of African descent, persons of European descent and persons of mixed African and European descent. In 1921 persons of European descent represented 6·7 per cent. of the population; the percentage today is probably smaller.

English is spoken universally.

**Administration**

The island is administered as one unit except in respect of local government matters, which are in the hands of the vestries and parochial boards of the 11 parishes. The vestries are elected annually, and each vestry appoints commissioners of highways, commissioners of health and poor law guardians for the parish. The two last-named bodies rely for revenue upon grants from the vestry, but the commissioners of highways, who are responsible for the upkeep of all public highways in the parish which are not maintained by the Central Government, collect all vehicle and highway taxes and in addition receive grants-in-aid from the Central Government. The vestries derive their revenue mainly from taxes on ownership and occupancy of land and houses and trade tax; the rates for these are fixed annually so as to bring in sufficient revenue to meet the estimated expenditure for the year. The vestries undertake the repair and maintenance of churches and church buildings and the rector of each parish is chairman of the vestry *ex officio*.

**Religion**

The population is almost wholly Christian, and the Anglican Church, the membership of which comprises approximately 70 per cent. of the population, is the established church. The Anglican clergy receive their salaries from Government funds and are eligible for pensions under the Pension Act. The maintenance and repair of churches and church property is the responsibility of the vestries, which are authorised to lay rates for the purpose.

Next in size after the Anglican Church are the Methodist and Moravian Churches, both of which have been long established in the island. The number of Roman Catholics is comparatively small. In addition to these there are branches of the Salvation Army and of many denominations of modern growth.

**Currency and Banking**

Government accounts, with the exception of the Savings Bank, are kept in sterling; commercial accounts in West Indian dollars (£1 = $4·80). Currency notes issued by the Government in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $20 and $100 are legal tender, as also are notes issued by the Governments of British Guiana and Trinidad. There is no local issue of coin, but United Kingdom coin is used, silver being legal tender in any amount.

There are three banks doing business in Barbados:

- Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), paid up capital, £4,975,500.
- Royal Bank of Canada, paid up capital, $35,000,000.
- Canadian Bank of Commerce, paid up capital, $30,000,000.

There is also a Government Savings Bank. On the 31st December, 1946, the bank had 35,615 depositors and the total amount at credit of depositors was $9,916,484·62 or £2,065,934.

**Communications**

**Air**

There is a landing ground with a 5,000 feet hard surfaced runway at Seawell in the south-eastern part of the island. British West Indian Airways, Ltd., provides regular air services to Trinidad, British Guiana and Jamaica and to most of the Windward and Leeward Islands.

**Sea**

Regular steamship services were disrupted as a result of the war and have not yet been resumed. The principal lines operating at the end of 1946 were the Harrison Line to the United Kingdom and the Alcoa Line and Canadian National Steamships to North America. Barbados is the headquarters of the schooner trade in the Eastern Caribbean.

**Roads and Road Transport**

The office of Director of Highways and Transport was created in 1945 and the Director was made responsible for the duties hitherto performed by two statutory boards—the Central Road Board and the Transport Board. He is assisted by an advisory committee of four members appointed by the Governor.

There are 545 miles of road open for traffic; 293 miles are maintained by the Director of Highways and Transport and the remainder by the parochial authorities.

The Director also exercises a general control over public service vehicles, and in particular over omnibuses, which may operate only on such routes and in accordance with such time tables as he approves.

**Telecommunications**

External telecommunication services are operated by:

1. Cable and Wireless (West Indies), Limited, controlled by Cable and Wireless, Limited. This company owns and operates cable connections with most of the other more important West Indian Islands and British Guiana (all covered by alternative wireless telegraphy links for use when necessary) and through Turks Island and Bermuda to Halifax, where connection is made with the company's North Atlantic cable system to Great Britain and other parts of the world.

The company has also established in the island large long-range wireless installations which, with its previously established wireless coast station, are operated in conjunction with the cable system and provide services with many parts of the world and with a number of the other West Indian Islands which are not connected by cable. The coast station also provides a service with ships at sea.

In 1945 the company, in collaboration with the Barbados Telephone Company, Limited, inaugurated wireless telephone services. U.K., Canada, the U.S.A., Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, British Guiana, Trinidad, Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat, Grenada, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent are covered; also services with Dutch West Indies, Tobago, etc., and extension of the U.K. service to the continent of Europe are being added.

2. The Western Telegraph Company, Limited, also controlled by Cable and Wireless, Limited, with direct cable communication with Brazil and South America generally.

3. The Western Union Telegraph Company, with cable connection to Miami, operated in conjunction with the Western Telegraph Company, Limited.
The principal tariffs are:

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education.**

In 1943 the direction of education was transferred from a statutory board to a Director of Education. The latter has an Advisory Board of five members appointed by the Governor.

Though there is not compulsory education, any child between the ages of 5 and 14 may attend a public elementary school free of charge. There are 126 such schools, staffed by Government teachers; at the end of March, 1947, there were 28,880 children on the roll (14,557 boys and 14,323 girls) and the average attendance was 21,376.

Secondary education is provided in all state-aided schools and in a few private schools. The state-aided secondary schools receive annual grants from the Government and are managed by governing bodies, the powers and duties of which are defined in schemes framed by the
Director of Education and approved by the Legislature. The schools are divided into three first grade schools (two boys' and one girls') and eight second grade schools (four boys', three girls' and one co-educational). The former prepare candidates for the school certificate and higher certificate, the latter only for the school certificate. The only secondary schools with boarding accommodation are the Lodge School, one of the first grade boys' schools, and Codrington High School, a private girls' school.

Codrington College, founded under the will of Sir Christopher Codrington at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was affiliated to Durham University in 1875 and awards the degree of the University. It is under the administration of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, who are the trustees of the founder's will. In 1946 there were 27 undergraduates in residence. All were studying either classics or theology.

The Government spends over £200,000 per annum on education. This includes one scholarship awarded annually, and tenable for at least three years at Oxford or Cambridge University; two scholarships annually at Codrington College, and one scholarship offered biennially and two exhibitions entailing the remission of fees at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture in Trinidad.

Health

Public health administration is the responsibility of the General Board of Health and of the Commissioners of Health of the 11 parishes. The Government Chief Medical Officer is a member ex officio of the General Board of Health, which has a general power to make rules and regulations for promoting the health of the inhabitants of the island, but has no direct control over the parochial Commissioners of Health. Each parish maintains its own almshouse and employs a parochial medical officer.

The only general hospital is the Barbados General Hospital, which has accommodation for 30 paying patients and 256 non-paying patients. The hospital is administered by a statutory board, most of the members of which are appointed by the Legislature. The hospital receives an annual grant from the Government based on its estimated expenditure.

The Government maintains a mental hospital (accommodation for 248 males and 326 females) and a leper hospital, of which the number of inmates at the end of 1946 was 44.

Recently, however, the Legislature has passed an Act establishing a Department of Medical Services with a Director of Medical Services at its head. Under the terms of the Act the Director shall be responsible for all matters affecting the public health and medical services of the island, and shall have general superintendence and direction of the public services of the island and of such Government institutions and establishments as the Governor may from time to time direct. The Director shall also visit and inspect all infirmaries, homes, almshouses and hospital in the island. This Act will come into effect on such day as His Excellency the Governor may appoint.

The Legislature also has under consideration at present a Bill to constitute the Barbados General Hospital a Government institution subject to the general superintendence and direction of the Director of Medical Services.

Labour

The Labour Department was established in 1940. The principles of collective bargaining introduced with the establishment of the Department continued to be instrumental in bringing about improved relations in industry.

Organisation among employers and employees made notable strides since the passage of the Trade Union Act, 1939, and most of the six trade unions registered between the years 1941-45 have been functioning with success. The Barbados Workers' Union, the largest employees' organisation, now has an active membership of over 12,000 covering 26 divisions, and has its counterpart in the Shipping and Mercantile Association of Barbados, which comprises the principal business concerns of the city. During 1946, 13 agreements affecting the wages and conditions of workers were signed between these two organisations in respect of different categories of workers. The Sugar Producers' Federation, an employers' organisation embracing the principal sugar factories and estates of the Island, rendered considerable assistance in bringing about improvement in the wages and working conditions of those employed in sugar factories. The Clerks' Union has within the past year been negotiating direct with employers and doing valuable work in obtaining better wages. The Congress Trade Union also representative of a number of categories of workers continued to extend its activities and to consolidate its position. The Overseers' Association, comprising the junior staff of those engaged in the management of sugar factories, has not been particularly active during the past year. The Bus Owners' Association registered in April, 1947, now makes a total of seven organisations registered under the Trade Union Act.

The last eight years have seen the enactment of considerable legislation relating to labour; among the more important measures are acts dealing with the recruiting of workers, trade disputes, trade unions, workmen's compensation, wages boards and the hours and conditions of employment of shop assistants.

Between June, 1941, and December, 1946, 14,670 workers left the colony on temporary emigration schemes sponsored by the labour department; the majority went to the U.S.A. to work in industry and agriculture, and the amounts which they saved from their earnings have improved the social and economic condition of a large number of families. The return of U.S.A. nationals to American industry did away with the pressing need for immigrant workers and this, together with the discharge of men from the armed forces, aggravated the local unemployment position which at the end of 1946 was again beginning to give cause for concern.

Social Welfare

In 1943 the Government created the posts of Social Welfare Officer and Assistant Social Welfare Officer. In the same year Barbados Welfare Limited was incorporated and registered as a non-profit making company, its object being to help groups of people to co-operate in raising their standard of living by economic, cultural and recreational activities. The Social Welfare Officer is a member of the board of directors. The company has directed its activities to assistance in the provision of playing fields, the development of cottage industries and other minor industries on a co-operative basis, and the promotion of youth organisations. A subsidiary company has
been formed to manufacture salt on a co-operative basis; progress has been made in the formation of clubs and women's institutes, and the provision of playing fields, and organisers are employed to teach cottage handicrafts and to organise co-operative community efforts.

There are also a number of other voluntary bodies working in the social welfare field.

(Note.—Further particulars of these services will be found in the Annual Departmental Reports.)
