TRINIDAD

SITUATION AND AREA

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 60° 55' and 61° 56' W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is 50 miles, its average breadth 37 miles, and its area 1,862 square miles. It is separated from S. America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, and Venezuela is only seven miles. The island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands) was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order-in-Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st January, 1889.

CLIMATE

The climate of Trinidad is tropical and may be divided into two seasons, a dry season from January to the middle of May, with an average rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per month, and a wet season from June to December, with an average of 8 inches per month. The coolest months of the year are December to April. The average temperature during the day is 84 and during the night 74. The average yearly rainfall is 70 inches. The climate is healthy and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided reasonable precautions are taken.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguanas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising to 3,085 feet; the central range runs south-west from Manzilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar, cacao and coconuts, which are its staples.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain, situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria.

HISTORY

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Roume de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 Trinidad was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

In accordance with the terms of the Bases Agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America which was signed on 27th March, 1941, certain areas have been leased to the United States for 99 years and have been occupied and developed as naval or army air bases.

CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION

The government is administered by a Governor with an Executive Council consisting at present of eight members. Of the latter, the persons holding the offices of Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Financial Secretary are ex-officio members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago. It now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, six nominated unofficial members and nine elected members. Trinidad is divided into eight electoral districts, each returning one member. Tobago forms the ninth electoral district and returns one member.

POPULATION

The population of Trinidad and Tobago on 31st December, 1946, was estimated to be 568,619.

The population of the principal towns at 31st December, 1946, was estimated to be:

- Port of Spain: 94,564

**Railways and Roads**

The railway system consists of a total length of 118 miles, of which the first line opened in 1897 runs from Port of Spain to Arima and Sangre Grande along the southern foothills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the coast, the length of the line being 29 miles.

The line to San Fernando and Siparia, 44 miles long, leaves the former at St. Joseph Junction. The first section to Couva was opened in 1880, extended to San Fernando in 1882, and the further extension to Siparia was opened in 1913.

The Caparo Valley line from Jerningham Junction to Rio Claro, 28½ miles long, was opened to Tabaquite in 1898 and extended to Rio Claro in 1914.

TOBAGO

SITUATION AND AREA

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. latitude and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. longitude, distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 7½ miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 116 square miles, or 74,392 acres, of which about 42,000 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Tobago is a ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, livestock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1946 was $1,211,383, made up as follows:

| Product          | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| Cocoa            | $232,935|
| Coconuts and coconut fibre | $57,616 |
| Copra            | $664,286|
| Other products   | $256,546|

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about eight miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

**History**

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Captain Keymis in the "Darling" and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zeelanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1634, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras to evacuate the island, the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefrey and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commodore Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

**Constitution**

The government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order-in-Council of 7th February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order-in-Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united colony, who was *ex officio* a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order-in-Council of 20th October, 1898, the Order-in-Council of 17th November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future ordinances of the legislature of the colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the legislature should be able to enact special and local ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the colony.

This Order-in-Council was brought into effect from 1st January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on 8th December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.

**Population**

| Census | Male | Female | Total |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| 1901   | 8,671| 10,080 | 18,751|
| 1911   | 9,922| 10,827 | 20,749|

| 1946   |      |        | 27,208|

Scarborough has a population, according to the census of 1931, of 833.

**Communications**

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a coastal steamer service, provided by the Government, also by an air service provided by the British West Indian Airways, Ltd.

The island possesses a fair mileage of motor roads and is served by the railway omnibuses with daily services to all districts. Connecting omnibuses are provided in conjunction with the coastal steamers.

**Education**

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian and Methodist bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.
