NORTH BORNEO*

Situation and Area

North Borneo, including Labuan, lies between 7° N. and 4° N. and between 115° E. and 120° E. It has an area of 29,540 square miles, the greatest length on the mainland being 200 miles, its greatest breadth 220 miles. The greatest length of Labuan is 11 miles, its greatest breadth, 6 miles.

Climate

North Borneo is favoured by a relatively cool climate for a place situated so near the equator. The average mean temperatures are as follows:

| Location     | Maximum | Minimum |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Jesselton    | 88° F.  | 72° F.  |
| Sandakan     | 88°     | 75°     |
| Tambunan (situated in the high land in the interior) | 86°     | 66°     |

The annual rainfall varies from 60 to 180 inches according to locality. Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively drier belts. The wet season extends from October to February but the rain is not incessant, and during the wettest month there are intervals in which no rain falls and the ground dries rapidly. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and continues to the middle of April. The south-west monsoon lasts from April till October. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt. The wind is usually light during the south-west monsoon but short squalls are common in the afternoons and evenings.

General Description

North Borneo occupies the northern part of Borneo, the third largest island in the world, and is bordered on the south-west by Sarawak, and on the south-east by Dutch Borneo. The interior of the territory is mountainous, culminating in Mount Kinabalu, which is 13,453 feet high, and is the highest mountain in the East Indies. Most of the colony is densely timbered. On the west coast there is a narrow coastal plain which supports the main agricultural and rubber productions of the colony.

The main towns are situated on the coast. These are Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawau. Jesselton is now the capital of the colony. All these towns have good harbours.

Labuan, which now forms part of the colony, is a small island lying three miles off the mainland commanding the Bay of Brunei, and consisting of low undulating land. Victoria is the only town of any size, and it has a small but well-sheltered harbour.

History

Early in the sixteenth century, the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei, North Borneo and Labuan. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion of an unenlightened character reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued, and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. British and American traders endeavoured to get a firm footing in North Borneo, but it was not until 1872 that the Sultan of Brunei ceded a large area to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory, and was made in perpetuity. In November, 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Company which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo Chartered Company.

This Company governed British North Borneo until January, 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September, 1945, and was under military administration until 15th July, 1946, when it became part of the new crown colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new colony of North Borneo.

* The Malayan Union (now the Federation of Malaya), Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak, with the Protected State of Brunei were placed in May, 1946, in the sphere of authority of a Governor-General (Rt. Hon. Malcolm MacDonald), appointed to ensure the coordination of policy and administration throughout these territories. In May, 1948, Mr. MacDonald assumed in addition the functions previously discharged by the Special Commissioner in South East Asia (Lord Killearn) with the title of Commissioner-General. His former functions are not affected by the amalgamation."
Borneo on the same date. The island was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Brunei in 1846 as a place where H.M. ships might careen and refit, and, after being administered as a separate colony for many years, was eventually incorporated in the Straits Settlements in 1907, becoming a separate settlement in 1912.

CONSTITUTION

The constitution is regulated by letters patent, dated 10th July, 1946, under which a governor and commander-in-chief of the colony is appointed. Under this instrument full sovereign rights are assumed over British North Borneo, following the North Borneo Cession Order-in-Council dated 10th July, 1946, under which the British North Borneo Company ceded all its rights. Under the Labuan Order-in-Council dated 10th July, 1946, Labuan ceased to be a part of the Straits Settlements, and became part of the colony of North Borneo.

Under the letters patent as amended and defined by the royal instructions dated 10th July, there is an Advisory Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary and 18 appointed members of whom are the three Residents, the Protector of Labour, the Conservator of Forests, three European, four Chinese and six Malay unofficials. There is also an Executive Committee consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, the Resident West Coast, the Protector of Labour, one European, two Chinese and one Malay unofficials.

POPULATION

The population of the mainland was 270,223 in 1931, which was the year in which the last census was held. A fairly accurate population figure for 1946 can be obtained from the number of food ration cards issued, which puts the present population at 312,374.

The native population in 1931 was 209,218, of whom 117,482 were Dusuns who are an agricultural community. Bajaus and Bruneis (fishing people), Muruts (pagan inland tribes), and Suluks (migratory coastal people) form the remainder of the native population. The Chinese, who handle most of the commercial trade and are responsible for a considerable amount of rubber planting and vegetable gardening, numbered 47,799 in 1931. There has been a considerable increase since that date. The total population in 1891 was only 67,062 so that it has been more than quadrupled during the chartered company's rule.

Labuan had a population of 8,963 in 1941, consisting mainly of Malays and Chinese, and in 1946 was in the region of 9,253, which was the number of food ration cards issued.

ADMINISTRATION

For administrative purposes the colony is divided into Residences: East Coast, West Coast and Labuan and Interior.

There are five District Offices in the East Coast Residency, four in the West Coast, and five in the Labuan and Interior Residency. Within the districts headmen of the villages carry on minor administration under native chiefs. These chiefs preside over the native courts which deal with offences against native customs. They also collect poll tax. The courts held by district officers are concerned with normal civil actions, breaches of the laws of the colony, and crime. The chief justice is the only official whose work is solely judicial.

Townships are at present administered by sanitary boards whose revenue and expenditure form part of the general revenue and expenditure of the colony.

The territory is policed by the North Borneo armed constabulary, a quasi-military force established by the chartered company. The constabulary has an authorised strength of seven British officers, seven native officers and 706 other ranks.

RELIGION

The chief native races are Dusuns, Bajaus and Muruts. There are also appreciable numbers of immigrants from Brunei and the Philippines, and a considerable number of Chinese. Indians and Javanese are not numerous.

The Dusuns are the largest group, and although they are to be found anywhere in the colony they predominate on the west coast. They have their own language and do not speak Malay except for the relatively few who live in close contact with the populated centres on the coast. They are very largely pagan, though a small number have embraced Mohammedanism, and there are some Christians among them. The Bajaus are Malay-speaking and Mohammedan. The Muruts inhabit the interior; it was from among these that the head-hunters were found. They are a pagan race, and use a dialect of their own. There is a small group of Bruneis who live on the coastal plains near Brunei, having emigrated from that state. They are Malay-speaking and Mohammedan. Of the Chinese many are pagans, though there are an appreciable number of Christians among them. The Indians are almost all Sikhs, and are Hindus.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

Before the occupation the North Borneo Chartered Company issued its own notes, and these were circulated along with the notes issued by the Currency Commissioner of Malaya. After the liberation most of the Borneo Company's notes were redeemed by the military administration, though a few are still in circulation. The currency unit is the Straits dollar.

The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation have branches at Jesselton, Sandakan and Tawau. At Labuan, Messrs. Harrisons & Crosfield (Borneo), Ltd., act as their agents. The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Ltd., have branches at Jesselton and Sandakan.

COMMUNICATIONS

The west coast is served by the only railway in North Borneo. This a is metre gauge line running from Jesselton on the coast through Beaufort (57 miles) to Melalap in the interior, a distance of 96 miles. There is also a branch line from Beaufort to Weston (20 miles). This branch has no physical connection with the main line, being situated on the opposite side of the Padas River.
and passengers and goods are conveyed across by pontoon ferry. The road mileage in North Borneo is small. On the east coast there are 88 miles of metalled road outside municipal limits and 38 miles of earth roads, and on the west coast 46 miles of metalled roads and 60 miles of earth roads. The longest unbroken stretch of road is Jesselton to Tenghilan, a distance of 36 miles, most of which is now metalled. Labuan is well supplied with coral roads, but most of them were badly damaged by heavy vehicles during the war, and they require extensive repair. There is a network of bridle paths on the west coast and in the interior, approximating 600 miles, and suitable for pony transport. River transport is only possible by launch on the Kinabatangan and Segama Rivers on the east coast. The Straits Steamship Company maintains a steamship service between Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo approximately three times monthly. There is a weekly link by air with Kuching and Singapore operated by the R.A.F. using Sunderland flying boats. The urban areas are served by a telephone system and have radio communication with each other. There is a W/T link with Singapore and neighbouring territories.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Medical Facilities**

Hospitals are situated at Jesselton and Papar, supervised by the Medical Officer, Interior Residency, and at Labuan, Kudat, Sandakan and Tawau, where medical officers are stationed. There is also a hospital at Lahad Datu, which is supervised by the medical officer at Tawau.

Subordinate to each hospital are the dispensaries, of which there are 37. These are situated in the outlying districts and provide medical care and first-aid treatment to the smaller communities. They are staffed by senior dressers, who are under the supervision of the medical officer, and draw their supplies of drugs and other requirements through him.

A lunatic asylum is situated at Sandakan and all lunatics in the colony, with rare exceptions, are sent there for treatment. Inmates at present total 19.

The leper settlement is situated on Berhala Island and accommodates all lepers from the colony. There are at present 43 lepers in the settlement.

A health visitor is responsible for maternity and child welfare work. The supervision of the training and work of the native midwives is her responsibility. A midwives hostel is maintained, and after a hospital training and practical work in the districts under the health visitor, the pupils are returned to their villages and become village midwives.

**Education**

The missionary societies were the pioneers of education. In the year 1934 there were only eight Government vernacular schools, with an enrolment of 400, but the three missionary societies had 35 schools, with a total enrolment of 2,150.

The total school population has increased by some 4,000 children since the year 1946. The number of Government schools has increased from 32 pre-war to 60 in 1947. All are in the primary stage (six years) and are designed by suitable curricula to meet the needs of an agricultural community. It is proposed to open a Government trade school in 1948.

In accordance with the provisions of a five-year plan prepared for this department, it is proposed to introduce a number of reforms and improvements which will bring the educational system of the colony more into accord with modern colonial practice.

**Labour**

The Protectorate Department and Secretariat for Chinese Affairs is responsible for the inspection of conditions of labour in the colony, for the administration of the laws relating to labour, paupers, societies, female domestic service and protection of women and girls, and for the general supervision of Chinese immigration. A joint labour adviser for the three British Borneo territories of North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak has been appointed.

**Revenue and Expenditure**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1936 | $2,847,470 | $1,880,055 |
| 1937 | $3,485,270 | $1,904,102 |
| 1938 | $3,270,142 | $2,108,324 |
| 1939 | $3,527,522 | $2,254,539 |
| 1940 | $4,173,559 | $2,071,305 |
| 1946 (15th July to 31st December) | $1,818,300 | $2,019,600 |

The figures for 1941 had not been completed when the colony was occupied by the Japanese, and there are, of course, no figures for the intervening period until civil government resumed office on 15th July, 1946.

**Trade and Industry**

The main industries of the colony are the cultivation of rubber (126,649 acres), tobacco (11,065 acres), hemp (4,812 acres), coconuts and coconut products (53,029 acres), rice (90,195 acres), sago (14,023 acres). In the absence of later accurate statistical information these figures are taken from the 1938 returns and except for rice, which has decreased considerably, may be regarded as substantially correct. The manufacture of cutch, an extract of mangrove bark used in the tanning industry, was carried out. Pre-war and 2,988 tons were exported in 1940. Fishing gives employment to a large number of local natives and Chinese and 2,014 tons of dried and salt fish were exported in 1940. The main domestic animals in North Borneo are water buffaloes, ponies, cattle, pigs and goats. Some sheep existed before the war.

About nine-tenths of the territory is still heavily timbered and the exploitation of this was carried on pre-war on a considerable scale by several timber companies.

Owing to the loss of almost all records during the war there are gaps in the trade statistics of
the colony, but the following figures can be given for imports and exports:

| Year    | Imports   | Exports   |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1936    | $4,804,668| $8,985,766|
| 1937    | $6,361,939| $14,295,322|
| 1938    | $6,201,871| $9,525,773 |
| 1939    | $6,499,772| $13,453,491|
| 1940    | $9,978,000| $20,270,000|
| 1946 (July to December) | $8,155,886 | $4,009,356 |

The 1941 figures had not been completed when the colony was occupied by the Japanese, and no overseas trade was proceeding normally until the civil government took over from the military administration in July, 1946.
