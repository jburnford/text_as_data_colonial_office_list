**NORTHERN RHODESIA**

**SITUATION AND AREA**

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part of the territory formerly administered by the British South Africa Company, whose principal field of operations was defined in the Charter of Incorporation as "the region of South Africa lying immediately to the north of British Bechuanaland, and to the north and west of the South African Republic, and to the west of the Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa on the west.

The area of the territory is estimated at about 284,745 square miles.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into six provinces for fiscal and administrative purposes. The seat of government is at Lusaka, to which the principal departmental headquarters were moved from Livingstone in May, 1935. Other important settlements are at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Mazabuka, Ndola, near which the copper mines of Nchanga, Nkana, Roan Antelope and Mufulira are situated, Abercorn, Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu in Barotseland.
CLIMATE

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from May to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from 70° F. to 90° F. with a maximum of 103° F. and a minimum of 56° F. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from 55° F. to 75° F. with a maximum of 86° F. and a minimum of 40° F. In some parts the maximum temperature has reached the high figure of 120° F., whilst a minimum of 30° F. or less is not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from over 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 inches or less in the southern and south-eastern parts. On the average little or no rain falls during the period May to September. The month of October usually brings from about half an inch to two inches. The period, November to March, is the real wet season, during which anything from 70 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the total annual rainfall occurs. From April onwards the rains diminish again.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography, with elevations varying from 3,000 feet to 5,000 feet above sea level, but in the north-eastern districts the plateau rises to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. In many localities the evenness of the plateau is broken by hills, sometimes occurring as chains which develop into areas of broken country. The highest group of hills is the Machinga Mountains, which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet.

On the whole the territory is well wooded, even the crests of the highest hills bearing trees and orchard-like bush. Hundreds of square miles of country lie under tall grass along the Kafue in an area known as the Kafue Flats, in the Barotse plains near the Zambezi and also a large area south of Lake Bangweulu. These open grassy spaces for the most part contain swamps in which the water level fluctuates with the rainy seasons. The southern and central districts comprise areas where sparse bush alternates with grass lands in which farming and ranching have developed.

A glance at a large scale map suggests that the territory is well watered, but many of the smaller rivers shown have a seasonal flow and dry up after the rains. The larger rivers, the Zambezi, Kafue, Luangwa, the Chambeshi and the Luapula, together with their larger tributaries, have an all-year-round flow. The three great lakes of Northern Rhodesia are Lake Bangweulu in the northern districts and lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundaries. Lake Bangweulu and the swamps at its southern end cover an area of about 3,800 square miles, and there are a number of other much smaller lakes such as Lake Young in the Mpika district, Lake Chila near Abercorn, Lake Chirengwa near Ndola and Luswasi Lake (or Lake Moir) off the Great North Road to the north of Serenje.

Northern Rhodesia has the greatest waterfall in the world, the Victoria Falls, on its southern boundary and the highest waterfall in Africa, Kalambo Falls, 704 feet, on its northern border.

HISTORY

The first explorations, north of the Zambesi were carried out by various Portuguese travellers at the end of the eighteenth century. The first British person to enter Northern Rhodesia was Dr. Livingstone who reached the Zambesi in 1855. The Arab slave trade had begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and flourished from that time onwards till 1893, 20 years after the death of Livingstone at Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most felt in the north but soon extended over the whole country. It was not until 1893, by which time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations were established, that this trade received any check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake Nyasa, and with the defeat of the Arab chief Mlozy by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894, the days of the slave trade in British Central Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves in Northern Rhodesia (interceptioned on its way to the east coast via Lake Nyasa) was released at Fort Jameson, which had just been established, in 1898.

On 29th October, 1889, a Royal Charter was granted to the British South Africa Company conferring upon it large powers of administration in Rhodesia to carry out the objects for which it was formed, the principal being to extend northwards the railway and telegraph systems of the Cape Colony and Bechuanaland, to encourage emigration and colonisation, to promote trade and commerce and to develop and work mineral and other concessions.

Prior to 1911 the territory now called Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On 4th May of that year these two territories were amalgamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia.

Several engagements took place during the Great War with forces from German East Africa.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Administrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also Administrator of Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the various outstanding questions relating to the British South Africa Company's position in Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika Province of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway...
interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on 25th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

CONSTITUTION

By Orders-in-Council dated 20th February, 1924, the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Financial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Secretary for Native Affairs and the Economic Secretary. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, 9 official members and 13 unofficial members, of whom 8 are elected and 5 nominated by the Governor; of the nominated members 3 are nominated to represent African interests.

POPULATION

A census was held in October, 1946, of all Europeans, Asiatics and Coloured persons, and also of Africans in employment; this showed the population to be as follows:

Europeans:
- Male: 11,276
- Female: 10,643
- Total: 21,919

(This figure includes 3,181 Polish evacuees)

Asiatics:
- Male: 835
- Female: 284
- Total: 1,119

Coloured:
- Male: 427
- Female: 362
- Total: 789

Africans (estimated, as at 31st December, 1946):
- Total population: 1,541,720

ADMINISTRATION

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen, who function as native authorities and courts. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District Officers. The Barotse Province is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a khota or native council to assist him.

The law of the territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the territory unless it has been specifically applied.

Administrative officers in their capacities as magistrates of subordinate courts have a limited civil and criminal jurisdiction. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from subordinate courts of the 3rd class to provincial commissioners' courts and from subordinate courts (including provincial commissioners' courts) of the 1st and 2nd class to the High Court.

RELIGION

Estimated figures are as follows:

1. European:
   - Christian:
     - Roman Catholics: 2,250
     - Protestants: 18,330
   - Non-Christian: 20,580
   - Total: 21,919

2. Asiatics:
   - Christians: 18
   - Hindus: 768
   - Mohammedans: 333
   - Total: 1,119

3. Coloured:
   - Christians: 723
   - Mohammedans: 18
   - Hindus: 5
   - Agnostics: 19
   - Pagans: 24
   - Total: 789

4. Africans:
   - Roman Catholics: 120,584
   - Protestants: 145,367
   - Pagans: 1,275,769
   - Total: 1,541,720

BANKING AND CURRENCY

There are branches of the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., at Livingstone, Lusaka, Broken Hill, Ndola, Kitwe, Luanshya, Mufulira and Mazabuka, an agency at Chugola, and branches of Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) at Lusaka, Livingstone, Broken Hill, Fort Jameson, Ndola, Kitwe, Luanshya and Mufulira, and an agency at Chugola.

The currency of Northern Rhodesia is that of Southern Rhodesia. United Kingdom coin is also legal tender, but is being withdrawn. South African currency is not legal tender.

COMMUNICATIONS

Railways

The railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906 and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a single span bridge, 650 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Branch lines have now been constructed from Ndola to Luanshya (Roan Antelope Mine), a distance of 24 miles, and to Nchanga via Nkana, a distance of 84 miles. Another line runs from Mokambo, in the Belgian Congo, to Mufulira nine miles distant.
Roads

Road communications have been improved and further improvements are being undertaken. The arterial road system has been provided with a large number of permanent bridges and culverts and a programme to complete this work is in hand. The main arterial roads are:

(i) The Great North Road from the Otto Beit Bridge over the Zambesi River at Chirundu on the Southern Rhodesia border via Kafue, where the road joins the railway line, Lusaka, Broken Hill and Kapiri Mposhi, where the road leaves the railway line to Mpika, Isoka, and Tunduma where the road joins the Tanganyika and Nyasaland road systems. The length of the Great North Road is 750 miles. From Mpika there is a road to Abercorn and Mpulungu Harbour on Lake Tanganyika via Kasama, a distance of 270 miles and from Abercorn there is a connection to Tunduma, a distance of 114 miles.

(ii) The Livingstone Road from Livingstone follows the railway line northwards until it meets the Great North Road at Kafue River, a distance of 276 miles.

(iii) The Great East Road runs from Lusaka eastwards to Fort Jameson and the Nyasaland border, a distance of 400 miles. This road crosses the Luangwa River at 150 miles from Lusaka by an imposing bridge presented to the territory by the Beit Trust.

(iv) The Congo Border road which branches from the Great North Road 3 miles north of Kapiri Mposhi proceeds north to the Copper mining area and from there on to Solwezi and Mwinilunga, a distance of 498 miles. The Kafue River near Nkana is crossed by another large bridge presented by the Beit Trust. From Solwezi there is a road southwards to Kasemba and Mumbwa then running eastwards to join the Great North Road 45 miles north of Lusaka.

From Kasemba a road 229 miles in length runs westwards to Balovale.

A new road 122 miles in length from Mufulira across the pedicle of the Congo to Fort Rosebery and the Northern Province is expected to be opened this year.

In the copper mining area, Ndola-Luanshya and Nkana are connected by bituminous surfaced roads and it is expected that Nkana-Nchanga and Mululira will be connected with similar surfaces within a short time. The road from Livingstone to the Victoria Falls has a bituminous surface also.

In addition to the above main roads there is a large mileage of secondary roads serving the settled areas and districts.

Rivers

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula, and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aviation

The corridor route through the territory follows the track joining the four main control airfields of Kasama, Ndola, Lusaka Livingstone, where immigration, custom and sanitary control facilities are established, and where Aeradio communication facilities are installed and operated. Ten secondary airfields are connected with these main airfields by internal scheduled services operated by Central African Airways Corporation.

Routes are as follows:

(a) Internal

(i) Lusaka – Ndola – Kasama – Abercorn, including Mpika on request.

(ii) Lusaka – Fort Jameson.

(iii) Lusaka – Mumbwa – Mankoya – Mongu – Kalabo – Balovale.

(iv) Lusaka – Livingstone – Sesheke – Kalabo – Mongu – Balovale.

(b) External

(i) Salisbury – Lusaka – Ndola – Mbeya – Tabora – Nairobi.

(c) Two aircraft charter companies are licensed in Northern Rhodesia: Messrs. Thatcher Hobson Airways, Ltd., and Messrs. Zambesi Airways, Ltd., who provide charter facilities for passengers and freight at fares varying between 1s. 3d. and 1s. 6d. per mile, to any of the 38 airfields or landing grounds established in the territory.

Detailed information concerning civil aviation in Northern Rhodesia is incorporated in the 1947 edition of the Northern Rhodesia Air Pilot, obtainable from the Secretary for Civil Aviation or the Government Printer, Northern Rhodesia.

Posts, Telegraphs and Wireless

There is a daily mail service by rail between offices on the line of rail. Offices off the line of rail receive and despatch mails at least once a week. Mails for Fort Jameson, Mankoya, Mongu, Lealui and places in the Northern Province are conveyed by air. Other cross posts are by motor vehicle or carriers. Mails to and from adjoining countries are despatched by all passenger trains. Air mails for overseas countries are forwarded by South African Airways (Springbok service) twice a week, connection with the main service being made at Nairobi or Salisbury by Central African Airways feeder services. Seaborne mails are forwarded via Capetown once a week.

There are 48 post offices, 14 of which are money order offices and 26 are telegraph offices. The main telegraph and telephone route lies alongside the railway line from Victoria Falls to the Belgian Congo Border with branches from Ndola to Luanshya and Ndola to Kitwe, Chingola and Mufulira.

Wireless stations at Abercorn, Fort Jameson, Kasama, Mpika, Mongu-Lealui, Balovale, Kasemba and Mwinilunga, maintain a public service while stations at Kasama, Lusaka and Ndola are equipped for communication with aircraft in flight as well as for point to point working.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Education

European

At the end of 1946 there were 13 Government schools in the territory. Of these, 11 offered primary education up to Standard 5 and secondary education up to Form II. The schools at Silver
Rest and Fort Jameson provided instruction only within the primary range (K.G. to Standard 5). The total enrolment at Government schools was 2,147.

Certain controlled schools under private management catered for children below the permissive school age and others offered instruction within the Government school range. In addition, the Broken Hill Convent School offered secondary education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard (Form IV) and the Luanshya Convent School had a Form III, in which general instruction including commercial subjects was given. At other convent schools, instruction in commercial subjects and music was made available to pupils after Form II. The total enrolment at controlled schools under private management was 637.

Boarding accommodation was available at four Government schools and four private schools.

By arrangement with the Southern Rhodesia Education Department correspondence tuition was provided, as required, for children (mainly six to eight years old) living more than three miles from the nearest day school.

Coloured and Asiatic

Katembwe School, under Government management, offered education for Coloured children in the primary range. There was one private Government-aided Indian school.

African

The Department of African Education supervises the educational work of the mission societies which, assisted through a grant-in-aid system, are responsible for the management of the majority of schools in the territory. There is an advisory board on African Education with Mission, African and Government representatives.

In 1946 there were 1,168 schools receiving grant-in-aid, including 26 native authority schools. Tuition is free, fees are paid at boarding schools. Primary education is divided into three grades: Elementary (Sub-Std. A to Std. II); Lower Middle (Stds. III and IV); Upper Middle (Stds. V and VI). The teaching of English normally begins in Sub-St. B. Teachers for the elementary and lower middle schools are trained at two Government and 19 mission centres of which five are specifically for girls. The total enrolment in all types of assisted and Government schools is 135,000, of whom 42,000 are girls. Compulsory education for the age group, 12–16 years, has been introduced into three districts on the Copperbelt and at Broken Hill and Livingstone. As staff and buildings become available it will be introduced at other urban centres.

There are 30 Government schools. The Jeanes School, Chalimbana, trains school supervisors and teachers for the primary schools and also provides an annual course for Chiefs. The Munali Training Centre, Lusaka, includes a trade school and a secondary school with classes going up to the Cambridge School Certificate standard. Africans who desire higher education go either to Makerere College, Uganda, or to the South African College, Fort Hare. Government gives bursaries to those who qualify and are selected for higher education.

The estimated expenditure on African education for 1948 is £232,310 of which £145,169 is grants-in-aid for recurrent expenditure.

### Taxation

An income tax was first imposed in Northern Rhodesia in 1921. The rates of tax now in force are:

#### Individuals

The following deductions are allowed from the total income in arriving at the chargeable income:

(a) Personal deduction:
   - For unmarried persons: £250
   - For married persons: £500

(b) Deduction for children:
   - For each child: £120

(c) Deduction for dependants:
   - The amount expended, limited to the amount by which the income of the dependant falls short of £250. Where there are two or more persons jointly maintaining the dependant the deduction is apportioned between them.

(d) Life, Accident and Sickness Insurance:
   - The annual premium paid, not exceeding one-sixth of the total income less £250, with a maximum deduction of £120.

(e) Widowers, or others similarly situated, who have custody of and who support their children, receive the allowances and are taxed at the rates applicable to married persons.

Trade and Industry

Agriculture

The total cattle population in 1946 was 702,935, an increase of 1,147 head over the 1945 figures. No major outbreaks of disease or climatic disasters have occurred to cause heavy mortality during recent years. Stock ranching is confined to areas free from trypanosomiasis. Contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia in Barotse-land is no longer regarded as endemic. An abattoir built by Government in Livingstone to assist the eradication of this disease commenced operations early in 1944 and helped to relieve the meat shortage within the territory.

Consumption of livestock and livestock products outpaces local production and in these circumstances livestock producers have been able to dispose of all produce to advantage. Subsidy payments on approved breeding stock and on increased butterfat production have been arranged as an interim measure to stimulate production by European livestock farmers.

Free inoculation against the more common endemic diseases—principally quarter-evil and anthrax, dipping of cattle and instruction of cattle owners in better animal husbandry methods are proceeding in the native reserves, but progress is slow.

The greater portion of the territory is undeveloped agriculturally. The indigenous population is self-supporting in its food supply, practically the whole of its requirements being produced in the village gardens. There is little general trade in food commodities except in the railway belt where the surplus native maize crop is marketed by the Maize Control Board. The staple native cereals are finger millet (Eleusine coracana), Kaffir-corn (Sorghum), and maize. The former is produced over extensive tracts of the territory on a system of shifting cultivation whereby grain crops are grown in rotation with forest re-growths. Other native crops are bulrush millet (Pennisetum typhoideum), ground-nuts, cassava, sweet-potatoes and a variety of pumpkins, gourds, and beans. Tobacco is widely cultivated by the natives but on a small scale for private consumption and a small localised trade only. Considerable numbers of cattle are owned by natives in the territory, but these are mainly confined to certain tribes, notably the Marosi, Baila, Matoka, and, to a less extent, the Angoni in north-eastern Rhodesia.

Many parts of the territory are impassable to animal transport owing to the presence of tsetse fly.

In the tracts adjoining the railway line considerable areas are given over to farming and ranching operations under European management.

Maize is the chief crop of the settler. In the season 1945/46 total maize production for sale was 451,000 bags, of which 440,000 were received from the railway line and 11,000 bags were sent in from distant areas. Wheat is grown under irrigation and is at present exported to Bulawayo for milling. Some 27,000 bags were grown in 1946.

Flue-cured Virginia tobacco is produced chiefly in the Eastern Province. Tobacco production in 1946 was 3,130,000 lbs. of flue-cured Virginia and approximately 1,000,000 lb. of Turkish leaf. 400,000 pounds of Northern Rhodesia leaf are admitted annually, duty free, to the Union of South Africa. Southern Rhodesia takes approximately a further 450,000 pounds. The balance of the Virginia tobacco is exported overseas.

Turkish tobacco production is a recent development. It is grown mainly in the railway belt. The headquarters of the Agricultural Department and the Veterinary Department are at Mazabuka.

Forestry

More than one half of the area of the colony is covered by tree growth, mostly in the form of open woodland. Apart from a minute fraction of evergreen fringing forest along river banks, it is estimated that only 7 per cent. (21,000 square miles) of the woodland is capable of yielding saw timber, with yields that range between 50 and 500 cubic feet per acre.

The amount of privately owned forest is negligible in total area, but rights of mining and private use cover some of the best and most strategically placed forests on the Copper-belt. The Forests Ordinance, 1941, and subsidiary regulations provide for the control and protection of forest growth on Crown Lands, and grant considerable latitude in the free use of forest produce to local inhabitants. In Native Reserves more restricted powers of control are contained in certain sections of the Native Reserves Regulations. The Barotse Native Government and a few other smaller Native Authorities have adopted orders that provide additional local protection.

1,628 square miles have been declared as Forest Reserves and Protected Forest Areas.

The Baikiaea plurijuga (Rhodesian "Teak") forests support at Livingstone the largest saw-milling industry in South Central Africa; the present rate of cutting in Northern Rhodesia (2½ million cubic feet of logs per annum, most of which are converted to railway sleepers) is resulting in exhaustion of the forests. The mining companies cut in 1946 a further 957,000 cubic feet of local timber (mainly Brachystegia and Isoberlinia species), and another 200,000 cubic feet was cut in the territory for minor industries. Other recorded consumption in 1946 included 197,000 poles and 92,000 cords of firewood. Very considerable quantities of firewood, poles and timber are used by the rural African population for domestic purposes, but it is impossible to estimate this consumption; in general this demand is so dispersed that only in a few localities does it represent a marked drain on the forests. Much more destructive are the shifting cultivation systems of agriculture that are traditional over most of the territory, and for which it is often difficult to find sounder and more stable alternatives.

A scarcity of trees exists in some of the floodplain regions of Bangweulu, the upper Zambesi and the Middle Kafue: tree-planting trials have been started in the Bandweulu swamp with a view to reducing the scarcity of wood that is a limiting factor in improving the living conditions of the inhabitants. As there are no coniferous forests in Northern Rhodesia and softwoods have to be imported for many industrial purposes, a programme of planting sub-tropical species of pines is being started on the Copperbelt, where initial trials with these trees have given promising results.

A Forestry Branch has existed as part of the Department of Agriculture since 1929, but was given separate departmental status at the beginning of 1947. It commences its career with a regular staff of 12 European and 108 Africans and a variable force of casual labour.
Land Settlement

An Agriculture Survey Commission reported in 1932 upon the alienated land within 25 miles of the railway suitable for European Settlement and this Commission advised as to the class of farming for which the land is suitable. A Land Tenure Committee has since recommended the abolition of freehold title and Crown Land is now obtainable on 30, 99 or 999 years' lease only. A Select Committee of Legislative Council has reported upon Land Settlement questions and a Land Board has been set up, with headquarters in Lusaka, to administer various loan schemes.

Crown Land and privately owned land suitable for mixed farming, ranching, and tobacco planting is available within easy distance of the railway, and the price ranges between 1s. 8d. and 50s. an acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from the railway, nature of title, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £3,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a leaschold farm from Government. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Commissioner for Lands, Livingstone.

Minerals

The Department of Mines administers the Mining Law, the Mining and Explosives Regulations, the Mining (Silicosis Prevention) Regulations, the Winding Engine Driver's (Certificate of Competency) Regulations, and the Factories Ordinance and Factories (Safety) Regulations. The Registration of Mining Titles is carried out by the Registrar of Titles in the Lands and Surveys Department.

The copper produced in the territory in 1946 totalled 182,829 tons, valued at £12,347,371 as against 194,077 tons valued at £11,247,574 in 1945. The production of the various copper mines in 1946 was:—Mufulira, 46,610 tons of blister copper; Nchanga, 20,443 tons of blister copper and 253 tons of copper concentrates which were sold as concentrates; Nkana, 10,118 tons of blister copper; 53,540 tons of electrolytic copper and 287 tons of Copper other; Roan Antelope, 51,578 tons of blister copper. As a by-product Nkana also produced 24,069 cwts of cobalt alloy and 6,594 ozs. of gold, 634,392 ozs. of silver and 108,889 lbs. of selenium, which were recovered from refinery slimes accumulated during the preceding five years. During 1946 the new mill and concentrating plant at Nchanga was completed and put into operation. At the latter part of 1946, sinking operations were commenced at the Roan Antelope, on the new Irwin shaft which is to serve that part of the ore-body known as the Roan Extension.

Lead, zinc and vanadium are produced at Broken Hill by underground methods and open-cast mining has ceased. During 1946 the new plant to treat sulphide ores was completed and brought into operation.

Some of the lead produced is fabricated at the mine into pipes and sheets for use in the metallurgical plant and the manganese ore is used as a re-agent in the production of zinc. The value of the major products from Broken Hill during 1946 is lead, £486,225; zinc, £869,512; and vanadium, £74,767.

Other mineral activities are on a small scale.

The mineral production for the years 1945 and 1946 was:

Customs Duties

The tariff, excluding the Congo Basin tariff, provides for Empire preference for the following classes of goods which are mainly liable to ad valorem rates of duty; clothing, blankets and rugs, cotton piece goods, motor cars, and all articles usually imported for household and native use, the duty on Empire products being in almost every instance 10 per cent. and the duty on foreign varying from 15 to 30 per cent.; in the case of cotton and silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, and rubber shoes, from foreign countries, the tariff provides for additional or alternative specific rates if the duty should be greater at such rates. Agricultural, electrical, mining and other industrial machinery, pipes and piping, metals and metal manufactures imported for industrial purposes, if of Empire manufacture are free of duty and if foreign are subject to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent., except foreign electrical machinery which is 10 per cent.

Specific rates of duty apply to practically all imported foodstuffs, lubricating oils, paraffin and cement, and to spirits, wines, beer and tobacco; upon the latter items, apart from rum, bitters, beer and cigars, no preference is granted except under the terms of the customs agreements with the neighbouring territories in the south, but varying rates of preference are granted, under the tariff, to foodstuffs of British origin.
