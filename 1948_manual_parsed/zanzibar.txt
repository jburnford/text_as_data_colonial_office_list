ZANZIBAR

History

The beginnings of Zanzibar history are lost in antiquity. It appears more than probable that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were known to the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Jews, but though the expedition of Necho (c. 600 B.C.) doubtless passed the islands it is not till the first century that the Periplus gives a description of one of them under the name of Menuthias. The Hindus appear to have settled at a very early date and traces of Greek colonisation are not lacking. From about the 7th century B.C. the islands appear to have had a close connection with the South Arabian states. Bantu settlers probably made their appearance during the first five centuries A.D., and thereafter, for the next 500 years or so, came also traders from China and Malaya, in addition to those from the Persian Gulf. The coast was probably converted to Islam early in the 10th century. The Zenj Empire was founded by Ali bin Hassan, a prince of Shiraz, about 975 A.D., but it soon broke up into separate states, and, by the time the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral, was already declining. It was during the 16th century that the Arabs of the east coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa fort in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the 17th century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856, a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar, the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by transferring his capital from Muscat and making the island his permanent residence in the year 1832. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "everybody as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognised by France and Germany, and they were declared a British protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude, were ceded to Italy, Great Britain and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of £200,000. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of £144,000.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the British Government assumed more direct control over the protectorate and reorganised the government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

The government was vested in a High Commissioner, who was also Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, and a British Resident. The High Commissionership was abolished in 1925.

A Protectorate Council, with His Highness as President, was established at the same time. It was of an advisory and consultative nature and ceased to exist in 1926 when Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted.

Constitution and Government

The government is administered by a British Resident, who is appointed by commission under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924.

The law of the protectorate consists of Orders-in-Council, the decrees of the Sultan, and certain Imperial statutes of general application. His Highness's decrees and legislation subsidiary thereto, when countersigned by the British resident under Article 42 of the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are binding upon all persons. The Muhammadan Law is, by Section 7 of the Courts Decree (Cap. 3), declared to be the fundamental law of His Highness's dominions in civil matters.

There are Executive and Legislative Councils, established by the Councils Decree (Cap. 28, R.L.Z. 1934).

The existence of two sets of courts, comprising His Britannic Majesty's court and the court of His Highness the Sultan, and the courts subordinate thereto, respectively, has led to a form of "dual jurisdiction" in the protectorate which, although interesting from the historical point of view, has little practical bearing.

Justice, in cases in which persons subject to the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are concerned, is administered by H.B.M.'s High Court and the courts subordinate to it, and in other cases by H.H. the Sultan's Court for Zanzibar and the courts subordinate to that court. Subordinate courts are held by resident magistrates, administrative officers and Arab kathis. In addition, district courts, under the presidency of Arab administrative officers (mudirs), exercise a limited criminal jurisdiction. An appeal lies from the British court and from the Zanzibar court in the exercise of their original civil and criminal jurisdiction to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa and thence to the Privy Council.

Population

(Estimated, 1945)

The population of the protectorate, estimated from the census of 1931, can be taken as 250,000 (Zanzibar Island, 150,000; Pemba Island, 100,000).
The racial composition is estimated as follows:

- Europeans: 250
- Arabs: 34,000
- Indians: 16,000
- Africans: 199,750

Total: 250,000

Zanzibar Island: 150,000
Pemba Island: 100,000

The population of the township of Zanzibar is estimated to be 50,000.

Currency and Banking

The standard coin of the protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage:
- 50 cts. (silver) and 10 cts., 5 cts., 1 ct. (bronze).

East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon. The amount in circulation at 31st December, 1946, was notes £442,140 and coin £239,233.

Two British banks maintain branches in the territory:—The National Bank of India, Ltd. and the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd.—both at Zanzibar.

There is also one private Indian banking firm, Messrs. Jetha Lila.

There are no agricultural co-operative societies and the Clove Growers Association provides finance for agriculturists, granting short and long term loans; the system of chattel mortgages is used extensively.

There is a Government Savings Bank with 11,045 depositors at the end of 1946 and total deposits of £270,095.

Communications

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of transhipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the Benadir coast.

It possesses an excellent water supply, the best on the east coast of Africa. A considerable quantity is supplied to shipping annually.

Government steamers maintain regular weekly connection with Pemba and Dar-es-Salaam. Zanzibar has become a port of call in the itinerary of a number of large tourist steamers.

Cable & Wireless, Ltd., owns and operates the cable station whence telegraphic communication is maintained via Aden, via Seychelles, via Durban, via Mombasa, via Dar-es-Salaam, with all parts of the world through the company’s system.

The maximum word rates to Great Britain and all parts of the Empire are:—Full rate, 1 sh. 25 cts., C.D.E., 85 cts. (5 words minimum), deferred 65 cts. (5 words minimum), letter telegrams, 45 cts. (25 words minimum), Empire social telegram, 45 cts. (12 words minimum).

There are 191·44 miles of roads throughout the island of Zanzibar and 74·07 miles in Pemba suitable for motor traffic. The Government maintains wireless stations and telephone systems in Zanzibar and Pemba.

There are nine Savings Bank offices in the two islands.

With effect from 0100 hours on the 1st January, 1948, East African Zone Time of G.M.T. plus three hours instead of East African Standard Time of G.M.T. plus 2½ hours was adopted by Zanzibar.

Industries and Trade

The protectorate of Zanzibar is still the dominant partner in the clove industry, holding as it does the greater part of the shares. The other partners are Madagascar and the Dutch East Indies, with Penang a very small shareholder.

Authorities differ as to the date when and the country from which the clove tree was first introduced into Zanzibar. Some say that it was brought from Réunion by an Arab at the end of the 18th century. Colonel Rigby, Her Majesty’s Consul and British Agent, in his report on the Zanzibar dominions written in the year 1860, states “the first clove trees were introduced about 30 years ago from Mauritius; being found to thrive they were extensively planted and they have now become the most valuable production of these islands.”

To Seyyid Said belongs the credit of establishing and promoting the clove industry. Burton records that he threatened confiscation to those who did not plant three clove trees for every coconut and that the country was almost denuded of the latter to make room for cloves. In 1839–40 the output amounted to about frasils 9,000. (The frasil, equivalent to 35 lbs., is the local measure of weight for cloves.) In 1849 it had risen to frasils 120,000. In 1859 frasils 139,000, valued at £55,666, were exported, and the average output during the next decade was frasils 200,000, valued at about £85,000. Owing to the increase in production the price had, however, fallen from $5–$6 to $1–$2.

In 1872 a hurricane of great violence swept over the island of Zanzibar and destroyed two-thirds of the clove and coconut trees. Pemba, though touched by the hurricane, sustained little damage. The years following this disaster were years of short supply, high prices, and intensive cultivation. The Pemba owners, actuated by motives of gain, hastened to cut down coconut trees on a wholesale scale throughout the island and to plant clove trees in their place. The Zanzibar owners, though temporarily ruined, set to work with commendable fortitude to replace the trees which the hurricane had destroyed, and 10 years after the hurricane the normal output of cloves had not only been restored but increased.

Another event of great economic importance to the industry was the abolition of slavery. The industry was built up and for many years sustained on slave labour imported from the interior
of Africa. In 1873 Seyyid Bargash entered into a treaty to suppress the sea-borne traffic in slaves and to close all public markets in his dominions for the buying or selling of imported slaves. Various treaties and legislative measures followed until the year 1897, when by a decree of Seyyid Hamoud the legal status of slavery was abolished. It may be noted parenthetically that in the year 1890 Great Britain assumed a protectorate over Zanzibar.

The history of labour subsequent to 1897 is a tale of shortage, disinclination on the part of the labour available to engage in any form of settled work, inability or disinclination on the part of the Arabs to pay money wages, and administrative effort to organise the available supply. The introduction of Indian labour was at one time or another canvassed but never materialised. In 1904 and 1906 and at other subsequent times recourse was had to recruitment of labour on the mainland.

In recent years recruitment of labour from outside the protectorate has ceased and Zanzibar has, to an increasing degree, become dependent for its agricultural labour (particularly clove pickers) upon local natives, augmented by mainlanders who have come over voluntarily in search of work.

Since the abolition of slavery the event of major economic importance has been the settlement by Government of agricultural indebtedness.

There has been a significant and satisfactory price stability in the clove industry since marketing was placed on a managed basis.

Production has been well maintained, and, despite fluctuating exports owing to shortage of shipping during the war years, there has been no difficulty in disposing of stocks. Exports for 1946 were 310,258 cwts., valued at £1,159,322.

The distillation of clove oil has expanded considerably. The exports during 1938 were 235,518 lb., valued at £24,366 compared with 410,677 lb., valued at £83,784 for 1946.

The Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927 and incorporated by decree in 1934, assists in stabilising the price of cloves, and distils and markets clove oil.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 57,000 acres under cultivation and four million trees in both islands. The export of domestic copra in 1946 amounted to 8,035 tons, valued at £204,113, and in addition other coconut products to the value of £81,132 were exported. Much is produced by the small grower or trader neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Ceylon.

Cloves, mangrove bark and chillies are examined and graded prior to export under the Agricultural Produce Export Decree. The quality of copra is controlled as far as possible under the Adulteration of Produce Decree.

There is a general ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. on imported goods, with the exception of certain articles which have either a specific duty or a higher ad valorem duty, such as spirits, motor spirit, kerosene, cigarettes, tobacco, matches, tea, cotton and artificial silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, boots and shoes, etc. There is also a schedule of articles exempt from duty. The tariff includes no provisions for Empire preference.

The main industry of the protectorate is the production of cloves of which it furnishes the major part of the requirements of the world. Clove oil, extracted mainly from stems, is also exported. Other normal exports (including re-exports of imported goods) are copra, coconut oil, oil cake, soap, mangrove bark, fresh fruit, millet, ivory, textiles and petroleum products. There are oil seed crushing plants and soap factories, but the country is predominantly agricultural.

Principal articles of import are rice and grain, textiles, motor spirit and petroleum, sugar, tobacco and cigarettes, flour, ghee, sesame, cattle, dried fish, jute-bags and sacks and straw bags.
