TANGANYIKA

EXTENT AND BOUNDARIES

Tanganyika consists of that portion of the former colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the colony, namely the territory of Ruanda-Urundi in the north-west, and the Kionga area, south of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Umbe River on the north to the Rovuma River on the south, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands.

The northern boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of south latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Rubabu Peninsula), thence along the first parallel of south latitude until it meets the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River up stream to its junction with the Kakitumba River thence along the eastern boundary of the Belgian mandated territory of Ruanda-Urundi to a point on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika at approximately 4° 27' south latitude. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the median line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows in a southerly direction to the mouth of the Kalambo River at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Northern...
Rhodesia and Nyasaland to the mouth of the Songwe River at the north end of Lake Nyasa. Thence it follows the shore of the lake, first in a northerly and then in a southerly direction, to a point on the eastern shore of the lake at approximately 11° 35' south latitude, thence the boundary runs in an easterly direction to the Rovuma River whose course it follows to the sea.

The total area of the Territory is 362,688 square miles which includes 19,982 square miles of water.

The island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

CLIMATE

The climate of the Territory varies greatly according to the height above sea-level of the several districts. Roughly, four climatic zones can be distinguished, though even among these there are considerable local variations:—(i) the warm and rather damp coast region with its adjoining hinterland. Here, conditions are tropical, though not unpleasant except just before and during the rainy seasons, when the heat is trying and the atmosphere humid. The average yearly temperature is 78 degrees. (ii) The hot and moderately dry zone between the coast and the central plateau (300 feet–2,000 feet). This zone is characterised by low humidity of atmosphere, less rain, and a temperature rather lower but with greater daily and yearly variations. (iii) The hot and dry zone of the central plateau between 2,000 feet and 4,000 feet in height. The climate of this zone differs greatly in parts, but its prevailing characteristics are low humidity, little rainfall (at Tabora an annual average of 32 inches), a fairly high mean temperature, with great daily and yearly variations, sometimes exceeding 36° F. daily. The heat is dry, but not so trying to the European as the moist and steamy warmth of the coast, while the nights are invariably cold. (iv) The semi-temperate regions around the slopes of Kilimanjaro and Meru, of the Usambara Highlands, the Ufipa Plateau, and the mountainous areas of the south-western area (5,000 feet–10,000 feet). Frosts occur at the higher altitudes and the nights are cold. These districts enjoy a bracing climate, and alone can be considered healthy for Europeans, but prolonged residence in these altitudes is apt to produce nervous strain, even though physical fitness is maintained. There are two well-defined rainy seasons annually. Generally speaking, the long rains begin in February or March, and last for two or three months, while the short rainy season extends from October to November, but the rainfall is low for a tropical country, and droughts are not infrequent.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,534 feet; Nyasa, 1,568 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 61,600) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which is situated at the junction of the old caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mbeya, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway and Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilimanjaro, which rises to 19,565 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,979 feet). In the south-west is the Kipengere Range where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz., the southern portion of Lake Victoria and the eastern portion of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika. There are smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

HISTORY AND CONSTITUTION

Plentiful evidence exists of Arab traders having visited the Territory for several centuries and of their opening up the great slave route from Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean to Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika. The British explorer, Burton, first entered the Territory in 1856, and was soon followed by Speke, Livingstone and Stanley.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made 12 treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilimanjaro and occupied Moshi on 13th March of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on 1st January, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in 1919 appointing an Administrator. The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on 25th September, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor was assisted by an Executive Council. In 1921 the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ufipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

In 1920 draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain lays down conditions
directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of states members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated 19th March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, 13 official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on 1st July, 1926.

A further Order in Council which came into operation on 23rd November, 1945, altered the constitution of the Council to consist of the Governor as President, 15 official members and not more than 14 unofficial members. The first African members of the Legislative Council—two in number—took their seats in Council on 3rd December, 1945, and a third African chief was appointed an Unofficial Member of the Council on 13th June, 1947.

In January, 1946, His Majesty's Government announced to the first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations their intention of placing Tanganyika under the international trusteeship system established by the United Nations Charter.

**POPULATION**

The number of Europeans, including Polish and other refugees, in Tanganyika is approximately 6,563. There are also over 57,765 Asiatics, chiefly Indians, Arabs and Goans. The natives are estimated at 5,658,015. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Masai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important language is Swahili, which is a hybrid between Arabic and Persian and all sorts of African tongues. It is more or less spoken as a Lingua Franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but the majority of the coastal tribes and a few in the hinterland profess Mohammedanism.

Tanganyika is divided into eight provinces as follows:

| Provinces | Capital     | Approx. Native Population |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Central   | Dodoma      | 619,765                  |
| Eastern   | Dar-es-Salaam | 658,163                |
| Southern  | Mbeya       | 565,000                  |
| Highlands | Mwanza      | 1,596,868                |
| Lake      | Lindi       | 630,309                  |
| Southern  | Arusha      | 413,400                  |
| Tanga     | Tanga       | 436,990                  |
| Western   | Tabora      | 727,520                  |
| Totals    |             | 5,658,015                |

**ADMINISTRATION**

For the purposes of administration the territory is divided into eight provinces, each in charge of a provincial commissioner. Each province comprises a number of districts in charge of district commissioners. There are 47 such districts in the territory.

The form of native administration operating in Tanganyika is a system of local self-government commonly known as "Indirect Rule". Under this system the tribal units in the various districts are constituted native authorities by a Native Authority Ordinance. There are four classes of such authorities. The first is the chief native authority, the so-called paramount chief; he usually has less important chiefs under him, who are gazetted as subordinate to the chief native authority. The native treasury, in this class, is under the direct control of the paramount chief. Secondly, certain federations of chiefs are recognised as native authorities: each chief is the authority in his own unit and retains independent executive powers; but the members of the federation combine for certain purposes, principally to constitute a joint treasury and for the passing of rules and orders applicable throughout the federation. The third class is the tribal council, consisting of petty chiefs or headmen belonging to the same tribe and with a common treasury. Fourthly, there is the small chief or headman of a more or less isolated portion of a tribe in areas which recognise no wider political authority. Each is appointed a native authority with limited powers and a small treasury.

In addition to the general obligation to assist the central Government in maintaining order and preventing crime in the areas under their jurisdiction, native authorities may issue executive orders or rules on a variety of matters. They also act as agencies of the Government in the discharge of a number of its social activities.

The resources of the native treasuries consist in a rebate on the house and poll tax collected in their areas, native court fees and local dues such as ferry and market fees. In 1947 the estimated total revenue accruing to the treasuries from these and other sources amounted to £452,764. The total expenditure, including the amount spent on capital works financed from surplus balances, was estimated at £514,068. The surplus balances at the end of the year are estimated to amount to £417,116.

The native courts, which form an integral part of the system of local government described above, are constituted under a Native Courts Ordinance. They are given limited jurisdiction to try cases in which both parties are natives, in accordance with native law and custom. Their proceedings are subject to inspection by administrative officers who are also empowered to revise their decisions. Appeals lie to the executive authorities and not to the High Court. All fees and fines collected are paid into the native treasuries. In 1946, these courts dealt with a total of 110,092 cases, of which 56,665 were civil cases and 53,427 were cases of a criminal nature.

The flexibility of the organisation of the native administration on both its executive and its judicial side has been preserved and its structure has not yet taken final shape. There has been a progressive integration of the traditional native institutions into the general administrative system, as is shown by the growing use of rules and orders issued by the native authorities to serve the purposes of government. At the present stage of development there is, not unnaturally, a
marked inequality in the efficiency of the different native authorities, and the character of the native administrations as a whole may be said to depend largely on the extent of the supervision exercised.

RELIGION

The majority of the inhabitants of the Territory, are pagans. Common features among many tribal beliefs are a belief in a supreme being and in the possibility of communion with the spirits of the departed.

There is a large African Moslem population to be found chiefly in the coastal areas and in the up-country trading settlements. They are followers of the Sunni school.

Christian missions are active and numerous in the territory. It is estimated that Christian Africans now number at least 680,000, of whom some 433,000 are Roman Catholic. The principal Roman Catholic missions now operating in the territory are the White Fathers, the Society of the Holy Ghost, the Capuchin Fathers, the Swiss Benedictines, the Consolata Fathers and the Passionist Fathers.

The principal Protestant missions are the Universities Mission to Central Africa, the Church Missionary Society, the Moravian Mission and the Augustana Lutheran Mission.

Among the immigrant Indian population the majority are Hindus, Sikhs and Moslem Khoja Ismailias and Ithnashiris.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The German Government and the Deutch Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft minted and issued silver rupees of the Indian standard and subsidiary coins. The silver coinage was redeemed at the rate of 2s. of East African currency to the rupee, was withdrawn from circulation and ceased to be legal tender as from 1st April, 1923. The period of the redemption of the subsidiary nickel and copper coinage (hellers) expired on 15th August, 1925. It became necessary to redeem Indian silver coinage at the same rate and redemption was effected by 23rd July, 1921.

The only currency now recognised in the Territory is shillings and subsidiary coins and currency notes of the East African Currency Board.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), and the Banque du Congo Belge.

COMMUNICATIONS

Railways and Roads

Tanganyika is served by two railways of metre gauge.

(1) The Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam to Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika (774½ miles), with a branch line from Manyoni (365 miles) to Singida (72 miles), and a branch line from Tabora (524 miles) to Mwanza (236 miles) on Lake Victoria.

The principal places in the Territory are connected by telegraph and the system forms a landline communication link between Kenya and Uganda to the north and Nyasaland, Northern
and Southern Rhodesia and the Union of South Africa to the south. Communication with the Belgian Congo is obtained through a non-departmental wireless station at Kigoma.

Dar-es-Salaam is connected by cable with Zanzibar whence communication with all parts of the world may be established.

The main telephone trunk service is between Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Mombasa in Kenya and thence to Nairobi, also in Kenya Colony. Telephonic communication is available to most places in the Tanga and Northern Provinces. There are also trunk lines between Dar-es-Salaam, Morogoro, Kilosa, Dodoma and Tabora, and between Tabora and Mwanza.

A radio-telephone service is available from Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Tabora to the United Kingdom via Nairobi.

Letter and parcel mails to and from overseas countries are despatched as opportunity offers. Regular services have not yet been restored.

There are regular air mail services between the Territory and Great Britain and between the Territory and South Africa and intermediate countries. There are connections at Cairo for services to and from India, Australia and Far East countries and via Great Britain for European countries and America.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Medical Services

Medical headquarters is located at the capital, Dar es Salaam. The administration of the department is carried on through seven provincial medical officers located as a rule at the provincial headquarters. Medical attention is given free to the native population and to Government officials. There are 12 European hospitals and 60 native ones, which include the infectious diseases hospitals at Dar es Salaam and Tanga. Rural medicine is carried on through a chain of dispensaries, the larger number being financed from native treasury funds. There are 43 Government dispensaries and 348 native authority ones. Medical officers of health are maintained in the larger towns; in the smaller towns the duties fall upon the local medical officer. Specialist services are established at Dar es Salaam and include medicine, surgery and ophthalmology. At Kibongoto in the Northern Province there is a special hospital for cases of tuberculosis and at Dodoma and Lutindi (in the Tanga Province) mental hospitals have been established. A specialist in trypanosomiasis is stationed in the Western Province and at Tinde there is an interterritorial research station. Dental surgeons are stationed at Dar es Salaam, Tanga and Tabora.

Medical services are also maintained by many of the missions working in the territory, some of which have built excellent and well-equipped hospitals. These are assisted by grants-in-aid from Government funds. The number of beds in Government hospitals is 3,681, and mission hospitals is 2,344.

A central laboratory exists at Dar es Salaam and smaller ones at most of the provincial headquarter stations.

A medical officer has been seconded to the Labour Department as a specialist in industrial conditions and maintains liaison with that department.

Training of Africans for subordinate medical work, in connection with hospital services is carried on in Dar es Salaam. Schools for rural dispensary services exist at Mwanza and Tukuyu. Training of African nurses both male and female is undertaken in Dar es Salaam and for female African nurses only in Tanga.

Further details are available in the annual reports of the Medical Department.

European Education

Three schools are maintained by Government for the primary education of European children at Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Mbeya (the last two being boarding schools). A correspondence course, which also serves other East African territories, for children in the remoter districts, is conducted from Dar es Salaam. Assistance is given to eight privately maintained schools, one English, two Afrikaans, two Greek, one Goan (44 European children) and two kindergarten schools. The total enrolment is approximately 561 pupils. For secondary education European children proceed to schools in Kenya. Bursaries are awarded for secondary education in Kenya and South Africa.

Indian Education

There are 83 Indian schools with a total enrolment of approximately 9,291 pupils. Grant-in-aid is paid in respect of staff, buildings and equipment. Eighty schools are on the grant-earning list. Forty-one of these are maintained by H.H. Agakhan's Central Council of Education. Thirty-three are so-called Indian public schools (i.e., non-denominational), two are Ithnasheri, two Bohora, one Khalsa Girls' and one Goan school. Instruction in the lower standards is conducted in Gujarati or Urdu, and in the higher standards in English. At the Government school in Dar es Salaam and at two other schools the curriculum is designed to take pupils to the Cambridge School Certificate Examination.
African Education

Schools for Africans are provided by Government, the native administrations and voluntary societies, the two latter being subsidised by a grant-in-aid system controlled by the Education Department. Two hundred and fifty-seven schools are maintained by Government or the native authorities, including eight secondary schools, seven teacher training centres and eight girls' schools (four Government girls' schools having the full primary course with teacher training and four Government girls' village schools). Primary schools are usually co-educational. The total enrolment is approximately 29,298 pupils. Assistance is given to 677 schools including secondary schools, teacher training centres and girls schools run by voluntary agencies. The total roll is approximately 75,404 pupils. In the secondary schools the medium of instruction is English. A few of the schools give a six-years' course at the end of which students may sit for the Makerere College, Uganda, entrance examination. After four years of the secondary course many students enter Government departments where they are given further technical instruction, and some proceed to the clerical course of two years at Tabora secondary school in which boys intended for the local civil service are taught office routine, accountancy, typewriting and shorthand. Two of the teacher training centres train Africans to teach in English in the lower classes of the secondary school; the remainder train vernacular speaking teachers for work in the primary schools. In the primary schools, stress is placed on the improvement of rural economy and nearly every village school has its garden. Industrial sections at the secondary schools teach carpentry, masonry smithing and tailoring. The apprentice section of the Government Printing Press is attached to the Dar es Salaam school.

The total revised estimates of expenditure on education in 1946 was £298,329, exclusive of further sums contributed by the native authorities and voluntary agencies.

The Government publishes a monthly journal in Swahili to disseminate news and useful information among the vernacular speaking population.

Education Department Staff

The European staff of the Education Department includes a director, deputy director, chief inspector, senior education officers, education officers, headmasters, masters, senior women education officers, women education officers, headmistresses, mistresses, matrons, mistress correspondence course, office superintendent, industrial instructors and clerical instructors.

The Indian staff comprises headmasters, inspectors, assistant masters, office assistant and clerks.

There are 758 teachers, industrial instructors and clerks on the African establishment.

Further information is contained in the annual report of the Education Department, 1945.

Inter-Territorial Language (Swahili) Committee

The Inter-territorial Language (Swahili) Committee was established in 1930 for the purpose of the standardization of the Swahili language and the production of literature in a common orthography for text books for the use in Education and other Government departments in all four of the East African Dependencies, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar.

The committee consists of the Director of Education of each territory with one other official and two non-official representatives plus a reader and an officially appointed full-time organizing secretary. With the increasing number of manuscripts and books submitted for publication four African assistant readers were later appointed and added to the membership of the committee.

The organizing secretary is assisted by an office staff of Swahili-speaking personnel, the office as headquarters of the committee being situated at Nairobi, Kenya Colony. The organizing secretary functions as the head of a department and subject to the control of the committee he controls the office and performs the work incidental thereto. For purposes of finance and organization the office and staff are attached to the Secretariat of the East Africa High Commission through which all matters vitally affecting the committee and the Governments concerned are communicated. The Accountant General of such territory in which the office is situated apportions the expenditure amongst the several subscribing Governments.

Labour

The Labour Department consists of four divisions: Labour, Manpower, Civil re-absorption and Training, of which the two latter were formed in 1945 to deal with the demobilisation of African soldiers. The Department is in charge of the Labour Commissioner. The Labour Division has a staff comprising two deputy labour commissioners, a chief factory inspector, a labour and welfare officer (railways), 16 labour officers, an electrical engineer and a medical specialist seconded from the Medical Department. The labour officers are posted at the following places:—Dar es Salaam, Lindi, Tanga, Korogwe, Kilosa, Tabora, Mbeya, Arusha, Moshi, Morogoro, Mwanza, Iringa and Kahama. One officer was on training.

The main employment areas are in the Tanga Province, that part of the Eastern Province bounded by the Central Railway, the Arusha and Moshi districts in the Northern Province, parts of the Southern Highlands Province and the coastal belt of the Lindi and Mikindani districts in the Southern Province. In addition several large mines in the Lake and Western Provinces and in the Chunya district of the Southern Highlands Province employ large labour forces. The Labour Division is responsible for the care of the African labour force in the Territory which amounted to some 342,000 Africans in regular employment in 1945 (no census was taken during 1946).

In addition it maintains the labour camps and shelters for the use of the Africans travelling to and from the main employment areas and in opening labour exchanges in all the more important district headquarters with the object of placing skilled and semi-skilled, both ex-service men and civilians alike, in touch with potential employers.

The Manpower Division has now of course decreased considerably since military operations have come to an end and all the Central civil depots have now been closed. There were 17 civil dispersal officers at the end of the year.

The Training Division, the objects of which are to provide educational training for ex-servicemen and to issue permits of efficiency for skilled and semi-skilled trades. Besides contributing to an inter-territorial "A" centre in Kenya it has its main centre in Dar es Salaam where the technical trades will be taught and the training of rural artisans will be carried out.

**Trade and Customs**

Since 1923 the customs tariff of the Territory has been identical with that in force in Kenya and Uganda and provision was made for the duty-free interchange of all goods grown, produced or manufactured in any one of the three territories. In 1927 the customs management laws of the three territories were co-ordinated, and on 1st August, 1927, effect was given to an agreement under which all goods on which duty had been collected in one of the territories may be transferred to any of the other territories without further formality except the preparation of simple transfer forms, on which inter-territorial adjustments of revenue are subsequently arranged.

The tariff was revised in 1930, being enacted simultaneously in Tanganyika, Kenya and Uganda. The basic fiscal rate is 20 per centum, ad valorem, assessed on the landed value of goods at the port of entry, building materials, artisan's tools and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on a number of items, such as potable spirits, tobacco products and petrol. During 1940-42 there was introduced a system of differential surcharges, varying from 10 per centum upwards, of the customs duties normally payable; these surcharges are still in force. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, insecticides, germicides, and vermin killers, machinery, packing materials and many articles necessary for the agricultural, industrial and educational development of the Territory.

Full particulars of the trade of the Territory will be found in the annual trade report.

**Production and Industry**

**Forestry**

Tanganyika has three natural regions—the coast lowlands, the high plateau and the high mountain slopes around Mount Kilimanjaro and other northern peaks and round Rungwe and the Livingstones in the south. In these regions there are high rainfall areas as also in the foothills of the Ulugurus and Usambaras characterized by the presence of tropical rain-forest. The known total area of forest other than dry zone forest is in the region of 7,000 square miles or just over 2 per cent. of the land area of the territory; of this area 67 per cent. represents forest reserves, 71 per cent. areas awaiting reservation and the balance either native authority forest reserves or areas to which forest rules of some sort apply. The area of the dry forest or myombo has been estimated variously but certainly exceeds 100,000 square miles or very roughly 30 per cent. of the land area. These forests contain some good merchantable timbers in varying quantity, among which camphor, podo, mvule and certain African mahoganies are the most important. In addition valuable species of hardwoods occur as single trees or in groups widely scattered throughout the large areas of savannah forest, chief being muninga and African blackwood. The mangrove woods are valuable as a source of tanning bark and also of poles which are carried by Arab dhows to the Persian Gulf. The possible output of the forests of Tanganyika far exceeds the normal local consumption but wartime demands and the restriction of markets has made such heavy calls on the forest estate that a re-assessment of the position is overdue. The approximate production of timber in 1945, including free issues, was 3.3 million cubic feet, round volume, and of firewood 7.4 million cubic feet, the total value of all being in the region of £875,000.

**Water Development**

The Department was organised for the provision of water supplies other than for township supply (which is undertaken by the Public Works Department), flood control, and control of water power resources within the Territory.

The construction section undertakes the construction of earth dams and river-training works, the installation of pumping machinery and filtration plant and the construction of the tanks in association therewith, for domestic supply and cattle watering.

The water boring section undertakes the location of suitable sites and the drilling of boreholes and the sinking of wells for water supplies whilst affording technical advice to private concerns on the provision of sub-surface supplies.
