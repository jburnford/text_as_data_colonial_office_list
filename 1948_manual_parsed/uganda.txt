UGANDA

SITUATION AND AREA

The territories comprising the Uganda Protectorate are surrounded by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Kenya, Tanganyika Territory, Ruanda-Urundi (under Belgian mandate) and the Belgian Congo. The protectorate extends from about parallel 1° south latitude to the northern limits of the navigable waters of the Albert Nile at Nimule. The eastern boundary runs from Mount Zulia on the Sudan border along the Turkana escarpment to the crater of Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and thence follows the Malawa and the Sio rivers into the north-eastern waters of Lake Victoria. The outstanding features on the western side are the Nile-Congo watershed, Lake Albert, the River Semliki, the Ruwenzori Range (16,794 feet), and Lake Edward. The area of the protectorate is approximately 93,981 square miles, of which 13,680 square miles are water.

CLIMATE

The climate when compared with that of some tropical countries is not unpleasant, but there are parts of the country which are hot and dry and which, for various reasons, are more trying to non-indigenous people. The Nile Valley, which lies about 2,000 feet above sea level, is amongst the hottest parts of the country and is generally less healthy than the higher regions between Lakes Victoria, Albert and Edward. Europeans find the climate congenial in Buganda and the greater part of the western areas, where most of the country is over 4,000 feet above sea level rising to 5,000 feet and over in certain districts. There is perpetual snow on the Ruwenzori Range.

Climatic conditions are not uniform, but, except in the north-east, the climate on the whole is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the 49 years to 1944 at Entebbe being mean maximum, 78·6° F.; mean minimum, 63·7° F. Average daily sunshine 6·12 hours. The lowest rainfall for 1945 was recorded at Kikagati Mine, Ankole (Western province), which registered 22·79 inches, the highest (95·36 inches) being recorded at Lwazimrule Kome Island, Lake Victoria.

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February. The pleasantest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the most trying, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to those immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes are more in evidence and malarial infections more commonly occur.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The protectorate forms part of the central African tableland, the elevation varying from about 3,720 feet above sea level at Lake Victoria to about 3,300 to the west of Hoima and Masindi, where there is a sudden fall of 1,200 feet to Lake Albert. To the north of Lake Albert, 2,028 feet, there is a gradual descent along the valley of the Nile, while Kabale in the extreme south-west is at an altitude of 6,400 feet. Central Uganda is a densely populated country of flattened hills and valleys, lakes and swamps. It is fertile and capable of producing a large variety of crops, chiefly cotton, coffee, sugar, tobacco and rubber. The principal native food crops are plantains, millet and sweet potatoes; maize, rice, sugar-cane, chillies, yams, ground-nuts, sim-sim and a little wheat are also grown. Western Uganda is an elevated, mountainous area, part of which is short grass land, with a healthy climate where European fruits and vegetables can be grown. Big game is plentiful and there are areas of dense forest. North-eastern Uganda, towards the borders of the Sudan, is a dry and arid area, sparsely populated by semi-nomadic tribes.

Uganda is essentially an agricultural country. Except for the Karamojong in the north-east and the Bahima in the short grass lands of the southwest, who live chiefly by cattle raising and trading, the population is almost entirely engaged in agriculture. Cotton lint and cotton seed represent over 80 per cent. of the value of the total exports, and cotton is entirely a native grown crop, so that the agricultural production of the protectorate is almost completely in the hands of African cultivators. There are a few non-native estates, those owned by Europeans being engaged in the production of coffee, rubber, and tea, while the sugar and sisal estates are in the hands of Asians. Alienation of land to non-natives is now almost entirely suspended.

There are indications of the existence of a wide range of minerals including gold, tin, wolfram, tantalite, bismuth, mica, copper, beryl and...
phosphates. There are considerable deposits of salt in the Katwe and Kasenyi crater lakes, and its production and distribution is a long-established native industry.

One hundred and ninety-four cotton ginneries, two sugar factories and a distillery for the manufacture of power alcohol have been established; there are tobacco factories at Kampala and Jinja, and coffee curing factories at Kampala, Masaka and Bubulu. Other industries are as yet in their infancy but the resources of water power in different parts of the protectorate are considerable and will doubtless play their part in the future economic history of the country.

The headquarters of the Uganda administration are at Entebbe, and the chief commercial towns are Kampala and Jinja; all three are on or near the north shore of Lake Victoria and all are supplied with electricity.

No part of the protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Kigezi in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile Valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria can be contracted throughout the year.

With reasonable care, European infants appear to thrive well in the greater part of the country, provided they are kept free from such tropical infections as malaria. Ordinarily European children are not retained longer than over 6 or 7 years of age but this is mainly due to difficulties in respect of schooling.

Sleeping sickness, which proved such a scourge to the country in 1902 and the years following and necessitated the evacuation of the natives from the islands in Lake Victoria, and from the shores of the great lakes and rivers, is now well under control. During 1921 and 1922 the island population was to a great extent restored and many of the islands were successfully reopened. A few cases still occur, usually amongst persons living in contact with tsetse fly.

Active measures against all endemic and epidemic diseases are being taken by the medical and administrative authorities, and the country is rapidly becoming healthier, especially in towns and closely developed areas.

The most important native language is Luganda, belonging to the Bantu group, while Swahili, in a debased form, is widely understood. In the northeast, Nilotic languages are used.

**History**

The countries that now make up the protectorate did not become known to Europe until the journey of Speke and Grant in search of the sources of the Nile. In 1862, coming from the south, they were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala, and were astonished to find themselves among an organised and comparatively civilised people. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages—the discovery of the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864 and Egyptian plans for the annexation of much of present-day Uganda followed. Under such famous governors as Baker, Gordon and Emin, the Egyptian flag flew in the Nile district from 1872 to 1889.

Stanley visited Uganda in 1875 and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa’s dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed in 1879 by French Roman Catholics. Mutesa died in 1884 and was succeeded by his son Mwanga.

Christianity had meanwhile made headway, but Mwanga proved unfavourable to it, and for his father’s tolerance substituted persecution and even massacre of the missionaries’ adherents. In 1888 his people turned on him and he fled to the south of Lake Victoria; but, the Arab traders and native Mohammedans gaining the upper hand, the missionaries and native christians were also driven out. In the same year control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company, and when the Anglo-German agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the company’s influence in Uganda. He found Mwanga recently restored with the help of his fugitive christian subjects, and concluded a treaty with him within a few days of his arrival.

In 1891 Lugard visited the western limits of the British sphere and, at the south end of Lake Albert, found a remnant of Emin’s Egyptian (Sudanese) troops. These he enlisted and brought into Buganda. In January, 1892, soon after his return to Kampala, war broke out between the Protestant and Roman Catholic factions. The latter were defeated and fled taking Mwanga with them. Peace was concluded and Mwanga restored in March, 1892.

Meanwhile the company, crippled by the cost of occupation, gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda, and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future governance. On 1st April, 1893, he assumed on behalf of the British Government the obligations and responsibilities of the company in Buganda and the Union Jack replaced the company’s flag at the fort, which may still be seen on Old Kampala Hill. The formal establishment of a protectorate, but over Mwanga’s kingdom only, was deferred until 18th June, 1894. Meanwhile Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler, Kabarega, driven out. In 1896 the protectorate was extended to most of the other regions, which are now included within the present Uganda, and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory, Mwanga’s kingdom, which is the present Buganda Province, being referred to as Buganda.

In July, 1897, Mwanga fled from his country for the third and last time, and in the following August his infant son, Daudi Chwa, the father of the present Kabaka (or ruler) of Buganda, was proclaimed in his stead. A few months later the very existence of the protectorate was threatened by a mutiny of the Sudanese troops. They occupied Luba’s fort in Busoga and murdered their commander, Captain Thruston. Indian troops were hurried to Uganda but the position was not restored until February, 1898.

Since then there is little but peaceful progress to record. Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government in 1900 as Special Commissioner to settle the country, and concluded an agreement with the Kabaka and people of Buganda, which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown and the ownership of the land. The next year similar agreements were made with the chiefs in Toro and Ankole. Administration has since been extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganised tribes, and the same principles of “indirect rule” have been followed wherever
and whenever it was possible, as in the "agreement districts." In 1903 the eastern highlands of the protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony, and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of frontiers with the Sudan, the Belgian Congo and German East Africa, now the Tanganyika Territory. In 1903 the superintendence of the protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign to the Colonial Office. In the war of 1914-18 the population, of all races, remained devotedly loyal and played a great part in the East African campaign. Since then progress, both material and cultural, has continued. During the second world war Uganda, like other British territories, gave of its best in manpower, money and production in the common war effort.

CONSTITUTION

By the Uganda Order-in-Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, both consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, and the Resident, Buganda (ex-officio members), and such other persons holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such other persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. There are no unofficial members at present, but the appointment of one is under consideration. There is one official member.

It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor, Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture and Director of Education (ex-officio members), with official and unofficial members as in the case of the Executive Council. There are seven unofficial members (two European, two Indian and three African), but this number is shortly to be increased to nine. There is at present one official member.

The Native Government of Buganda has certain rights of internal legislation granted by agreement. The King, or Kabaka, who is accorded the title of "His Highness," rules the Baganda people with the advice of the Governor and of a native council known as the Lukiko, which also has judicial functions.

POPULATION

Estimated population, December, 1945:

| Europeans | Males | 1,477 |
|-----------|-------|-------|
|           | Females | 1,106 |
| Asiatics |       | 28,512 |
| Africans |       | 3,966,595 |
| Total     |       | 3,997,690 |

The African population is divisible into three racial groups—Bantu, Nilotic and Half-Hamite. The most numerous are the Bantu, comprising the Baganda, Bunyoro, Batoro, Banyankole, Basoga, Bachiga and Bagishu and other smaller tribes or sections south and west of the Victoria Nile, and in certain districts in the Eastern Province. To the north and west are the principal Nilotic—the Lango, Acholi, Alur, Lugbara and Madi. The Teso people of the Eastern Province constitute the most important Half-Hamite unit; the others are scattered over a wide area adjacent to Kenya, from the Sudan boundary in the extreme north-east to Mount Elgon. Mention should also be made of the interesting Bahima and the allied peoples of the Western Province. The ruling families of Buganda, Bunyoro, Toro and Ankole are descended from Hima stock.

ADMINISTRATION

The protectorate is divided into four provinces—Buganda, Eastern, Western and Northern. Buganda is on a different footing from the remainder, since, under the 1900 agreement, the King exercises in Buganda direct rule over his people "to whom he shall administer justice through the Lukiko, or native council, and through others of his officers in the manner approved by Her Majesty's Government."

All chiefs are appointed by the Kabaka with the approval of the Governor, and the Kabaka, with the Governor's consent, has the power to make laws governing his people in Buganda.

In other provinces, native administrations are recognised in stages of development varying with the advancement of the tribes. There are native rulers in Ankole, Toro and Bunyoro, each with his council, and native administrations in other districts or tribal areas, the councils being composed of the county chiefs, their sub-chiefs and elders. The councils have no legislative powers, except that, subject to the Governor's consent, they may alter native law by resolution and fix penalties for its breach. The councils are permanently in session to deal with magisterial and routine matters, and submit to the District Commissioner, or to the native ruler, their views on such subjects as:

(a) Proposed alterations to tribal customary law.

(b) Matters affecting the expenditure of native administration funds for the benefit of the tribes.

(c) Agricultural and veterinary development and labour questions.

(d) Food crops and famine.

Estimates are compiled annually for all native administrations and submitted to the Governor for approval.

RELIGION

The Protestant and Roman Catholic churches have been working in the protectorate for over 60 years and now have about one and a quarter million adherents between them. There are also several hundreds of thousands of Muslims. The remainder of the population is pagan at heart, though the desire for education brings many more into the orbit of the missions each year.

The Protestants are represented by the Church Missionary Society, and, to a much smaller degree, by the Seventh Day Adventists and the Salvation Army. The Roman Catholic church is represented by the White Fathers (French), the Verona Mission (Italian) and the Mill Hill Mission (Canadian and Dutch).
CURRENCY AND BANKING

The currency is the same as that of Kenya. Banking facilities are afforded by the National Bank of India, Ltd., with branches at Entebbe, Kampala, and Jinja, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd., with branches at Kampala and Jinja, and Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Kampala and Jinja.

COMMUNICATIONS

Postal

The Uganda Posts and Telegraphs Department is amalgamated with those of Kenya and Tanganyika under the control of the Postmaster-General at Nairobi.

Uganda is in telegraphic communication with Mombasa and Dar-es-Salaam by land lines, and thence by cable with Great Britain and all parts of the world through the system of Cable & Wireless, Ltd., and also by the company's wireless circuit to Great Britain through Nairobi. All important centres within the protectorate are also connected by telegraph. The radio telephone service with the United Kingdom is also available to certain places in Uganda, communication being by trunk land line to Nairobi thence through the wireless channel of Cable and Wireless, Ltd. Radio telegraph stations are operated at Entebbe, Gulu, Kitgum, Moroto and Arua and an Aeradio station with direction-finding facilities is in operation at Entebbe.

For telegraph tariffs within the Empire, see Kenya.

The total mileage of telegraph and telephone pole route at the end of 1946 was 1,631 and the wire mileage 7,210. Telephone exchanges connected with the main Uganda trunk system are worked at Bombo, Busembatia, Busia, Entebbe, Iganga, Jinja, Kaliro, Kampala, Kamuli, Lugazi, Masaka, Mbale, Mpigi and Tororo. Other telephone exchanges at which the trunk service is restricted to certain offices exist at Bukakata, Butiaba, Fort Portal, Hoima, Masindi, Masindi Port, Mbarara, Mubende, Namasagali and Soroti.

1,917 telephones were in service in Uganda at the end of 1946.

There are regular air-mail services between the Protectorate and Great Britain and between the Protectorate and South Africa and intermediate countries. There are connections at Cairo for services to and from India, Australia and Far East countries and via Great Britain for European countries and America.

Railways

The protectorate is separated by about 500 miles from the nearest point on the east coast of Africa. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the colony of Kenya, transport was exceedingly difficult before the construction of the "Uganda Railway" from Mombasa to the northeast corner of Lake Victoria, which the Imperial Government decided in 1895 to undertake. This railway at the end of 1901 had covered the whole 584 miles separating Mombasa from Kisumu on Victoria Nyanza, which was the terminus of the railway until recent years.

There is a lake steamer service connecting Entebbe, Port Bell (Kampala), with Kisumu and the other ports on Lake Victoria. Steamers ply also on Lake Kioga and on Lake Albert (connected by a road service), and on the Albert Nile as far north as Nimule. All these services are maintained by the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours Administration.

A railway, 62 miles long, from Jinja to Namasagali on the Victoria Nile, giving access to the waterways of Lake Kioga, was completed in 1912, and one from Port Bell on Lake Victoria to Kampala, a distance of 7½ miles, was opened for public traffic in 1915.

Since the 1914-18 war considerable railway development has taken place, and the main line of the Kenya and Uganda railway, leaving the original line at Nakuru, now extends into the Eastern Province of Uganda to join the Jinja-Namasagali railway at Mbulamuti, and so places Uganda in direct communication with the coast. An extension of this line from Tororo, near the Kenya border, to Mbale and Soroti was completed in 1929, and the linking up of Jinja with Kampala—a scheme which involved the bridging of the Victoria Nile at the former place—was completed in the early part of 1931.

Roads

The system of all-weather main roads radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres is maintained by the Public Works Department, which has a road mileage of 2,273 under its control. A system of roads in the Western Province establishes connection between the tin mines and the Kagera River steamship service, taps the resources of the Rutshuru area of the Belgian Congo for that service, and links up direct the district headquarters in the west of the protectorate. About 5,327 miles of excellent roads are also kept up by the native administrations. Motor transport, in consequence of these facilities, has reached an advanced stage of development in the protectorate.

Air Services

Landing grounds are kept up at Entebbe, Tororo, Masindi, Gulu, Soroti, Lira, Arua and Moroto. Landing facilities for seaplanes exist at Entebbe and Port Bell. There is no accommodation in Uganda for housing aircraft.

The Cairo to South Africa mail and passenger service of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, is operated by flying boats which call twice weekly at Port Bell for Kampala on both northward and southward journeys. In addition a service of land machines has been recently instituted calling at Nairobi, and there is a thrice weekly local air service from Entebbe to Nairobi, calling at Kisumu and connecting Uganda with the air services in neighbouring territories.

SOCIAL SERVICES

Medical

Large African, Asian and European hospitals are provided by Government in Kampala, the commercial capital of the protectorate.

Medical officers are stationed in every district headquarters and have charge of a hospital and a chain of dispensaries and aid posts, situated in the more densely populated areas. These subsidiary centres are regularly visited by the medical officers.

Nursing sisters are attached to most of the district hospitals, and, in addition to tutorial and supervisory duties, conduct ante-natal and child welfare clinics at regular intervals in the larger dispensaries.

Hospital accommodation in most districts has been considerably improved in recent years.

There is a full time medical officer of health in Kampala. Responsibility for public health is vested in the medical officer in each district, assisted in some of the more populous areas by a health inspector.
Schools for the training of Africans as assistant medical officers, assistant health inspectors, medical assistants, dispensers and nurses are attached to the African hospital in Kampala. Midwives are trained at Namirembe and Nsambya Missions, which are situated near Kampala. Two training centres at Lira in the Northern Province and Masaka in Buganda train ex-service men as nursing orderlies, selected men being allowed to qualify as medical assistants. Ex-army men are also trained as hygiene orderlies at Mbale, in the Eastern Province. The further extension of training facilities for nurses is contemplated in the immediate future.

**Education**

Education was at first entirely and still is mainly in the hands of the various missionary societies, who receive grants from the Protectorate Government. Their efforts have, for some years past, been supplemented by Government. The total Protectorate Government grants to African education in 1946 were £237,574. The total number attending schools in 1946 was approximately 288,000, of whom roughly 137,000 were within the aided system; the total Government expenditure on education in 1946 was £305,939. Makerere College, Kampala, is an East African institute for higher education, moving towards university status. It is an inter-territorial foundation, in whose support and direction all the East African Governments take part.

**Public Relations and Social Welfare**

A Department of Public Relations and Social Welfare was set up at the end of 1946 as part of the plans for post-war development in the territory.

Since its inception the department has initiated the following projects and activities:

Two official bulletins (one in Luganda, Lutoro, and English and the other in Gang, Ateso, Swahili and English) are circulated throughout the territory. These bulletins have a total circulation of 23,000 which will be increased as soon as a freer supply of newsprint becomes available.

The presentation and the release of departmental news to the European and the vernacular press is undertaken as a routine service, as is the supply of news-items to overseas and East African journals.

A press club has been started in Kampala for the use of vernacular editors, where meetings with P.R.O. officials are held weekly for informal discussion.

Four propaganda teams, one serving each province, are constantly touring the territory, presenting to the people progressive ideas concerning all aspects of social, economic, and cultural life. A mobile cinema van showing sub-standard propaganda films is attached to each of two of the units. Further cinema vans are on order.

A series of lectures by senior Government officials to explain Government to the people, and Government's plans and projects for the future, has been inaugurated for English-speaking Africans, together with cinema shows to vary the programme.

Further information regarding social services may be found in the annual report of the colony and in the annual departmental reports.

**PUBLIC REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE**

The revenue is principally derived from income tax, poll taxes, customs and excise duties, cotton and coffee taxes, trading licences and land rents. The revenue from income tax in 1945 was £291,373, from poll taxes £633,861, and from customs and excise duties £1,045,690. There has been no grant-in-aid from the British Government since 1914–15. The Uganda Loan, 1932 (£2,235,600), was floated in January, 1932, and Uganda Loan, 1937 (£614,400), was floated in April, 1939. The unit of currency is the East African shilling.
