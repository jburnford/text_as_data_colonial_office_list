* FEDERATION OF MALAYA

SITUATION AND AREA

The territories comprising the Federation of Malaya are situated in the southern section of the Kra Peninsula which protrudes at the southeastern corner of Asia between India and China, between latitudes 1° and 7° N. and longitudes 100° and 105° E. The Federation covers an area of approximately 50,850 square miles, rather more than twice the size of the island of Ceylon and slightly larger than England without Wales. The largest of its territories is the State of Pahang, which is twice the area of Lancashire and Yorkshire combined and the smallest is the State of Perlis which is about twice the size of Rutland.

The State of Perlis lies on the north-west coast of the Peninsula and is bounded by a range of mountains running north and south which separates it from the Siamese province of Setul. On the east the boundary is with the Siamese province of Nakon Sridhammaraj and the Malay State of Kedah, which is bordered on the interior by the Siamese States of Songkhla and Patani and by the State of Perak. The Muda River separates it from Province Wellesley.

The State of Perak stretches south from Province Wellesley, Kedah and Siam and is separated from Kelantan and Pahang on the east by the main range of mountains that form the backbone of the Peninsula. On the south, the Bernam River separates the State from Selangor, which is bordered on the east by the State of Pahang and on the south by the State of Negri Sembilan.

Stretching north on the east coast between the northern border of Pahang and the Siamese boundary lie the two States of Trengganu and Kelantan.

In the extreme south of the Malay Peninsula lies the State of Johore. Four-fifths of the surface of the Peninsula is covered by dense tropical jungle. The only generally cleared parts of the country are the long stretches down the west coast, an area in the north and a number of open stretches up the principal rivers. The State of Trengganu, for example, is divided into sixteen river basins all of which empty into the China Sea.

CLIMATE

The principal features of the Malayan climate are copious rainfall, high humidity and a uniformity of temperature which rarely varies during the day more than fifteen degrees. There are no well-defined divisions between the seasons which are marked by the breaking and closing of the south-west and north-east monsoons, the latter of which occurs in the season which corresponds with the winter in the northern latitudes. Although there are two recognised rainy seasons between June and December, and in March and April, during the last 70 years most calendar months have at one time or another been recorded as witnessing the highest annual rainfall of some specific year.

The average monthly rainfall for 1946 was 8.74 inches. The average maximum temperature on the plains was 88.2° and the average minimum was 72.7°. At the hill stations conditions are somewhat different. Uniformity of temperature still obtains, but the highest temperature recorded at Fraser’s Hill (4,200 feet) is 81° F. and at Tanah Rata (4,750 feet) 79° F. The coolest night temperature recorded at Fraser’s Hill is 53° F. and at Tanah Rata, 36° F., only 4° above freezing point.

However relaxing may be the humid monotony of the perpetual summer’s afternoon which is the Malayan climate, it has the redeeming feature of a cool and not infrequently chilly night which is denied those who live in the greater tropical land masses during the warmer seasons.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Kra Peninsula is divided by mountain ranges the principal trend of which is north and south. The centre of the Peninsula is a series of parallel ridges separated by strips of low country while to the east and west of the outside ranges are the coastal plains which are mainly alluvial and in the south a region of low land. Approximately 80 per cent. of the whole area remains under primeval jungle, mountain, or swamp, 14 per cent. under rubber, 2.4 per cent. under padi and 2.1 per cent. under coconuts and oil palms.

The Malay rivers at their sources and in their upper reaches are quick flowing, often with tortuous rapids and precipitous gorges.

In the lower reaches, the descent is more gradual and the water takes on a muddy hue from contamination with the silt of the plains through which they meander, debouching ultimately through strips of mangrove swamp, particularly on the west coast.

The two principal rivers of the Peninsula are the Perak and the Pahang, the latter being some ten miles shorter than the River Thames. It springs in the main range of mountains, the highest of which is Gunong Tahan which rises to over 7,000 feet at its summit. This and other peaks constitute some of the highest territory south of the Himalayas, while there are half a dozen promenencies which would comfortably overshadow Ben Nevis. That part of the country free from the torrid luxuriance of forest and jungle has been developed into great rice-producing areas as in the alluvial plains of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. Other stretches have been scarred by the incisions of industry as in the Kinta Valley of Perak, which opens out into a monotonous prospect of silver-grey silt, the residuum of tin extraction.

The coast-line of the Malay Peninsula extends to over 1,000 miles; on the west a practically unbroken succession of mangrove and mud flat with infrequent indentations of picturesque bays fringed with coconut palms and the graceful spires of the casuarina. On the east coast there are long unbroken stretches of sand and surf bordered by a littoral vegetation which lends to it a beauty possibly unparalleled in the tropics.

Within the territorial waters lie the Langkawi Islands off the North Kedah coast rising to over 2,000 feet wrapped in wild and rugged beauty. Farther south there is the island of Penang, picturesque in a different way, whose features...
have been eulogised by travellers from the earliest histories. The island of Pangkor off the coast of Perak was once a Dutch settlement but little remains in evidence of this history beneath the vegetation which has long since reclaimed its own.

Finally, off the east coast among a sprinkle of beautiful islands there is Tioman with its symbolic silhouette of granite peaks.

**History**

European power in Malaya may be dated from 1511, when a Portuguese fleet captured Malacca; it succeeded to periods of Indian and Islamic influence. Indian traders from the Coromandel coast, arriving in the Peninsula in about the first century A.D., found the aboriginal inhabitants living by fishing and the most primitive agriculture. The Indians, beginning to settle in the country and intermarry with the aborigines, built the first towns; the chief one, which stood on the River Merbok in Kedah, was known in Malay records as Langkasuka. Eventually there emerged an Indo-Malayan kingdom called Sri-Vijaya, of which the capital was at one time at Palembang in Sumatra, but may later have been at Langkasuka. This Indian influence, which had replaced the aboriginal tribal organisation by the rule of Rajas, had disseminated Buddhism, and had added to the Malay language a large number of Sanskrit words, together with the Indian alphabets, lasted until about the fifteenth century, when Muslim missionaries began to undermine it. Indians, Persians and Arabians, they had come to Sumatra a century earlier, and soon spread to the Peninsula. By the seventeenth century Indian culture and religion had yielded to those of Islam; the Arabic alphabet was introduced, Arabic words came into the language, and Indian aesthetics gave place to Muslim austerity. A great part in this process was played by Iskander Muda, Sultan of Aceh in northern Sumatra, whose piratical hordes swept through Malaya, massacring and pillaging, and at the same time compelling conversion to Islam at the point of the sword. Meanwhile European power was beginning. The Portuguese in Malacca succeeded a Malay kingdom which, founded by a dispossessed ruler of Tumasik (the modern Singapore), had extended its sway over much of the peninsula. They held Malacca from 1511 to 1641, when they were dispossessed by the Dutch. The Portuguese were crusaders even more than traders, and made themselves detested by the Malays by their compulsory conversions to Christianity. In contrast, the Dutch concerned themselves almost entirely with trade during their 150 years of rule in Malacca, jealously guarding their monopoly of the tin and spice trades. But neither the Portuguese nor the Dutch extended their rule beyond the town of Malacca. It was to break the Dutch trading monopoly that the British first settled in Malaya. Francis Light, in 1786, obtained for the East India Company a grant of the almost uninhabited island of Penang, and in 1800 Province Wellesley was added. Malacca came into British hands in 1795, during the Napoleonic wars; it served as a base for the successful attack on Dutch Java by Lord Minto and Sir Stamford Raffles. Raffles became Lieutenant-Governor of Java; but in 1814 Java and Malacca alike were handed back to the Dutch. Raffles, with his far-seeing vision, held this to be a grave mistake, and by continued representations to the company secured permission to look for a site on which to build up a new trading centre as a rival to Malacca. His choice fell on the island where, four centuries before, had flourished the Malay city and port of Tumasik or Singapura, which after its sack in 1377 had disappeared from history. He obtained a concession from the Malay ruler of Riau-Johore, and on 29th January, 1819, the Union Jack was hoisted. Raffles' vision was proved not only by his choice of a site, but by his determination to make it a free port; with these two advantages Singapore at once began its phenomenal development as centre of the entrepôt trade. Malacca returned to British hands as the third of the Straits Settlements in 1824, when by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of London Malaya was recognised as a British sphere of influence. Raffles strongly favoured British expansion in Malaya; but after his early death in 1826 the parsimonious conservatism of the East India Company frowned on such a policy. However, in 1858 the Straits Settlements came under the control of the India Office, and in 1867 of the Colonial Office, while such factors as the danger to the British position latent in the huge concessions of land granted at this time by the Sultans to Europeans and others, the growing interest in the tin, and subsequently rubber, which could be obtained from Malaya, and a deterioration of the political situation of the Malay States into civil war and disorder, hastened the extension of British authority in the Peninsula. In 1873 Sir Andrew Clarke, the new Governor of the Straits, came out with authority for more active intervention. The first result was the treaty of Pangkor with Perak in 1874, and in the next decade there followed agreements with Selangor, with the States of Negri Sembilan, and with Pahang. In 1909 Siam, after long negotiations, transferred to Great Britain her rights in the northern states, and there resulted agreements in the same year with Kedah, Kelantan and Perlis, and in 1919 with Trengganu. Relations with Johore were regulated by a treaty made in 1914. All these treaties were in their main features similar: the Malay States agreed to accept British protection and to have no dealings with foreign powers except through Great Britain, and were in return guaranteed protection against attack by foreign powers; to each state a British officer was appointed as resident or adviser, whose advice the rulers agreed to follow on all matters except those of the Muslim religion or Malay custom. The early residents were faced with great difficulties. The new methods of raising revenue which became necessary to finance the development of the country aroused great hostility, to which the forbidding of slavery and of forced labour added. There were risings in Perak in 1874 and in Pahang in 1891-1892. In time, however, the residents, by patience and conciliation, overcame these difficulties; and the foundations laid by such early residents as Sir Hugh Low and Sir Frank Swettenham made possible the great economic development of this century, when European and Chinese capital built up the rubber and tin industries and made of Malaya one of the most prosperous territories of the Colonial Empire. Politically, the main change in the early years of the century was the formation of the Federated Malay States. Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan and Pahang became a federation with a resident general as chief executive officer, and a system of centralised government was inaugurated which lasted in varying forms until 1932. In that year there was a measure of decentralisation; legislative powers were to some extent restored to the states and the authority of the rulers and residents was reinforced.
Progress and prosperity in Malaya were brought to an abrupt halt by the Japanese invasion in December, 1941. The severity of the Japanese occupation is well known; in addition, malnutrition and disease were widespread, while industries decayed and plantations became overgrown with the jungle. This state of affairs is only now being remedied as a result of the efforts of the two years which have elapsed since the liberation of Malaya in August, 1945.

The Federation of Malaya, which was established on 1st February, 1948, comprises the nine Malay States of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Selangor and Trengganu, with the British Settlements of Penang (and Province Wellesley) and Malacca.

**CONSTITUTION**

During the period of British military administration Sir Harold MacMichael negotiated with Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers new agreements under which they transferred full sovereignty and jurisdiction to His Majesty the King, thereby opening the way for the establishment of the Malayan Union by Order in Council on 1st April, 1946. It had been planned at the same time to establish a form of common citizenship, but, in view of the strong objections put forward by the Malays to the form of these proposals, the Order in Council which would have given effect to them was not made. The Malays also objected to the transfer of sovereignty, and feared domination by the non-Malay communities as a result of the proposed new citizenship. On 25th July, 1946, a working committee, consisting of representatives of Government, of Their Highnesses the Rulers, and of the United Malays' National Organisation, was appointed to submit agreed views, if possible, for both sides to examine and criticise. Its Report, published in December, 1946, recommended a federation in which each state and settlement would retain its individuality under a strong central government; and qualifications for a form of common citizenship. These proposals received the conditional approval of His Majesty's Government on 11th December, 1946.

To enable all interested communities to have free and full opportunity of expressing their views a Consultative Committee was appointed, composed mainly of influential members of the non-Malay communities. After receiving oral and written representations throughout the country the Consultative Committee published its report on 31st March, 1947. After further discussion with Their Highnesses the Rulers and the representatives of U.M.N.O., the scheme which finally emerged, and which followed in the main that proposed in December, 1946, although differing on several important points of detail, was finally accepted by His Majesty's Government in July, 1947, when its main features were summarised in a White Paper (Cmd. 7171). The signature of agreements between His Majesty and each Malay Ruler, and of a Federation Agreement to embrace the arrangements as a whole followed on 21st January, 1948, and the new Constitution came into force on 1st February, 1948.

By the State Agreements, the Rulers are confirmed in their former powers, but undertake to govern under written constitutions. A Conference of Rulers is to be consulted on matters of special concern to the Malay States, and in particular, on immigration policy.

The Central Government, which was set up under the Federation Agreement, and to which legislation on matters of importance to the whole country is reserved, consists of a High Commissioner appointed by His Majesty, a Federal Executive Council, and a Federal Legislative Council. The Legislative Council consists of 75 members: 14 official and *ex officio*, the 9 Menri Besar or chief ministers of the Malay States, 2 representing the Settlement Councils, and 50 unofficial, these last nominated on a mainly non-racial basis to represent important vocations and interests. The new provisions concerning citizenship are summarized in Cmd. 7171.

The Federation Agreement also records the desire of His Majesty and Their Highnesses the Rulers that progress shall be made towards self-government, and their agreement that, as a first step to this end, legislation shall be introduced as soon as circumstances permit for the election of members to the several legislatures established under the Agreement.

**POPULATION**

The last census of Malaya was taken in 1931 and the population of the territories comprising the Federation was returned at 3,876,262, but by mid-1941 the population, based on figures of births, deaths and migration since 1931, was estimated to be 4,739,515. During the Japanese occupation the military authorities took eight censuses, none of which can be regarded as complete. Until the figures of the census (which it is proposed to take in 1947) are published it will not be possible to present a true picture, but the best available estimate places the population of the territories at the end of 1946 at around 5,250,000, giving a mean density of approximately 103 to the square mile.

The 1941 population was made up as follows:

| Group       | Population |
|-------------|------------|
| Malaysians   | 2,200,121  |
| Chinese     | 1,778,331  |
| Indians     | 684,364    |
| Europeans   | 16,781     |
| Eurasians   | 11,000     |
| Others      | 48,918     |
| **Total**   | **4,739,515** |

**ADMINISTRATION**

Under the Federal constitution the executive authority in each State is vested in the Ruler, who is aided and advised by his Executive Council; it extends to all matters not included in the Federal legislative list. The Councils of State and the Settlement Councils have legislative powers in such matters as are not reserved for the Federal authority. The Federal estimates provide separately for the income and expenditure of each of the States and Settlements, and for block grants from Federal revenue to make up the deficiency of their own revenues.

The seat of the Central government is at Kuala Lumpur, capital of the former Federated Malay States; it is the headquarters of most Government departments and of the military Malaya Command. In each State there is a British adviser as adviser to the Government; and officers of the various Federal departments who, while being directly responsible to the heads of their own departments, work closely with the British Adviser and officers in the districts. Most of the administrative and departmental officers in districts are Asiatics educated and trained in Malaya.
RELIGION

The Muslim religion is practised by the Malays, who are Sunni Muslims of the Shafi'i School. The Malay Rulers are the titular religious heads of their Muslim subjects in each State. The Muslim community also includes a number of the local Indian population and a lesser number of persons of other races.

There are Christian churches in most of the larger towns of Malaya and the Christian community includes an appreciable number of local Asians.

Hinduism is the religion of the majority of the Indian labourers and of a large number of the local Indian population of all classes, including the Chettiaris.

Buddhism is practised by a section of the Chinese and Indian communities and by the small Siamese groups. The Sikh community follow the religious belief of that name.

Amongst the Chinese population may be found a variety of beliefs which include Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, with the addition of the worship of a number of local deities.

Little is known of the beliefs of the primitive aboriginal tribes of the interior, but they are said to practise forms of Shamanism and Animism.

CURRENCY AND BANKING

The standard currency of Malaya is the Malayan dollar with a value of two shillings and fourpence and divided into one hundred cents. The currency is issued by a Board of Commissioners of Currency which was established under an agreement signed in 1938 by the governments of the Straits Settlements and the Malay States. The agreement placed the currency of the country on a sterling exchange standard and the commissioners are bound to issue on demand currency notes to the equivalent at the rate of one dollar for two shillings and fourpence of sums in sterling lodged with the Crown Agents in London, and to pay on demand the sterling equivalent of Malayan currency notes lodged with them in Malaya. Under the law the commissioners can charge commission at the rate of three-sixteenths of a penny for every dollar issued and one farthing in respect of every dollar received.

Provision is made for the establishment and maintenance of a currency fund in such a way that its value shall stand at one hundred and ten per cent. of the face value of the currency notes and coin in circulation. There is also provision for making each Government liable to meet any deficiency in the fund should the assets at any time prove inadequate to meet legal demands upon the currency commissioners for the conversion of currency into sterling.

The Currency (Transitional Amendment) Ordinance, 1946, which came into force on 1st April, appointed the Financial Secretary of the Malayan Union (as it was then called) and the Financial Secretary, Singapore, to be the Board of Commissioners of Currency for Malaya.

The position of the note circulation at 31st December is summarized in the following table:

| Circulation as at 15.2.42 | $221,974,005.30 |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| Less notes destroyed or awaiting destruction by Currency Commissioners | $65,113,301.80 |
| Notes issued since the liberation | $156,860,703.50 |
| Note circulation at 31.12.46 | $387,786,252.29 |

It should be noted that the figure for February, 1942, is the total nominal circulation as at the 15th of that month and it is impossible to estimate what proportion of the amount has been lost or destroyed, in the hands of the public or exported since that date.

In comparing the pre-occupation with the present position it is necessary to take into account the fact that the Malayan dollar is replacing the old British North Borneo and Sarawak currencies. Partly due to this reason, but also to the heavy net inward remittances to meet rehabilitation and Government deficit expenditure, the note circulation increased in the nine months under review by approximately $6,500,000.

There has been a currency exchange office in Kuala Lumpur since 1st July, 1923. The functions of this office are briefly to:

(a) issue to banks in Kuala Lumpur new notes or silver or copper coins in exchange for old notes paid in to the exchange office in Kuala Lumpur;

(b) arrange telegraphic transfers via Singapore Treasury to banks in Singapore in exchange for old notes paid in by Kuala Lumpur banks to the exchange office in Kuala Lumpur;

(c) issue to banks in Kuala Lumpur new notes against telegraphic transfers via the Singapore Treasury from banks in Singapore;

(d) exchange old notes and coins for the public generally.

Foreign Exchange Control had been inaugurated in the Malayan Union on 4th January, 1946, in conformity with the system already in force throughout the sterling area (or "scheduled territories" as they are now known).

The feature of exchange control in this country is the system of allowing remittances by Chinese up to a limit of $45 per month for the maintenance of their families in China. This system is operated through remittance "chops" who undertake to collect money, write letters from the remitter to beneficiary, and through his agent in China deliver the money, write the acknowledgment at the dictation of the beneficiary, and deliver the reply. This concession represents a considerable export of resources to China for which, from a foreign exchange viewpoint, no consideration is received in return.

Another aspect which is of interest is the trade carried on between Malaya on the one hand and Sumatra, Siam, China and the adjacent islands on the other. This trade is known as the "chinchev" trade and is a very important one in normal times but during the period under review, owing to the difficulties—political and otherwise in Sumatra—it has been restricted. The system operates in the following manner:

A chinchev trader exports by tongkang to an adjacent territory a cargo of Malayan goods and brings back a cargo of approximate equivalent value of local produce. Alternatively, he may take with him a certain amount of Malayan money to territories in which Malayan currency circulates and purchase local produce which he brings to this country—sells—and buys local produce acceptable in adjacent territories. This trade is controlled to ensure that the value of the trade in either direction is approximately equal.
The following banks operate in the Federation:

- The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China.
- The Mercantile Bank of India.
- The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.
- The Kwong Yik Banking Corporation.
- The Overseas Chinese Bank.
- The Bank of China.
- The Ban Hin Lee Bank.
- The Oriental Bank of Malaya.
- The Chettinad Bank.
- The Indian Overseas Bank.
- The Indian Bank.
- The M. C. M. Banking Corporation.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

**Roads**

There are about 6,000 miles of road, of which about 4,000 are bitumenised. In 1941 they provided efficient communication between all parts of Malaya, but the lack of maintenance during the Japanese occupation, and the destruction of hundreds of bridges, have seriously impaired the efficiency of the system. Repair work is being pressed ahead, and bridges are being replaced, in many cases by the military Bailey bridge. There was also at the liberation a great shortage of road vehicles, both goods and passenger-carrying; but by the end of 1946, chiefly as the result of repairs of vehicles abandoned by the Japanese, as many were on the roads as before the occupation, and bus services were operated over 5,000 miles of road.

**Rail**

The Malayan Railway, formerly the Federated Malay States Railway, is owned by the Government. There are two main lines, running from Singapore in the south to the Siamese border and connecting with the Royal State Railways of Siam. The west coast line is the more important, having branches to ports at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson and Port Weld, and a terminus at Prai, opposite Penang Island. The east coast line was taken up by the Japanese, the materials being used on the notorious Burma-Siam railway. It is not yet completely restored; rail connection between Kelantan and the west coast must be made by way of Siam. Many locomotives and much rolling-stock had been destroyed, and more removed by the Japanese to Siam and Burma; and the workshops at Sentul had been largely destroyed by allied bombing. All this, together with the dilapidation of permanent way and signalling system, has delayed the restoration of pre-war standards, when the railway provided comfortable and efficient travel with air-conditioned coaches, restaurant and sleeping-cars. However, with the progress of reconstruction, and the arrival of new equipment from overseas, there has been steady improvement in both passenger and goods traffic.

**Posts and Telephones**

The former postal services of the various states have been unified in the postal services department, and all pre-war facilities have been restored; there is rapid and reliable delivery all over the Peninsula. The telecommunications department is now operated separately; it provides a telegraphic service all over the country, while there are nearly 200 telephone exchanges, with trunk routes to connect them. Large-scale developments are to be made when new equipment is available.

**Broadcasting**

It is intended eventually to serve every part of the Peninsula with two simultaneous programmes, using the English, Malay, Chinese and Tamil languages. This aim is at present only partly achieved, but news bulletins, talks and varied entertainment programmes are broadcast from the main centres of population.

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Although the Japanese took over many schools for use as barracks or stores, and perverted those that remained to mere centres of propaganda, the total number of pupils attending schools in the Federation is now greater than it was before the war. Primary education is given in Malay, Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools, of which there are nearly 3,000, as well as in a few using other languages. In the Malay schools, no fees are charged and attendance is in most areas compulsory for boys; among girls, too, there is great keenness for education, and the number of girls attending school increases constantly. Chinese schools are mainly run by committees of the Chinese community, education following traditional Chinese lines. It is estimated that 60 per cent. of Chinese children attend them. Indian schools are mostly on the estates, supervised by the estate managers. Both Chinese and Indian schools are visited by Government inspectors, who report whether they are of the standard of efficiency required to qualify them for a Government grant.

English schools are mostly secondary in scope, although many have primary schools attached. Pupils of all races are admitted, either direct or from vernacular schools, in many cases without fees being required, and receive education up to school certificate standard. The Malay College at Kuala Kangsar, a boarding-school for up to 140 selected Malay boys, is also of secondary standard.

Higher education for Malaya is provided by Raffles College and the King Edward VII College of Medicine, both at Singapore, while scholarships are available for students who wish to study in the United Kingdom. In the Federation, the Technical College at Kuala Lumpur provides training in engineering, and the School of Agriculture at Serdang in agriculture, with special reference to local problems. The Sultan Idris Training College and the Malay Women's Training College train Malay teachers; further training schemes are being initiated to relieve the serious shortage of teachers.

**Health**

At the liberation, a great deterioration in public health and hygiene was evident. Anti-malarial work, such as ditching and oil-spreading, had been neglected, sanitation had reverted to a primitive level, hospitals had been looted or destroyed, and both doctors and drugs were lacking. Malnutrition was universal and, largely in consequence, there had been a grave increase in disease: chiefly, as was to be expected, in malaria, but also in pulmonary tuberculosis, typhus, beri-beri, yaws, and other diseases. The efforts of the health service have been directed towards checking these diseases and the conditions which give rise to them. Anti-malarial measures received particular attention; drainage and sewage disposal has been largely restored to the former high effectiveness; food shops have been inspected and buildings which infringed the health
regulations visited. The larger towns are supplied with purified water through pipes; wells in the country are treated with alum, chlorinated, or filtered. Sixty-three general hospitals, in which 13,375 beds were available, are maintained by Government, as well as institutions for lepers, mental patients and those suffering from infectious diseases. More than 150,000 patients were treated in 1946. There are also dispensaries, both fixed and travelling, and dental centres. Child welfare centres are established all over the country; and trained midwives practice in their own villages. A wide range of special problems is investigated by the Institute of Medical Research.

Labour

It was not until June, 1941, that the first trade union legislation in Malaya took effect, and by the time of the Japanese invasion no unions had applied to be registered. At the liberation, it became clear that the idea of organisation had taken root, but also that it was not growing on the most desirable lines. While many unions were appearing, they were often formed solely to press one particular dispute, on the solution of which they would dissolve. To encourage a stable and healthy growth of unionism, a trade union adviser was appointed, with the task of advising new unions on their constitution and procedure. The registration of unions was carried forward under the pre-war enactment. At the beginning of 1947, applications for registration had been received from 276 workers' unions and eight employers' unions; most of them had already been approved.

Finance

The estimates for the period 1st April to 31st December, 1946, are summarized as below:

| Revenue | $107,898,520 |
|---------|--------------|
| Recurrent expenditure: |
| Personal Emoluments | $43,868,017 |
| Other charges | $64,130,448 |
| Total | $107,998,465 |
| Deficit | $99,945 |
| Extraordinary expenditure | $126,354,071 |
| Total deficit | $126,454,016 |

These estimates excluded the revenue of the Malayan Railways, but provision was made under expenditure to meet the deficit on the railway budget estimated at $37,740,000.

The actual revenue and expenditure for the period 1st April to 31st December, 1946, was as follows:

| Revenue | $129,727,814 |
| Expenditure | $234,352,536 |

The estimates for the last nine months of 1946 are the first consolidated estimates ever produced for the territories comprising the Federation, and it is not easy to find a basis of comparison between these estimates and the pre-occupation position. In view of the degree of guess-work involved in the figures and the necessity of creating new and in many cases temporary departments, any detailed comparison of the 1946 with the 1941 position would tend to be misleading. It can, however, be recorded that, on the basis of 30 per cent. of the revenue and expenditure of the old Straits Settlements being regarded as appropriate to the Federation, the approximate budget position for the full year in 1941 was as follows:

| Revenue | $137.1 |
| Recurrent expenditure: |
| Personal emoluments | $49.7 |
| Other charges | $51.3 |
| Surplus | $101.0 |
| Extraordinary expenditure | $36.1 |
| Deficit | $2.1 |

The total amount of the public debt at the end of 1946 was $153,384,268.

Trade

The following table shows the declared value of imports and exports for the six months 1st July to 31st December, 1946:

| Imports | Per cent. |
|---------|-----------|
| From Singapore | $114,920,920 | 51.95 |
| United Kingdom | $23,883,206 | 10.80 |
| Other British Countries | $26,652,604 | 12.05 |
| Foreign Countries | $55,747,307 | 25.20 |
| Total | $221,204,037 |

| Exports | |
|---------|-----------|
