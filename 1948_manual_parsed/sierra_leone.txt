SIERRA LEONE

SITUATION AND AREA

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,925 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 55' and 10° of N. latitude, and 10° 16' and 13° 18' of W. longitude. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at 9° 2' on the border of French Guinea, to the Mano River at latitude 6° 55' N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The colony portion of this area, i.e., the territories acquired by the Crown by treaty of cession or otherwise consists of the following—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbro Island, the Tasso, Banana, Turtle, Plantain and York Islands and other small islets, the Bake Loke, Maforki and part of the Bure Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro-Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timdel, Bendu, Cha, Nonkoba Bullom, Messi Krim, and part of the Mano Sakrim Chiefdoms in the South Western Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasso Island, Banana Islands, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as if they were within the Protectorate.
CLIMATE

The seasons may be divided into wet and dry, the former commencing in May and lasting till October. The shade temperature varies during the year from about 62° to 97°. Tornadoes or violent thunderstorms occur at the commencement and close of the rainy season. They are accompanied by strong wind, but do not last long, and seldom do much damage. The atmosphere during the rainy season is excessively damp. The rainfall in Freetown in 1946 was 132-65 inches. Between the months of December and March the wind known as the "Harmattan" is prevalent; it is very dry, and often brings with it a fine dust said to come from the Sahara. Its direction ranges from north-east to south-east.

The climate of Sierra Leone, as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, is trying, but conditions have been greatly improved in recent years through the efforts of the medical and sanitary services, and if ordinary precautions are taken the risk of contracting malarial fever can be much reduced. In the Freetown area in particular the incidence of malaria has been greatly reduced as a result of control measures instituted during the recent war.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of igneous mountains, running parallel to the sea from north-west to south-south-east, the summits of which, in the Picket Hill, Sugar Loaf and Leicester mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of norite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The coastal strip is flat and low-lying and the river estuaries, below high tide mark, are bounded by extensive mangrove swamps. The western and southern part of the Protectorate consists of rolling wooded country, broken in places by ranges of hills rising to 1,000 feet or more. The ground rises to the north and east to form an upland plateau having a general elevation of about 1,500 feet. The Sula and Kangari hills rise to nearly 3,000 feet, while to the east, near the French Guinea frontier, Bintimane peak and the summits of the Tingi range rise to above 6,000 feet. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa the country is well watered by rivers and streams. The principal rivers of Sierra Leone, which empty themselves into the Atlantic Ocean, are the Great and Little Scarcies, the Rokel or Seli (or Sierra Leone River), the Jong or Teye, the Ribbi, the Bum or Sewa, the Moa and the Mano, most of which are navigable by small craft for varying distances.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,900 feet above the sea. It possesses one of the best harbours in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining yield only a small quantity of exportable commodities. Some cassava is grown which is used for local consumption. Fruits and vegetables are also grown in the hilly valleys. The extent of the peninsula area is small (256 square miles), and the generally rocky soil is not well adapted for cultivation.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piasava, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonthe in the South-Western Province as well as through Freetown.

Many districts in the protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, coconuts, beniseed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cocoa, rice and other tropical products.

The mineral industry which owes its inception to the discovery firstly of platinum in 1926 and later of other minerals by the Government Geological Survey, has been responsible for over 50 per cent. in value of the exports of the Colony and Protectorate since 1935. Diamonds are obtained from alluvial workings in the Kono district, chromite is mined in the Kambui hills in the Kenema district and iron ore is extracted at Marampa in the Port Loko district. A large deposit of iron ore has also been proved in the Tonkolili district. The production of gold and platinum which decreased during the 1939-45 war is showing some signs of recovery.

All minerals are vested in the Crown except the deposits at Marampa which belong to the tribal authorities, who have leased them to the operating company.

The main tribes in the Protectorate are in the north, Temne, Limba, Susu, Loko, Fula, Mandingo, Koranko, Yalunka, and in the south Mende, Sherbro, Krim, Gallina, Gola, Vai Kono and Kissi.

HISTORY

The colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor of His Britannic Majesty's brig Miro, on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 31st August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, from various circumstances, had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves, and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on 10th July, 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the colony of Sierra Leone, measuring
10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the treaty of cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 21st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

**CONSTITUTION**

A charter, issued on 27th May, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A further charter, dated 19th February, 1866, established a central government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new charter, dated 24th July, 1874, revoked so much of the charter of 19th February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further charter, dated 17th December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a legislative council in each settlement, consisting of the Officer Administering the Government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New Letters Patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By Letters Patent of 28th November, 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. By Letters Patent, dated 3rd April, 1913, and Royal Instructions, dated 4th May, 1922, there were constituted an Executive Council composed of the Officer in Command of the Troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and a Legislative Council, composed of the members of the Executive Council and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On 7th March, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Conventions, 11th November, 1885, and 21st January, 1911.

The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and provide for giving effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Letters Patent, dated 28th January, 1924, revoked those issued on 3rd April, 1913, and made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instructions issued under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet on the same date cancelled those of 3rd April, 1913, and 4th May, 1922. An Order of the King in Council, dated 16th January, 1924, provided for a new and considerably enlarged Legislative Council, introducing an elective element and direct representation of Protectorate interests into the constitution of that Council for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone.

Proposals for a revised constitution for the Legislative Council were announced in 1947. These provide for a majority of non-official members and for larger representation from the Protectorate. It is hoped that examination of these proposals will be completed and the new constitution introduced during 1948.

**POPULATION**

The estimated population of Sierra Leone at the last census, held in 1931, was as follows:

| Nationality       | Colony | Protectorate | Total, Colony and Protectorate |

**ADMINISTRATION**

**Colony**

That part of Sierra Leone which is administered as Colony consists of the Sierra Leone Peninsula with the adjacent Tasso and Bananas Islands, the town of Bonthe on Sherbro Island, and York Island. It is administered by three authorities:

(a) The Freetown City Council (as constituted under Ordinance No. 38 of 1927). A reformed constitution for the Freetown City Council is provided for by Ordinance No. 1 of 1945, but has not yet been brought into operation.

(b) The Rural Areas Council which deals with the Colony Peninsula, outside the Freetown Municipal Area. It consists of the President, one member elected from each of the four rural areas, and five members nominated by the Governor. A salaried Rural Commissioner, assisted by an advisory committee, is responsible for the administration of each rural area, under the general supervision of the Commissioner of the Headquarters District who is also the President of the Rural Areas Council.

(c) The Sherbro Judicial District, consisting of the town of Bonthe, York Island and the small islands adjacent thereto, is administered in the same way as the Headquarters District of the Colony. The District Commissioner of the Bonthe District (Protectorate) is *ex-officio* President of the Sherbro Judicial District Board, the local authority for the district. The board consists of the President, the Medical Officer, Bonthe, and four unofficial members.

**Protectorate**

The Protectorate is divided into three provinces, Northern, South-Western and South-Eastern, each in charge of a Provincial Commissioner. Administrative control of the whole protectorate is vested in the Chief Commissioner, whose headquarters are at Bo. There are 13 Protectorate Districts each in charge of a District Commissioner. There are 214 Chiefdoms, each ruled by a paramount chief; 113 Chiefdoms, including all the larger ones and about 80 per cent. of the total population of the Protectorate, have been organised as Native Administrations since 1937. These have their own treasuries and are responsible, under the supervision of the District Commissioner, for the local administration and development.

District Councils and a Protectorate Assembly whose functions at present are advisory, have recently been established.

**RELIGION**

Most of the tribes of the Protectorate have come under the influence of Islam, particularly in the north. The Protectorate is, however, predominantly pagan. Christian missions work in all parts of the Protectorate but conversion to Christianity has not been on an extensive scale.

The Colony area is predominantly Christian. Sierra Leone is a diocese of the Church of England, and the Roman Catholic Mission constitutes a vicariate apostolic of the Roman Catholic Church. The most important Christian missions working in Sierra Leone are the Church Missionary Society, Wesleyan Methodist, Roman Catholic, United Brethren in Christ Mission and the American Wesleyan Mission.

**CURRENCY AND BANKING**

Besides English currency, West Africa silver coins (2s., 1s., 6d. and 3d.) were put into circulation in 1913, and alloy coins of similar denominations in 1920. Silver coinage is gradually being withdrawn. The alloy coinage which was put into circulation in 1920 is now also being withdrawn, a new form of alloy "security-edge" coinage having been introduced in January, 1939. The alloy 3d. piece was at the same time replaced by a nickel "security-edge" coin of larger dimensions. Currency notes of the value of 20s. and 10s. were introduced in 1916 and of 2s. in 1917, and 1s. in 1919, but the last two denominations are not now current. The Bank of British West Africa has one branch in the Colony and some agencies in the Protectorate. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), Ltd., also is established in Freetown. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1882.

**COMMUNICATIONS**

Under normal conditions mail steamers leave Liverpool for Freetown and Freetown for Plymouth and Liverpool every fortnight, the passage taking about ten days.

The tonnage of shipping entered and cleared for the period 1937–1946 was as follows:

| Year | British Tonnage | Total Tonnage |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1937 | 3,537,932       | 5,473,014    |
| 1938 | 3,325,842       | 5,459,924    |
| 1939 | 6,931,251       | 8,673,740    |
| 1940 | 9,508,551       | 11,345,781   |
| 1941 | 6,113,793       | 8,162,249    |
| 1942 | 6,919,931       | 8,927,347    |
| 1943 | 6,022,960       | 7,704,328    |
| 1944 | 5,930,264       | 7,899,823    |
| 1945 | 3,926,737       | 5,220,839    |
| 1946 | 1,955,137       | 2,435,354    |

The West African Airways Corporation provides a service which connects with the trunk routes between the United Kingdom and West Africa. This service carries passengers and mail and at present uses the former Royal Air Force airfield at Lungi. There are also emergency landing grounds at Port Loko, Magburaka, Bo and Daru.

Cable and wireless stations at Freetown maintain telegraphic communication with all parts of the world and with ships at sea.

The main line of the Sierra Leone Government railway, which was the first railway to be constructed in British West Africa, runs from the Freetown terminus to Pendembu in the Kailahun district, a distance of 227½ miles. From Bauya Junction, 644 miles from Freetown, a branch line runs to Makeni, a distance of 82½ miles. The number of stations and flag stations is 47. The gauge of the railway is 2 feet 6 inches. The Marampa Railway (3 feet 6 inches gauge) running from the iron ore deposits at Marampa to Pepel, the port of shipment, is 57½ miles long. This railway is owned by the Sierra Leone Development Company, Limited, and is used only for the transport of iron ore.

The total revenue and expenditure of the Government railway for 1946 were £372,496 and £442,924 respectively.

There are about 2,000 miles of combined telegraph and telephone lines in operation.

There are 1,095 miles of first-class roads in the Protectorate constructed and maintained by the
Public Works Department, about 294 miles of Native Administration or chief's roads of a lower standard of construction and about 90 miles of roads constructed and maintained by private companies.

In the Colony Peninsula, there are 160 miles of first-class roads constructed and maintained by the Public Works Department, of which 78 miles are bitumen surfaced.

The Sherbro River is navigable by ocean-going vessels for 45 miles and the Sierra Leone River is navigable as far as Pepel, some 15 miles above Freetown.

The Great Scarcies River, the Little Scarcies River, the Port Loko Creek, the Ribbi River, the Bumpe River, the Kagboro River, the Yukuli River, the Bagru River and the Jong River are all navigable by small craft of 7 feet draught for from 20 to 30 miles from their entrances.

The Kittam River is navigable for launches to Mani (about 90 miles) all the year and for 6 months each year to Pujehun.

There are 77 post offices and postal agencies.

The rates of postage are as follows:

**Surface Mail**

**SOCIAL SERVICES**

**Education**

Facilities for education were provided in the Colony throughout the nineteenth century by religious bodies with financial assistance from the Government. Primary instruction is now provided in amalgamated mission schools, in private schools and in one Government school. In the case of the amalgamated schools, fees are paid into Government revenue and salaries of teachers and cost of equipment are borne by public funds. There is one Government secondary school for boys, and eight assisted secondary schools for boys and girls.

Fourah Bay College (of which the Church Missionary Society are proprietors) is affiliated to Durham University and prepares students for degrees in arts and theology and for teaching diplomas.

In the Protectorate, where education has developed more slowly, there are one Government secondary school for boys, one Government primary boarding school, also for boys, and one Government day school for boys and girls. In the two southern Provinces, there are many mission and chieftain schools, but the Northern Province is not so well served in this respect. There are also three teacher training institutions controlled respectively by Government, Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.

The number of Government and Government-assisted schools at the end of 1946 was as follows:

| Colony. | Schools. | Pupils. |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Primary | 52       | 7,387   |
| Secondary and Post Secondary. | 9 | 2,016 |
| Teacher Training | 1 | 43 |
| Total | 62 | 9,446 |

**Protectorate.**

| Primary | 111 | 12,024 |
| Secondary | 2 | 143 |
| Teacher training | 3 | 152 |
| Total | 116 | 12,319 |

Total, Sierra Leone | 178 | 21,765 |

**Medical and Health Services**

There are Government hospitals in the Protectorate at Bo, Kabala, Port Loko, Pujehun, Moyamba, Makieni and Kailahun. In the Colony area there are the Connaught Hospital (with annexe at Murray Town), the Hill Station Hospital, the Freetown Maternity Hospital and a small general hospital at Bonthe. These hospitals provide accommodation for 495 in-patients (cots for children are not included in this number). Two of the hospitals train nurses, and midwives are trained at the maternity hospital. In addition to 27 Government general dispensaries there are six yaws and sleeping-sickness dispensaries and eight yaws and sleeping-sickness treatment centres maintained by Government. There are also nine native administration dispensaries. Malaria control in Freetown and its environs has been undertaken for some considerable time and the number of malaria-carrying mosquitoes has been reduced to a very low figure. An intensive campaign against sleeping sickness and yaws has been waged since 1939, especially in the eastern part of the Protectorate.

There are five mission hospitals in the Protectorate and one in Freetown, the latter at present being closed owing to shortage of staff. There are two hospitals in the Protectorate belonging to mining companies.

**Labour**

The Labour Department is engaged in the general supervision of conditions of employment of labour, including the establishment of wage-negotiating machinery, conciliation of disputes and inspections. It operates employment exchanges, effects the registration and identification of employees in the Colony, compiles "cost of living" and other statistics, and assists in the development of trade unions. There is also a Trade Training Centre under the control of the Department in which intensive finishing courses and trade tests are provided for artisans.

Import duties, which make provision for preferential treatment to British goods, are mainly specific. A preference equal to half the duty charged on foreign goods is, as a general rule, accorded to the British imports. There are also export duties on palm kernels (20s. per ton), kola nuts (1d. per lb.), ginger (½d. per lb.), sulima piassava (20s. per ton), and Sherbro piassava (40s. per ton). The export duty on palm kernels was raised from 20s. to 30s. per ton in 1947.

Fuller particulars of imports and exports are available in annual reports of the Customs Department.
