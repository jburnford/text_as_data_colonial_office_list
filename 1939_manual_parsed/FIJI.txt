FIJI.

Situation and Area.
The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,700 miles, and from Auckland 1,100 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samos 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotuma consists of all islands, rocks, and reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,053 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,130 square miles, Taveuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Ngau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,056 square miles (nearly equal to Wales).

Physical Features.
The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a maximum height of 4,300 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lowerlands are more lightly timbered, and were probably mostly under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Gold is being mined at Yanawai, near the south coast of Vanua Levu Island, and at Tavua in the northern portion of Vitilovo Island, and prospecting operations are in progress in both localities. At Yanawai the gold is associated with barytes, while at Tavua it occurs in altered andesites. 16,965 ounces of gold bullion and 1,184 ounces of silver were exported from the Colony during 1935. A small percentage of silver is found to be associated with the gold in all bullion exported. Copper ore carrying low gold values occurs in the Sambeto valley in the western portion of Vitilovo, but such deposits have not so far been proved to be pay able.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Singatoka, the Nandi, and Mba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Ndrekoti river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "ndalo" or taro (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotuma.
The Island of Rotuma, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofuia and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotuma chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1936 to number 2,740, of whom two-thirds are Methodists, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra.

The natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity. A European Resident Commissioner is the chief executive authority. He also presides over the Rotuma Court of Justice, styled "The Commissioner's Court." The Commissioner's judicial powers are similar to those of a Commissioner of the Supreme Court of Fiji and a District Commissioner of the Colony, but special provision is made for the hearing of indictable cases in Rotuma. There are also two Native Stipendiary Magistrates.

The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which is a chief appointed by the
Governor, and is administered by the Resident Commissioner with the assistance of a Council of Chiefs, held monthly. The Council, an advisory body, consists of the Resident Commissioner (Chairman), the seven District Chiefs, two Native Stipendiary Magistrates, the Native Medical Practitioner, and one representative from each district.

A Rotuma Regulation Board consisting of the Resident Commissioner, and between five and ten native Rotumans, makes regulations relating to the good government and well-being of the natives. All such regulations are subject to approval by the Legislative Council of Fiji.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1889 at 200,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1876 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. A census was taken on the 26th April, 1936, and the population of the Colony was:

| Europeans | Half Castes | Fijians | Rotumans | Indians | Polynesians | Melanesians | Micronesians | Chinese | Others |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|
|           |             |         |          |        |            |             |             |        |       |
| 4,028     | 4,574       | 97,851  | 2,816    | 85,002 | 737        | 1,616       | 126        | 1,751  | 78    |

Total ... 198,379

The estimated population on the 31st December, 1937, was 206,397.

The births among the native population in 1937 totalled 3,432, and the deaths 2,128. The birth rate was 34·46, and the death rate 21·37 per mil.

The Methodist and Roman Catholic missions gave the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1937:

| Methodist | Roman Catholic |

| 95,551    | 16,309         |

Total ... 111,860

History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1833, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1869 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, in 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in 1874 to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, the Chief of Mbau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Taveuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate Colony, and providing for their government.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and its suburbs is estimated at 1,900.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is oceanic. The south-east trade-wind blows from May to November and during the remaining months the direction of the wind is variable. Between December and April when hot northerly winds blow from the Equator the temperature may occasionally rise as high as 96° and the humidity may reach saturation point. The total average annual rainfall varies in the well defined "wet" and "dry" zones from 60 to 140 inches and the temperature varies from a minimum of 60° to a maximum of 96°.

The highest temperature at Suva in 1937 was 94 degrees on January 16th, and the lowest 63 degrees on August 16th. The total rainfall was 110-70 inches. There is a great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but May to October is usually the driest period. Between November and April, the wet season, hurricanes and cyclonic storms occasionally occur, December to March being the months of greatest frequency.

Constitution.

The constitution is now regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd April, 1937. The Executive Council consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs, the Secretary for Indian Affairs, and two unofficial members nominated by the Governor.

Under the new Letters Patent, the Legislative Council consists of the Governor, 3 ex-officio members (Official), not more than 13 Nominated Official Members, 5 European Members (3 Elected and 2 Nominated), 5 Native Nominated Members and 5 Indian Members (3 Elected and 2 Nominated).

Administration.

A report upon the reorganization of the public services, their administration and the terms and conditions of service was brought into force in 1938.
Native Affairs.

The natives retain a large share of self-government. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by a triennial meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," which has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council.

Shipping.

Suva and Levuka are ports of Registry under the Merchant Shipping Act. On the 31st December, 1937, there were on the Register 2 steam vessels of a tonnage of 2,817 tons, and 11 motor vessels of a tonnage of 8,174 tons.

The number of local vessels trading within the Colony and holding Sea-going Certificates from the Marine Board during 1937 was:

| Owned by | No. | Tons |
|----------|-----|------|
| Europeans | 43  | 1,693|
| Natives   | 14  | 214  |
| Others    | 18  | 314  |

There are two Grammar Schools for Europeans in Suva, one for boys and one for girls, with hostels attached, and a public school in Levuka, all under Government control. The roll number during 1937 at the Boys' Grammar School, Suva, was 161; at the Girls' Grammar School, Suva (where boys under 8 are taken) 236. The roll in 1937 for the Levuka Public School was 127 (boys and girls).

The Queen Victoria Memorial School at Nasinu, near Suva, is intended to provide for the higher education of natives, and is maintained from public revenue. The number of boys on the roll during 1937 was 80.

Schools for the primary education of Fijians may be conducted by the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Seventh Day Adventist Missions, by the Provincial Councils, by any other properly constituted authority or by the Government. Six Provincial Schools have been established by the Government at Lau, Taveuni, Lomaloni, Kandavu, Nandi and Sawani, in charge of European Headmasters.

At the end of 1937 there were 230 Government and assisted schools, 140 for Fijians, Rotumans, etc., and 66 for Indians, 9 receiving both Fijians and Indians, 15 for Europeans and half castes and 1 for Melanesians.

Returns were also received from 116 recognised schools. The total number of pupils in all schools was 24,974—1,480 Europeans, 16,443 Fijians, Rotumans and Melanesians, 6,936 Indians and 115 Chinese.

The estimated expenditure on education for 1938 is £9,044L

Currency and Banking.

Legislation in 1933 and 1934 provided for the issue of Government currency notes and coin which follow the United Kingdom currency denominations.

The Fiji pound is linked to sterling by law at the fixed rate of £F111 = £100 sterling.

The circulation at 31st December, 1937, was:

| Notes | £825,148 |
| Coin  | £81,760  |

£706,908

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka and Lautoka, and four agencies; the Bank of New Zealand has a branch at Suva.

Under Ordinance I, of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened in 1908. At the end of 1937 there were 11,358 depositors and 360,601L in deposits.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

The trade and commerce of the Colony up to 1935 depended for its existence on three staple industries, viz. (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas. Considerable progress has been made in gold mining and in 1936, gold displaced bananas as the third principal export.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 34 tons were exported. The cotton industry is again receiving attention. As a result of the Ottawa Conference, Australia now admits 40,000 centsals of bananas per year, with a preferential duty of 2s. 6d. per cental. High costs in Australia still provide a
barrier to trade and the shipments are negligible. Previously, owing to the imposition by the Commonwealth Government, in 1921, of a prohibitive duty on imported bananas, the export of this fruit was entirely confined to the New Zealand Market. A number of trial shipments of bananas to Canada were made in 1934, and this market, in 1937, took 21,996 bunches valued at £5,432.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas, pineapples, and citrus fruits. Exports of the produce of the Colony increased in value from £2,023,486 in 1936 to £2,121,920 in 1937. The principal exports were sugar, copra, gold, and bananas. The quantities and value exported in 1937 were as follows:—Sugar, 129,692 tons, value £1,388,881.; Copra, 30,001 tons, value £407,364.; Gold, 21,407 oz., value £166,115.; Bananas, 326,777 bunches, value £80,071.

The other principal exports in 1937 consisted of:—Molasses 19,873 tons, value £19,673.; Trochas Shell 144 tons, value £12,723.; Biscuits, plain, 180,332 lbs., value £8,844.; Cotton 24,589 lbs., value £1,161.; Fruit, fresh (other than bananas), value £5,191.; Gum 7,594 cwt., value £9,582.; Hides 5,429 hides, value £4,220.; Oil, coconut, 147 tons, value £4,337.; Vegetables, fresh, 15,807 cwt., £7,309.; Soap, plain, 4,370 cwt., value £6,002.

The rice crop is insufficient for local demands and the importation of this commodity was 3,268 tons in 1936 and 2,980 tons in 1937.

Dairying is an established industry and only 10 lbs. of fresh butter were imported in 1937.

There are established in Suva a Soap Factory and a Biscuit Factory which supply a considerable proportion of the local requirements and as will be seen from the export figures above, enjoy an increasing trade with other groups in the Pacific.

Many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted for cattle and sheep raising.

The Customs Tariff is, in general, on an ad valorem basis, duty being assessed on the value of goods at the port of shipment. Practically all products of the British Empire receive preferential treatment, provided that British Empire material and labour represent not less than 25 per cent. of the value of the goods, and that the final processes of manufacture are performed within the British Empire. A few special items require 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. Empire content.

The total trade of the Colony in 1937 was £3,974,401.

The total trade was divided as follows:—

| Imports % | Exports % |
|-----------|-----------|
| United Kingdom | 34·24 | 38·90 |
| Other British Possessions | 48·17 | 45·99 |
| Foreign Countries | 15·57 | 14·78 |
| Parcels Post | 2·02 | — |
| Ships Stores | — | 33 |

The following figures show the trade of the Colony during the last five years:—

| Year | Imports | Exports | Total Trade |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1933 | 1,069,266 | 1,725,529 | 2,794,795 |

Means of Communication.

There is a direct six-weekly cargo service from the United Kingdom.

There is regular steam communication with Australia and New Zealand, a monthly service with Canada, and a monthly service with U.S.A. Inter-island communication is maintained by regular steamer or cutter services.

Postage rates on letters addressed to countries beyond Fiji:—

(a) To Great Britain and Ireland, India and other countries within the British Empire which are served by air under the Empire Air Mail Scheme or partly by air and partly by surface transport: 2d. per half ounce.

(b) To Australia, New Zealand and other British Colonies: First ounce, 2d.; each succeeding ounce 1d.

(c) To other countries in the Postal Union: First ounce, 3d.; each succeeding ounce 1½d.

Internal postal rates: Letters, first ounce 2d.; each succeeding ounce 1d. Printed papers, for every 4 ozs. ½d.

All letters for Great Britain, India and other Empire countries served by the Australia-England and the England-South Africa air routes are despatched by sea to Australia to be sent forward by air as far as the service permits. Similarly, Great Britain and these Empire countries forward all letters for Fiji by air to Australia. The normal transit time of letter mails from Fiji to Great Britain is approximately eighteen days.

A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. There is also a Parcels Post with the Australian States, New Zealand, Tonga, India, Canada and the United States of America. The rates of postage are as follows:—

Great Britain and Northern Ireland:—

(a) Via Canada: 3 lbs. 3s. 3d.; 7 lbs. 5s. 10d.; 11 lbs. 8s. 6d.

(b) Via New Zealand: 3 lbs. 2s. 9d.; 7 lbs. 4s. 5d.; 11 lbs. 8s. 6d.

Australia and Tonga: 1 lb. 8d.; every additional lb. up to 11 lbs. 6d.

New Zealand: 3 lbs. 2s.; 7 lbs. 3s. 4d.; 11 lbs. 4s. 9d.

India: 3 lbs. 2s. 5d.; 7 lbs. 4s. 7d.; 11 lbs. 7s. ld.

Canada and the United States of America: 1 lb. 8d.; every additional lb. up to 11 lbs. 6d.

The Colony entered the Postal Union in 1891. The Imperial Postal Order system has been adopted by this Colony.

A wireless telegraphy service is operated in the Colony. There are stations at Suva and Lautoka in the island of Viti Levu, at Lambasa and Savusavu in the island of Vanua Levu and at Waiyevo (Taveuni), Levuka ( Ovalau ) and Rotuma. Telephone Exchanges have been established at Suva, Nasori, Lautoka, Ba, Nandi, Tavua, Vatukoula, Navua,
Lavuka, Savu Savu and Taveuni. Suva is connected by telephone line to Nausori, Vunidawa, Tailevu, Navua and Nandroga. Suva is directly connected by submarine cable with New Zealand, Australia and Canada. An external wireless service linking the Colony directly with Australasia is operated by the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited.

There is no railway in the Colony. The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. owns various tramlines connecting with estates, and these tramlines are in certain cases open to public use. An all-weather motor road, connecting Suva with Tailevu, Tavua, Mba, Lautoka, Nandi and Sigatoka, has been in use for some years, and the final link between Sigatoka and Suva, a distance of approximately 85 miles, was completed in June, 1938. The total distance by road round the island of Viti Levu is 322 miles, the distance to Lautoka via Ra, Tavua and Mba being 168 miles, and the distance via Navua and Sigatoka being 154 miles.
