CAYMAN ISLANDS.

Description.

The Cayman Islands, which form a dependency of Jamaica, consist of three islands—Grand Cayman, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac—lying between 79° 83' and 81° 30' W. longitude and 19° 16' and 19° 45' N. latitude, and having a total area of about 104 square miles. They were discovered by Columbus on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession soon after the conquest of Jamaica in the middle of the seventeenth century and the islands were mainly colonised from Jamaica, though many English and Scottish mariners, shipwrecked on the coast of Cuba, settled on the islands.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is considerably larger than in other parts of the West Indies.

The principal island, Grand Cayman, is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, with a varying breadth from 4 to 7 miles, and has an area of 85 square miles. The total population of the islands is 6,009, of which some 4,592 live in Grand Cayman, where Georgetown, the capital town, with a population of 1,321, is situated.

The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized deep-water harbours.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

The chief industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle—or "turtling," as it is called. These turtles are brought to the island and placed in "crawls" to recover and fatten before export. The total number of turtle exported in 1937 amounted to 2,921, valued at £2,865l. The export of shark skins in 1937, 6,254 skins, was valued at £1,373l.

The people are first-class shipbuilders and many fine schooners are built in these islands for local use and sale abroad.

Georgetown is a Port of Registry and 42 sailing vessels and 9 motor vessels, with an aggregate net tonnage of 3,630, are on the registry of shipping there.

The islands are in some parts fruitful and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable acreage is traversed by honeycombed limestone and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found. Agricultural pursuits are fostered and encouraged by an Agricultural Society.

Many of the islanders find employment on the mainland of America and in foreign vessels, supporting their families in Cayman by remittances from abroad.

An ad valorem customs duty of 12½% is levied on most imported commodities, with specific duties on alcoholic liquors and tobacco. The revenue derived from these duties amounted to £3,852l. in 1937.

There is a British preferential tariff on certain articles.

Climate.

The climate from November to March is cool, the prevailing winds being from the north, but during the summer months, it is hot, with southerly winds. Mosquitoes abound in the summer. The rainfall at Georgetown during 1937 was 80.27 inches, the average annual rainfall being about 55 inches.

The more recent hurricanes at the islands occurred in November, 1932, September, 1917, August, 1909, and August, 1903—previous to this there was a severe hurricane in October, 1876. During 1935 a modern Meteorological Station was erected at Georgetown, and observations taken form an important study of Meteorological phenomena in the Caribbean, especially in connection with hurricanes.

Communications.

A regular motor-schooner service is maintained from Georgetown with Kingston, Jamaica. There is also communication by sailing and motor vessels with the ports of Central America and the United States.

There are motorable roads connecting every district in both Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac.

There are two wireless stations: Georgetown, Grand Cayman and Stake Bay, Cayman Brac; the latter established in 1936, the former in 1935. The principal tariffs per word are (deferred):—Jamaica, 6d.; United Kingdom, 1s. 5d.; Canada, 1s. 2d.; New York, 1s.

Education.

Education is in charge of a Board of Education which receives an annual grant of £1,500l. from the public revenue. Thirteen public elementary schools are maintained, with a roll of 886 pupils and an average attendance of 670.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Commissioner who is also Judge of the Grand Court. Justices of the Peace (at present 24) are appointed by the Governor of Jamaica and these, with 27 elected members, known as Vestrymen, constitute the Legislative Assembly under the presidency of the Commissioner. Elections are held biennially.
The present constitution of this Assembly of Justices and Vestry is 100 years old and the centenary was commemorated by a special issue of postage stamps in 1932.

The Public Debt amounts to 3,660l. being a loan made by the Government of Jamaica in 1933 to the Dependency to assist it in repairing the damage caused by the hurricane of 1932.
