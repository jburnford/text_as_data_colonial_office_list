TONGA.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, with an area of about 250 square miles, are situated between the 18th and 22nd degrees of south latitude. They were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most of the islands are of coral formation, but some are volcanic, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafoou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand and Samoa. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. There is monthly communication by steamer with Auckland. During the dry season, i.e., from April to December, steamers call at regular intervals for copra freights.

In 1845 George Tubou I, who was the first to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, was proclaimed King. The present Ruler is assisted by a Parliament and a Privy Council. The Privy Council is composed of two European and six Native Ministers of the Crown who are also heads of the various government departments. The civil service is composed mostly of Tongans, the European officials numbering about 24. The general tariff is 33½% ad valorem and British preferential 12½%, ad valorem.

| 1934 | 14        |
| 1935 | 31        |
| 1936 | 23·74     |

Of the rest of the imports during 1937 the United Kingdom supplied 15·51 per cent., New Zealand 22 per cent., Australia 26·77 per cent. and other British possessions 9·75 per cent.

The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are seven churches in Tonga, viz., the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, with about 18,053 adherents; the Free Church of Tonga, and the Church of Tonga, with about 9,029; the Roman Catholic Mission, with about 4,230; the Church of England, 479; the Church of Latter Day Saints, 641; and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, with about 256 adherents.

The Wesleyan Mission was first founded in Tonga in the year 1826, and a few years later the chiefs and people embraced Christianity and became members of the Church. The control and management of the Mission in Tonga were entrusted about the year 1857 to the Australasian Conference and continued until the year 1885, when King George Tubou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded, with a large majority of his chiefs and people and, with the assistance of the Rev. Shirley Baker, established the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga as a separate and independent body though retaining the same doctrines, discipline, and form of worship as the Wesleyan Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakagoo," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-use could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylatart Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakagoo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.
In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

In the year 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church, and an enquiry that was held into the state of the finances disclosed a very lax state of affairs. As a result of this enquiry it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies as a separate and independent Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. At a joint conference of the two churches held in April, 1924, union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. A. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued as a result of this division in respect of the ownership of the churches and property of the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga established by King George I in 1885. It was finally decided on appeal in favour of the united Church, of which the present Queen is the head.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufasahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917 to Prince Uliami Tugi, the present Premier, and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed on 18th May, 1900.

The present premier, Uliami Tugi, is the Prince Consort, and was formerly Minister for Lands. The progress of Tonga since 1905 has been satisfactory.

Every Tongan is entitled to an allotment of land for cultivation, so that no unemployment exists. Primary education for Tongans between the ages of 6 and 14 is compulsory. There are two boys' colleges at which provision is made for secondary education. Secondary education of girls is entirely in the hands of the Christian missions. Medical work is well organised; and, unlike most native communities in the Pacific, the native population steadily increases in number.

British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment exceeding two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga Courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner. Licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British and Australian sterling.

Arrangements were made in 1919 for the issue of Tongan Government Treasury notes. At the end of 1937, 4s., 10s., 1l., and 5l. notes were in circulation to the value of 25,073l. The issue is secured by an investment reserve. The Treasury Notes Act, 1935, adopts the exchange standard system based on Australian currency.

There are no private banks in the Kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1937 there were 1,634 depositors and 30,242l. in deposits.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 sq. miles. The non-native population is about 2,000 and the native is estimated at 40,000.

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, Seventh Day Adventists and Church of Christ, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia and by the Roman Catholic Church.
discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. Bounty, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence.

UNIV. MICH.
The distance from New England was 1 mile.
The principal exports are copra, cocoa, coffee, tobacco; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 15th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers, have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium Staff working in Departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners.

The Customs Tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

Of the import trade of the group about 68 per cent. is claimed by Australia, 18 per cent. by France, and the remainder by Britain, Japan, China and U.S.A., while the bulk of the exports are shipped to France.

**PITCAIRN ISLAND.**

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (26° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' W. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. Bounty, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population (at 30th June, 1936) numbers 202 persons.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, R. E. Christian.

The Government is now administered under the High Commissioner, by a Council consisting of a Chief Magistrate, two Assessors, a Secretary and a Chairman of the Internal Committee. These officers are elected annually by the people.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
