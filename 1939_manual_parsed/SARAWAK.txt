SARAWAK.

General.

In 1864 Great Britain recognized Sarawak as an independent State. An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 442,900 composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 450 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kedurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kedurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1884 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1905. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

UGANDA.

(For Map see under Kenya.)

Extent and Boundaries.
The British Protectorate over Buganda was proclaimed on August 27th, 1894. The Protectorate was further extended over Bunyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Buganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth as follows:

On the east by Kenya Colony as far north as Mount Zulie, near the 4th degree of north latitude, the natural boundaries being the Turkana escarpment, Mount Elgon, and the Sio River running into the north-east corner of Lake Victoria; on the south, by the Tanganyika Territory and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the frontier of the Belgian Congo, the natural boundaries being Lake Edward, Mt. Ruwenzori, the Semiliki River, Lake Albert and the Nile watershed; and on the north, by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

The area of the Uganda Protectorate is estimated at 93,981 square miles, including 13,680 square miles of water. Pending the complete survey of the country, it is not possible to give the correct area.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate is divided into three provinces (Eastern, Western, and Buganda), and then again into numerous districts.

The headquarters of the Uganda administration are at Entebbe, and the chief commercial towns in the Protectorate are Kampala and Jinja; all three are on or near the North shore of Lake Victoria.

Climate.
The climate, when compared with that of some tropical countries, is not unpleasant, but there are parts of the country which can by no means be called healthy. The conditions vary with the altitude in different parts of the Protectorate: the Nile Valley, which lies about 2,000 feet above sea-level, is hot, and is considerably more unhealthy than the higher-lying regions between Lakes Victoria and Albert. The most congenial climate for European residence is found in the Buganda kingdom and in the Western Province, where in some districts the altitude exceeds 5,000 feet above sea-level. European children thrive well in infancy in a few of the healthier stations, but considerable risk is attached to bringing them out when over six or seven years old, as they are always liable to attacks of malaria and the anaemia and general ill-health resulting therefrom.

The climate is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the year 1937 at Entebbe being—Mean maximum, 77° Fahrenheit; mean minimum, 63·3° Fahrenheit. Average daily sunshine 6·3 hours.

The lowest rainfall for 1937 was recorded at Mwiransandu (Western Province), which registered 29·33 inches, the highest (128·75) being recorded at Kalangala (Sesse Islands).

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February.

The healthiest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the least healthy, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to those immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes become more in evidence and malaria infections more numerous.
No part of the Protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Kigezi in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria prevails at all seasons of the year.

Sleeping sickness, which proved such a scourge to the country in 1902 and the years following and necessitated the evacuation of the natives from the islands in Lake Victoria, and from the shores of the great lakes and rivers, is now well under control. During 1921 and 1922 the island population was to a great extent restored and many of the islands were successfully reopened. The focus of the disease is no longer on Lake Victoria.

Plague and smallpox are unfortunately endemic in the native population, but it has been possible to confine outbreaks for the most part within narrow limits. Active measures against these diseases are constantly engaging the attention of the medical and administrative authorities.

History.

The countries that now make up the Uganda Protectorate did not become known to Europe until the journey of Speke and Grant in search of the sources of the Nile, which brought them to Buganda in 1862 and to Bunyoro a year later. In both countries they found a somewhat advanced indigenous civilisation, and it is around the rivalries of these two principalities that all the early history of the country centres. The Swahili form of "Buganda," the country of the Baganda people, has been adopted as the name of the whole Protectorate, although there are many other quite separate races and tribes among its inhabitants. Speke's discoveries were not at first credited, but were soon confirmed by Sir Samuel Baker and his wife who discovered Lake Albert. The first missionaries arrived in Buganda in 1877, and the rivalries of Protestant, Catholic and Mohammediain which soon naturally arose ended, after the death of the old king, Mutesa, and the accession of his weak and vacillating son, Mwanga, to the throne in 1884, in bloodshed. The Imperial British East Africa Company which, after concluding a treaty with Mwanga in 1890, had occupied Kampala with a weak force under Capt. Lugard, had much difficulty in trying to compose these rivalries, and would have been forced to abandon the country but for the intervention of the British Government, which sent out a Special Commissioner, Sir Gerald Portal, in 1893. His enquiry and negotiations led to the establishment of the Protectorate in the following year. For three years the country remained quiet, but in 1897 mutiny broke out among some of the Sudanese troops who had been recruited by the Company from the remains of the Egyptian forces cut off by the Mahdist rebellion. It soon spread to all the discontented elements, but was ultimately overcome after having seriously menaced British rule. Finally the two kings—Mwanga of Buganda and Kabarega of Bunyoro—who had always resented European penetration and had seized upon the mutiny as a good opportunity to put an end to it, were captured and deported.

Since then there is little but peaceful progress to record. Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government in 1900 as Special Commissioner to settle the country, and concluded agreements with the heads of the native principalities of Buganda, Toro and Ankole, which laid down the principles governing their administrative relations with the Crown and the ownership of the land. No such arrangements could be made at the time with regard to the rest of the present Protectorate, but administration has since been extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganised tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" have been followed wherever and whenever it was possible as in the "agreement districts." In 1903 the Eastern highlands of the Protectorate along with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony, and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of frontiers with the Sudan, the Belgian Congo, and German East Africa, now the Tanganyika Territory. In 1903 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign to the Colonial Office. In the Great War the population, of all races, remained devotedly loyal and played a great part in the East African campaign. Since then progress, both material and cultural, has continued, the former made possible by the success of the cotton industry and the development of communications, the latter based on the activities of the missions, both Protestant and Catholic, in whose hands was all educational work until 1925.

Constitution.

By the Uganda Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council both consisting of such persons as may be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated the 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, Director of Education, and the Resident Commissioner, Buganda (ex-officio members), and such other persons holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such other persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President.

It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture and Director of Education (ex-officio members), with official and unofficial members as in the case of the Executive Council. There are at present four unofficial members and no official member.

For the East African Governors Conference, see under Kenya.

The Native Government of Buganda has certain rights of internal legislation granted by agreement. The king, or Kabaka, who is accorded the title of "His Highness," rules the Baganda people with the advice of the Governor and of a native Council known as the Lukiko, which also has judicial functions.

Communications.

The Uganda Protectorate is separated by about 500 miles from the nearest point on the east coast of Africa. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the Colony of Kenya, transport was exceedingly difficult before the construction of the "Uganda Railway" from Mombasa to the northeast corner of Lake Victoria, which the Imperial Government decided in 1895 to undertake. This railway at the end of 1901 had covered the whole 554 miles separating Mombasa from Kisumu on Victoria Nyanza, which was the terminus of the railway until recent years.
There is a Lake Steamer Service connecting Entebbe, Port Bell (Kampala), and Jinja with Kisumu and the other ports on Lake Victoria. Steamers ply also on Lake Kioga and on Lake Albert and the Albert Nile as far North as Nimule. All these services are maintained by the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours Administration.

A railway, 63 miles long, from Jinja to Namasagali on the Victoria Nile, giving access to the waterways of Lake Kioga, was completed in 1912, and one from Port Bell on Lake Victoria to Kampala, the principal commercial centre, a distance of 72 miles, was opened for public traffic in 1915.

Since the Great War considerable railway development has taken place, and the main line of the Kenya and Uganda Railway, leaving the original line at Nakuru, now extends into the Eastern Province of Uganda to join the Jinja-Namasagali railway at Mbulamuti, and so places Uganda in direct communication with the Coast. An extension of this line from Tororo, near the Kenya border, to Mbale and Soroti was completed in 1929, and the linking up of Jinja with Kampala—a scheme which involved the bridging of the Victoria Nile at the former place—was completed in the early part of 1931.

The system of all-weather main roads radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres is maintained by the Public Works Department, which has a road mileage of 2,075 under its control. A system of roads in the Western Province establishes connection between the tin-mines and the Kagera River steamship service, taps the resources of the Ruchuru area of the Belgian Congo for that service, and links up direct the district headquarters in the west of the Protectorate. About 6,324 miles of excellent roads are also kept up by the Native Administrations. Motor-transport, in consequence of these facilities, has reached an advanced stage of development in the Protectorate.

The Uganda Posts and Telegraphs Department is amalgamated with those of Kenya and Tanganyika under the control of the Postmaster-General at Nairobi.

Uganda is now in telegraphic communication with Mombasa and Dar-es-Salam by land lines, and thence by cable with Great Britain and other countries and also by wireless to Great Britain through Nairobi. All important centres within the Protectorate are also connected by telegraph.

The total mileage of telegraph and telephone pole route at the end of 1937 was 1,574, and the wire mileage 5,156. Telephone exchanges are worked at Entebbe, Kampala, Jinja, Iganga, Busambatia, Mbale, Tororo, Bombo, Mpigi, Busia and Masaka, and connected by trunk lines.

Aviation.

Landing grounds are kept up at Kololo (Kampala), Entebbe, Tororo, Masindi, Gulu, Mbarara and Jinja, Lira, Butiaba, Arua and Moroto. Landing facilities for seaplanes exist at Entebbe, Port Bell, Jinja and Butiaba. There is no accommodation in Uganda for housing aircraft, but repairs can be carried out at the above places. Tri-weekly communication by air with Europe and South Africa, has now been established by means of Imperial Airways, Ltd.

Industries.

Coffee of the Arabica and Robusta varieties has been introduced and thrives exceedingly well; the former is the principal crop on European plantations, and both are being grown in increasing quantities by Africans. The principal industry is cotton, and 1,333,666 centsals of lint, valued at £4,269,283, as well as 103,440 tons of cotton seed, of a value of £92,083, were exported in 1937. Sugar, hides and skins, ground-nuts and chillies, are the other principal agricultural exports, and, except for sugar, practically all the production is in native hands. Mineral discoveries have been made in recent years, and there is a considerable export of high-grade tin ore from the Western Province. 19,590 ozs. (troy) of gold, valued at £24,713l., was also exported in 1937. Cattle are plentiful. Leasehold grants of land can be obtained from the government, but the issue of freehold concessions has been withdrawn for the present.

The weights and measures in common use in the Protectorate are the Imperial weights and measures. The currency is the same as that of Kenya.

Banking facilities are afforded by the National Bank of India Ltd., with branches at Entebbe, Kampala, and Jinja, the Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., with branches at Kampala and Jinja, by Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Kampala and Jinja, and the Marohant's Bank at Kampala.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1917 Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

A uniform Tariff was adopted in 1923 for Kenya and Uganda, operating also in Tanganyika Territory. Under this tariff all export duties were abolished and the import schedules were remodelled to provide for the imposition of "specific" duties and of "ad valorem" duties varying from 10% to 62½% of the landed value of goods liable to duty on importation. In addition, free trade between Kenya, Uganda and the Tanganyika Territory in goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of each of the territories was established. The 1923 Tariff with minor alterations, remained in force until April, 1930, advantage of the existence of a tariff common to the three territories being taken to institute in August, 1927, a system of extending unrestricted trading to imported goods passing between the territories. Under this procedure, which is operated by means of transfer forms, single payment of duty only is chargeable, the Customs Revenue involved being credited to the consuming territory by inter-departmental entry.

In 1930 a uniform modernised Tariff scheduled according to commodities as opposed to rates was negotiated and enacted in the three territories simultaneously. Included in the provisions of the Tariff Ordinance is an amended definition of value for purposes of assessment of duty which brings the East Africa Tariff Laws into conformity with the practice followed in many other countries and allows of the acceptance of certificates of value endorsed on invoices in the stereotyped form approved by the Imperial Customs Conference, 1921.

The basis of assessment is now the current domestic value in the country of export plus freight and other charges incurred up to the time of importation of goods into Kenya, Uganda or the Tanganyika Territory as the case may be. As regards certain specially protected commodities (wheat, flour, sugar, timber, etc.), the device of "suspended duties" has been adopted in order to allow of a defined margin of elasticity in each territory in the matter of imposition on specified articles of "suspended duties" as distinct from basic duties, without interference with the main principle of a common Tariff. The 1930 Tariff Ordinances of the three territories produce that the Governor, with the approval of Legislative Council, may impose by Proclamation either in part or in full a duty referred to in the Tariff schedules as a "suspended duty," the effect being that each Government has the right to vary "suspended duties" up to the amount specified in the Tariff. At the same time an undertaking has been given by each Government that removals of any of the
"Suspended duties" will only take place after prior consultation with the other Governments concerned.

In 1931 the Consumption Tax previously leviable on wines and spirits cleared for consumption in Kenya was incorporated in the common Tariff and certain increases in the rates of duty chargeable on vehicles and parts (including tyres and tubes) were imposed in the three territories.

The import tariff as it now stands admits free of duty goods essential to the agricultural, industrial, educational and scientific development of the territories and has been designed, as far as possible, to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika Territory, taken as an economic unit, are, or can be made, self-supporting.

The net amount of Customs receipts credited to Uganda from all sources was £67,075.4 in 1937.

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.

The Colony, which includes Ocean, Christmas, Fanning, and Washington Islands, besides the Gilbert, Ellice and Phoenix Groups, is under the charge of a Resident Commissioner, who is responsible to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific who resides in Fiji.

The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:—Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang (Northern Gilberts); Tarawa, Maiana, Abemama, Karua, Aranuka (Central Gilberts), Nonouti, Tabiteuea, Beru, Nikunau, Onotoa, Tamana, Aroeme (Southern Gilberts).

The Ellice Islands are the following nine:—Nanumae, Nanumaga, Niutao, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Naurakita.

The Phoenix Islands were annexed to the Colony in March, 1937. They consist of Birnie, Canton, Enderbury, Gardner, Hull, McKean, Phoenix and Sydney Islands.

The three groups above form a rough triangle, the approximate geographical positions of whose vertices are:—North (Gilbert Is.) 30°N., 173°E.; East (Phoenix Is.) 4°S., 171°W.; South (Ellice Is.) 11°S., 179°E.

The population of the Colony as determined at the 1931 Census was:—Ocean Island, 2,309; Gilbert Islands, 26,528; Ellice Islands, 4,074; Fanning, Washington and Christmas Islands, 605. The total of 33,416 comprised 275 Europeans, 32,467 natives, 236 half-castes and 439 Asiatics. An annual count is made of the population, but the figures obtained are not sufficiently accurate to be of value for comparative purposes.

With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate.

A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.

OCEAN ISLAND (or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long 169° 36' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. Reaching a height of 280 ft. and covered with vegetation, it is the only island of the Colony not of stoll formation. The population of Ocean Island on the 31st December, 1937, was 2,878. This total included 134 Europeans, 793 Chinese, 852 Banabans, and 1,951 Gilbert and Ellice Islanders (the majority of the latter being employed in the phosphate industry).

FANNING AND WASHINGTON ISLANDS lie about 30° 51' N. latitude, and 169° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. An Acting Administrative Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 23. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the Colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel chartered by Fanning Island Plantations Ltd. The population of Fanning Island at the 31st December, 1937, was 193, that at Washington Island at the same time being 122.

CHRISTMAS ISLAND (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell, and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. All vessels employed or chartered by the Company trading between the Society Islands and Christmas Island have been exempted from the Quarantine Ordinance, and may visit Christmas Island without a preliminary call at a prescribed port of entry in the Colony. Periodical visits are made by H.M.'s ships. The population on the 31st December, 1937, numbered 6.
PHOENIX GROUP.

The Phoenix group comprises Phoenix, Birnie, Hull, Canton, Gardner, McKean, Enderbury and Sydney Islands, and is situated to the east of the Gilbert and Ellice groups. The Islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to Messrs. Burns, Philp (South Sea) Company, Limited, for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914. By an Order in Council dated 16th March, 1937, the boundaries of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony were extended to include the Phoenix Group.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work is undertaken and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. All the inhabited islands have native hospitals under the charge of native students trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Communication between the various islands was formerly infrequent, depending on the irregular movements of vessels belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, Limited, on Chong and Company Limited, and the British Phosphate Commissioners, but the acquisition by the Administration of the auxiliary sailing vessel "Nimanoa" has considerably increased the facilities for regular communication.

The principal sources of revenue are import duties (general ad valorem rate 25 per cent., British preferential ad valorem rate 12½ per cent.); export duty on copra; land tax (paid in copra) on native communities; capitation tax 10L a head p.a. on non-natives; ship, trading and other licences; royalty on phosphate shipped from Ocean Island; interest on invested funds and consolidated payment by the British Phosphate Commissioners. By virtue of the latter the Commissioners are exempted from certain taxation and duties.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.

British Solomon Islands Protectorate is situated between the parallels of 5° South and 12° 30' and the meridians of 165° and 170° of East longitude.

Protectorate consists of a double row of volcanic islands, extending at its extremities from Bougainville Straits to Mitre Island, in the Santa Cruz Group, for a distance of 900 miles, and south from the Ontong Java Group to all Island for a distance of 430 miles, in an area approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,000 square miles are land.

The native population (mainly Melanesian) is 50,000.

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in the year 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. The island first sighted they named Ysabel because it was on that Saint's day they left Callao. In the year 1569 a second expedition under Mendana sailed from Peru, but failed to locate the island of Guadalcanal, whereon as intended he should form a settlement, and he went in the Santa Cruz Group, and landed at Choiseul Bay. The new colony proved a failure, the death of Mendana put an end to any prospect of success, and the remnants of the original party returned to Peru.

In 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz Group and the north-west coast line of the island Malaita.

In the same year de Bougainville in the frigate Boudicca, sailed from Monte Video on a deliberate search of the Terra Australis which he missed, and arrived at New Guinea; in sailing back he passed through the Straits which are the present northern boundary of the Protectorate, the island on his right being named Bougainville after him, and the one on the left named after Choiseul, who was at the time Minister of France.

Twenty years later, and 700 miles to the south-east, la Perouse, in command of the French frigates L'Astrolabe and La Boussole, on a voyage of discovery, was wrecked at Piton on the island of Vanikoro. His fate was unknown for 40 years.

From this time, many Europeans visited the Group, and British ships-of-war paid periodical visits.

In 1860 natives were recruited to work on plantations in Queensland and Fiji. The recruiting for Queensland ceased in 1903 and most of the natives were repatriated.

Recruiting for Fiji continued until 1910.

Between the years 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the Proclamation in 1893 of the British Protectorate over the Southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristoval, the New Georgia Group and its Dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50.

In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz Group, including Utupua, Tuocopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona, were added to the Protectorate, and in 1900 the Northern Islands, namely, Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits, south and south-east of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ontong Java, were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

The population of the Protectorate in 1937 was:

| Europeans | Native (Melanesian) | Native (Polynesian) | Chinese | Japanese | Malays |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|----------|-------|
|           |                     |                     |        |          |       |
| 478       | 89,568              | 3,847               | 192    | 8        | 1     |
| Total     |                     |                     |        |          |       |

The climate of the Solomon Islands, owing to the prevalence of malaria, is not healthy, but the conditions of living have been greatly improved during recent years and the possibilities of good health during temporary residence have been enormously increased.

Generally speaking, the seasons are well defined by the trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the lowest minimum temperature is recorded, and the highest mean and maximum temperatures are, as a rule, recorded in the months from November to April which is commonly known as the north-west season.

The rainfall varies considerably from month to month and year to year, though the average rainfall, recorded at Tulagi, is approximately 120 inches a year.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed in Tulagi) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific (who resides in Suva, Fiji).

There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of King's Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

There is an Advisory Council, consisting of the Resident Commissioner and not more than seven members, three of whom may be officials.

The Protectorate is divided up into eight administrative areas, each under a District Officer. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The Customs Tariff consists of duties at specific or ad valorem rates on certain imports and exports and includes provisions for Empire preferences.
Percentage of Trade with the United Kingdom ... 13·9%
Percentage of Trade with other parts of the British Empire ... 67·4%
Percentage of Foreign Trade ... 18·7%

TONGA.

The Tongoan, or Friendly Islands, with an area of about 260 square miles, are situated between the 18th and 22nd degrees of south latitude. They were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most of the islands are of coral formation, but some are volcanic, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand and Samoa. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. There is monthly communication by steamer with Auckland. During the dry season, i.e., from April to December, steamers call at regular intervals for copra freights.

Census of Population, April, 1937:

| Category          | Number |
|-------------------|--------|
| Europeans         | 443    |
| Half-castes       | 306    |

| Tongans           | 31,753 |
| Total             | 32,861 |

In 1845 George Tubou I, who was the first to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, was proclaimed King. The present Ruler is assisted by a Parliament and a Privy Council. The Privy Council is composed of two Europeans and six Native Ministers of the Crown who are also heads of the various government departments. The civil service is composed mostly of Tongans, the European officials numbering about 24. The general tariff is 33½% ad valorem and British preferential 12½% ad valorem.

| Year | Imports | Exports |

| 1936 | 92,296  | 116,639 |
| 1937 | 137,365 | 164,621 |

The imports, apart from oils and drapery, are of Empire origin. The following figures show the percentage of imports from foreign countries:

| Year | Per Cent. |
|------|-----------|
| 1933 | 23·37     |
| 1934 | 14        |
| 1935 | 31        |
| 1936 | 23·74     |
| 1937 | 25·97     |

Of the rest of the imports during 1937 the United Kingdom supplied 15·61 per cent., New Zealand 22 per cent., Australia 26·77 per cent. and other British possessions 9·75 per cent.

The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are seven churches in Tonga, viz., the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, with about 18,063 adherents; the Free Church of Tonga, and the Church of Tonga, with about 9,029; the Roman Catholic Mission, with about 4,230; the Church of England, 479; the Church of Latter Day Saints, 641; and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, with about 256 adherents.

The Wesleyan Mission was first founded in Tonga in the year 1826, and a few years later the chiefs and people embraced Christianity and became members of the Church. The control and management of the Mission in Tonga were entrusted about the year 1857 to the Australasian Conference and continued until the year 1885, when King George Tubou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded, with a large majority of his chiefs and people and, with the assistance of the Rev. Shirley Baker, established the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga as a separate and independent body though retaining the same doctrines, discipline, and form of worship as the Wesleyan Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-usage could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pystalai Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaojo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.
In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuaho). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

In the year 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church, and an enquiry that was held into the state of the finances disclosed a very lax state of affairs. As a result of this enquiry it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies as a separate and independent Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. At a joint conference of the two churches held in April, 1924, union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. A. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued as a result of this division in respect of the ownership of the churches and property of the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga established by King George I in 1885. It was finally decided on appeal in favour of the united Church, of which the present Queen is the head.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufaahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917 to Prince Uliami Tugi, the present Premier, and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed on 18th May, 1900.

The present premier, Uliami Tugi, is the Prince Consort, and was formerly Minister for Lands. The progress of Tonga since 1905 has been satisfactory.

Every Tongan is entitled to an allotment of land for cultivation, so that no unemployment exists. Primary education for Tongans between the ages of 6 and 14 is compulsory. There are two boys' colleges at which provision is made for secondary education. Secondary education of girls is entirely in the hands of the Christian missions. Medical work is well organised; and, unlike most native communities in the Pacific, the native population steadily increases in number.

British and foreign nationals charged with any offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment exceeding two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga Courts. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner. Licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British and Australian sterling.

Arrangements were made in 1919 for the issue of Tongan Government Treasury notes. At the end of 1937, £2, 10s., 1l., and 5l. notes were in circulation to the value of 25,073l. The issue is secured by an investment reserve. The Treasury Notes Act, 1935, adopts the exchange standard system based on Australian currency.

There are no private banks in the Kingdom. A Government Savings Bank was established in 1926. At the end of 1937 there were 1,634 depositors and 20,242l. in deposits.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 sq. miles. The non-native population is about 2,000 and the native is estimated at 40,000.

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, Seventh Day Adventists and Church of Christ, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia and by the Roman Catholic Church.

offence against the laws of Tonga, not including crimes punishable by death or by imprisonment exceeding two years, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tonga Courts. In other respects...
The principal exports are copra, cocoa, coffee, rice; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 13th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers, have been appointed. In addition there is a Condominium Staff working in Departments under the joint control of the two Resident Commissioners.

The Customs Tariff in force in the New Hebrides is mainly on an ad valorem basis at varying rates with specific duties in a few cases.

Of the import trade of the group about 68 per cent. is claimed by Australia, 18 per cent. by France, and the remainder by Britain, Japan, China and U.S.A., while the bulk of the exports are shipped to France.

**PITCAIRN ISLAND.**

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (26° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' W. long.). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. Bounty, with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population (at 30th June, 1936) numbers 202 persons.

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. *Chief Magistrate,* R. E. Christian.

The Government is now administered under the High Commissioner, by a Council consisting of a Chief Magistrate, two Assessors, a Secretary and a Chairman of the Internal Committee. These officers are elected annually by the people.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie, and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.

**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.**

**Situation, Area, and Trade.**

The Windward Islands consist of the three islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically, Tobago from 1764 to 1783, and all three in 1838. The three first-named islands are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the three Colonies is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and their estimated population at the census of 24th April, 1921, 162,264.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776, and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1885, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white and there are some Indian Coolies. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois. In Grenada the same condition obtains, but to a less extent.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. A Windward Islands Court of Appeal was set up in 1850 (13 & 14 Vict. c. 15), and abolished in 1920 by an Act (9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 47), which set up a Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica. There is also a common audit system instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada, which have branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

Communications.

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line. The passenger and cargo steamers of the Canadian National Line call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. Government-owned telephones exist throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by wireless, operated by the Pacific Cable Board, and by the Cables of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company Ltd. The rate per word for telegrams to the United Kingdom from Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent is 2s. 4d. The rate to Europe varies from 3s. 2½d. to 3s. 7½d. per word. (Government messages pay half rates.) There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

A wireless installation has been erected at Carriacou by the local Government. It communicates with Grenada and through that island to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, &c., the ordinary tariff being 2d. per word more than from Grenada.

GRENA DA.

Situation, Area, &c.

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 24th April, 1921) of 7,104.

General Description.

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old craters, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former a sanatorium is established. The roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. The surface of the main roads and some of the more important byways is oiled. About 146 miles of main roads, and a network of byways (275 miles), provide good inland communication. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John—while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a Commissioner. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping and had on 31st December, 1937, 147 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,766 tons; its fine harbour owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call for steamers. The town had a population of 4,629 by census of 24th April, 1921.

The other towns in the colony are Gouyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Paure), Sauteurs; Grenville (or Le Baye); and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken, but the peasantry speak among themselves a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the Negro race, except the East Indian population, which was 2,692 in number according to the census of 1921.

Climate.

The climate is good and during the months from December to the end of April, when the trade winds prevail, it is delightful. From July to October there is greater humidity and higher temperature with little variation between night and day. The climate may be regarded as hot during this period but it is not unhealthy at any time during the year. There is an astonishing variation of rainfall. In the mountainous centre it reached 187 inches in 1937 and in the lowlands to the south of the Islands it was as low as 61 inches. The highest shade temperature recorded in 1936 was 90-0 and the lowest 70-0.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. The chief produce of Grenada is cocoa, of which a total value of 160,030l. was shipped in 1937. The modern sugar factory which was erected in 1936 in the southern part of the island manufactures sufficient sugar to meet local demands. No sugar is exported as yet. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such, for instance, as limes, coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, etc. Nutmeg cultivation occupies a prominent position. The value of spices exported in 1937 was 167,159l. Considerable attention is being given also to the production of the Gros Michel banana. In Carriacou cotton is the staple product, its cultivation having never been wholly abandoned there; the value exported in 1937 was, with cotton seed, 4,982l. The cultivation of limes has now been successfully established in Carriacou, the exports of lime products in 1937 amounting to 6,494l. Tropical fruits of almost every description and of the finest quality are fairly plentiful, and are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, tannias, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, bananas, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, etc. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The commercial value of the forests is now being explored. Rum is manufactured for local consumption, the total number of proof gallons in 1937 being 51,329.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit and poultry.

The tariff of import duties is partly on an ad valorem and partly on a specific basis. The rates in the case of the former are mainly 15% on Empire goods and 22½% on foreign goods. The preference on Empire goods is generally 33½%.
The percentages of Trade in 1937 were as follows:

|                | Imports | Exports |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | 48%     | 46%     |
| United States of America | 11      | 24      |
| Canada         | 15      | 10      |
| Other British Possessions | 17      | 11      |
| Other Foreign Countries | 9       | 9       |

100% 100%

The total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou is 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,467.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889, and on 31st December, 1937, the amount at credit of depositors was 49,636£.

A co-operative bank was established in 1932, but there is no agricultural bank in the Colony.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French Company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; and in 1762 it was surrendered to the British under Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1795-6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated by the French Republic. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred by the rebels, and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established in regard to the African slaves, and this was followed in 1838 by their unconditional emancipation.

Constitution.

There was from 1766 a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 21 elected members.

Under an Act of 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100£ a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and Crown Colony Government was established in December, 1877.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

Until the 1st of December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, seven ex-officio members, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members. The Island was divided into five electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

By an Order in Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted; and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Treasurer), four nominated members and seven elected members (one for each of seven electoral districts). At the same time, the Governor is given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards.

Education.

There are 61 elementary schools, 11 Government and 50 aided. These schools are of five classes, Senior, Combined, Junior, Infant and Manual Training Centres. Head teachers of senior and combined schools are paid from 80£ to 160£ per annum, according to their certificates of proficiency, and to the class of school. Bonuses are given them for extra duties. Grants are also given by Government in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. The administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. In 1937 the average attendance was 9,110 children, the number on the rolls being 14,536. There is a Government secondary school for boys, and three for girls which receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue. The total expenditure incurred by Government on primary education for the year 1937 was 11,898£.

The island of St. Columbus, during his June, 1502. It is situated 60° 59' W. long.; at south of Martinique east of St. Vincent; and 14 at its greatest circumference is 150 miles, rather less than northern extremity a military post of sor Castries, the capital rounding district containing 20,798. Next in importance containing with the surrounding population of 7,309.

General Description.

On its final acquisition by the English, the island had become much depopulated, partly by war, but chiefly by internecine struggles, the fruits of the French Revolution. The recovery from this state of things has been slow, having been retarded by the severe epidemics of cholera and small-pox which have at different times visited the West Indies.
Each census, however, has shown an advance in this respect, and the population at 31st December, 1937, is estimated at 67,404. Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but English is gradually becoming more generally used. A very small percentage is of European descent, the remainder being of the negro race, and of East Indian origin. The reputation of the island for peculiar unhealthiness is undeserved, the death rate for 1936 being 14·9 per 1,000, and for the year 1937 14·4 per 1,000. Certain spots situated in narrow valleys between high mountains are undoubtedly unhealthy, but are becoming less and less so as the forests fall before a yearly extending cultivation.

The danger from venomous reptiles is also much exaggerated. Owing to the introduction and spread of the mongoose, snakes are now but rarely met with. Among white inhabitants, consumption and other of the most fatal diseases of temperate climates are almost unknown. The temperature from December to April seldom exceeds 80° Fahr., even at midday, in spots situated a few hundred feet above the sea, and a fresh trade wind blows continuously. The scenery is of peculiar beauty, even as compared with that of other West India Islands, and in the neighbourhood of the Pitons has the less common element of grandeur. These are two cone-shaped rocks rising sheer out of the sea to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and near them is the crater of a volcano and a soufrière, the ordinary characteristics of the Caribbean Cordilleras.

Castries, the chief town, has an excellent harbour. Dredging operations are carried out annually. There is a substantial concrete wharf, 650 feet in length, with a depth alongside of 27 feet at low water. There is another wharf, 540 feet in length, originally constructed in wood, which is gradually being reconstructed in concrete, and is kept dredged to a depth of 14 feet at low water. The facilities offered by the port as a port of call and coaling station are widely recognised. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1937, 18 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 597 tons.

A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and has now 1,028 depositors, with 23,384l. to their credit on 31st December, 1937. Branch savings banks exist at Soufrière and Vieux Fort, Dennery and Gros Islet.

**Constitution and Law.**

Up to the period of the French Revolution, and after the restoration of order in 1800, the island was governed according to the law and ordinances of the French monarchy.

The Government is conducted by an Administrator (who is subordinate to the Governor of the Windward Islands), aided by an Executive Council.

By an Order in Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted, and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Administrator, Attorney-General, and Treasurer), three nominated members, and five elected members (one for each of three electoral districts and two members for a fourth district).

At the same time, the Governor was given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government. Other changes made were the fixing of a common age qualification, twenty-one years, for male and female voters, and a widening of the qualifications of electors.

Law is administered by a Chief Justice-Magistrate from whom as Chief Justice in civil cases there is an appeal to the West Indian Court of Appeal and as Magistrate an appeal to the Commissioner of Appeals. There is one other Magistrate whose decisions are liable to review by the Chief Justice. In criminal cases tried by the Superior Court facts are decided upon by a jury of nine, except in trials for capital offences, when the jury consists of twelve persons as in England.

A code of civil law, the authors of which were Sir G. W. Des Voeux, G.C.M.G., and Mr. James Armstrong, C.M.G., became law in October, 1879. This code was framed upon the principles of the ancient law of the island, with such modifications as are required by existing circumstances. The Statute Law of the Colony was consolidated to 1916 by Mr. F. H. Coller, Chief Justice, who also edited the Commercial Code, 1916.

The revising and editing of the Criminal Law and Procedure of the Colony by Mr. J. E. M. Salmon was completed during 1920 and proclaimed as the Criminal Code, 1920. It came into force on the 1st January, 1921.

**Education.**

On the 30th June, 1891, the trustees of the Lady Mico charity closed the eleven schools which they had till then maintained, and withdrew their connection with the Colony. Three of these schools became Government schools, and the others assisted schools under the new Education Ordinance. In 1898 all the Government schools were handed over to the Roman Catholic body, and became assisted schools. There were, on the 31st December, 1937, 45 assisted schools. Of these, 3 were Anglican, 3 Methodist and 39 Roman Catholic. The number of children on the rolls was 10,159, with an average attendance of 6,986, and the amount spent by the Colony on primary education was 5,086l. The Government grants 460l. a year to a Roman Catholic second-grade school, which has 46 boys on the roll; the Sisters of St. Joseph conduct a similar school for Girls. The number of pupils on the roll is 104 and a Government grant of 175l. is made to the school annually.

As a result of the Mayhew-Marriott Commission of 1932, a Board of Education was constituted on 21st March, 1936, whose chief functions are of an advisory nature.

**Industry, Trade and Customs.**

Limes and lime products, sugar, rum, cocoas, coconuts, bananas, bay oil, bay rum, spices, and Sea Island cotton are produced. There are four sugar factories, 16 lime factories (for the production of lime oils and juices), three rum distilleries, and one bay oil distillery. While all industries show expansion, depending on market conditions, the banana industry has experienced the most rapid and satisfactory rise, shipments in 1937 totalling 110,966 stems, valued at 11,814l.

A fair amount of land in certain districts is in the possession of the Crown, and, under certain conditions, is available for sale for development purposes; the soil will grow any kind of tropical fruit trees or economic plants. Attention is now being paid to the establishment of Land Settlement Schemes with a view to utilising the latent resources of the Colony.

The Customs Import Tariff is mainly on a specific duty basis, with a preference in favour of Empire products which in most cases amounts to one third of the general tariff rate.

The percentage of the Colony's Import Trade with the United Kingdom, other parts of the
British Empire, and the principal foreign countries during 1937 was as follows:

United Kingdom . . . . 40·22 per cent.
Other parts of the British Empire . . . . 24·85 "

Czechoslovakia . . . . 1·14 "
France . . . . 1·24 "
Germany . . . . 1·07 "
Holland . . . . 0·89 "
Japan . . . . 3·26 "

The percentage of the Colony's Export Trade with the United Kingdom, &c., during 1937 was as follows:

United Kingdom . . . . 49·37 per cent.
Other parts of the British Empire . . . . 37·48 "

ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 96,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from Kingstown.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contained at the census of 1931, a population of 4,269 souls. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1937, 26 sailing vessels of a net tonnage of 734 tons and 4 motor vessels of 79 tons net.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Barrouallie on the west.

The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufriere," or volcano, situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rising to about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea. After a violent eruption in 1812, it remained dormant for a period of ninety years, and then broke into violent eruption again on May 7th, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont...
Pélee in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates. The next highest point after the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. In September, 1921, the island was again struck by a hurricane which, although not as violent as its predecessor, did considerable damage to property and crops, entailing considerable hardship on the populace and necessitating the expenditure by Government of £2,284. on relief measures.

Climate.

In the dry season, January to May, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy. The nights are cool all the year round. The rainfall during 1936 was 88.74 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during the same year was 89° F., the lowest 68° F., the mean monthly temperature being 82.2° F. in the shade. The prevailing wind is S.E.

Industry, Trade and Customs.

Sugar, syrup, rum, cocoas, coconuts, copra, bananas, and excellent arrowroot are produced. Arrowroot, the most important product, is graded and exported under the control of a Co-operative Arrowroot Association. The fine quality of the coconuts has resulted in a good demand for St. Vincent whole nuts on the Canadian and U.S.A. markets and a considerable export trade in this commodity has been established in recent years. A Banana Association exists for developing the industry, and marketing the fruit on a co-operative basis. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention. Sea Island cotton, the best in the Empire, is extensively planted, for the ginning of which a Government Ginnery has been erected. There are also three privately owned gunneries. Many of the sugar and arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivable land is owned by a few individuals; portions of Crown lands have been alienated to peasant proprietors, and several estates have been purchased by the Government with the aid of an Imperial grant and allotted to the same class of settlers. The forests have mostly been exploited and except where they are inaccessible contain very few valuable timber trees. There are 65 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne. There are also some 300 miles of byway connecting with the highway.

The port of Kingstown is visited weekly by steamers of the Canadian National Steamships, fortnightly by Steamers of the Ocean Dominion Steamship Corporation and Furness Withy Lines and occasionally by steamers of the Harrison and American Caribbean.

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 3 branch exchanges, with 270 connections and some 446 miles of line.

The import duties are largely ad valorem, mostly 18½ per cent.; but there are many specific duties. Preferential rates, mostly two-thirds of the general rate, are charged on imports from other British countries.

Export duties are levied on cotton, arrowroot, cassava, starch, cocoas, copra and coconuts.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £3,623.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.
From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1796 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1798. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first East Indian Coolie labourers in 1861. Most of them returned to India, but some made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution.**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony, and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three ex officio, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. Until 1st December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, four ex officio members, one nominated unofficial member and three elected members. By the Saint Vincent (Legislative Council) Amendment Order in Council, 1931, the Legislative Council was constituted of the Governor, of three ex officio members, of one nominated official member, of one nominated unofficial member, and of three elected members. The Island was divided into three electoral districts each returning one elected member.

By an Order in Council dated 27th October, 1936, which came into operation on 18th December, 1936, the Legislative Council was reconstituted, and now consists of the Governor, three ex-officio members (the Administrator, Attorney-General, and Treasurer), three nominated members, and five elected members (one for each of five electoral districts).

At the same time, the Governor was given reserve powers for ensuring the passage of legislation, which he considers expedient in the interests of public faith or of good government.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.

**Education.**

There were, on 31st December, 1937, 37 primary schools, with 10,457 children on the rolls. The average attendance during 1937 was 5,972. There is also a government secondary school for boys, and a high school for girls.

An Island Scholarship is awarded triennially tenable for from three to five years at an approved University. Annual value £250l. and cost of passage. An Agricultural Scholarship tenable at the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture is awarded triennially. Annual value £150l.

The Government expenditure on primary education in 1937 was £9,424l.

**Savings Bank.**

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 885 depositors, with £19,897l. deposited, on 31st December, 1937. Branches of the bank have been opened at Georgetown, Barrouallie, and Union Island.

ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is 53 miles long by 24 broad (maximum measurements), and has an area of 640 square miles. To the north-east at a distance of some twenty-five miles lies the island of Pemba in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 42 miles long by 14 broad (maximum measurements), and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The normal annual rainfall in Zanzibar Town amounts to 58-59 inches and in Pemba a mean derived from two stations was 73-26 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined: the heavy rains occur in April and May previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The mean maximum temperature in Zanzibar is 84-4° and the mean minimum 76-6°. The corresponding figures for Pemba are 86-6° and 76-1° respectively.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors of the islands. They founded the clove industry and still possess considerable property in plantations. They understand the natives and the natives understand them and accept their control and that of Europeans more readily than that of other races.

The bulk of the native population numbering 186,000 is known by the generic name of Swahili, a term formerly used to denote the Bantu coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "swahili" in Arabic meaning "coast." This general appellation includes the descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar who intermarried with negro women. They are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern and southern portions of the islands. A quiet shy people, occupied mainly in the cultivation of native crops and fishing, they rarely move from their homes except to pick cloves. The name Swahili also includes the descendants of the early settlers in Pemba who are known as Wapemba. These people engage chiefly in agriculture but raise a smaller variety of native crops than the Wahadimu. Many of them own clove and coconut plantations. They live in less seclusion than the natives on the larger island. Another tribe included in the term are the Watumbatu whose chief stronghold is Tumbatu Island. They are a very exclusive people but by no means shy. They go down to the sea and man most of the craft plying in Zanzibar waters.

There is in addition a considerable influx of various tribes from the mainland, of whom the Wanyamwezi are economically the most important, being now the chief source of supply for the weeding of plantations.

In the 1931 Census the total population of the Protectorate was returned as 235,428. The non-native population numbers 49,000 of whom 33,400 are Arabs. The Khojas, Bohoras, Hindoos, Parsees, and Goans possess most of the trade, either as merchants, shopkeepers, money lenders, small traders, or skilled mechanics.

History and Constitution.

The beginnings of Zanzibar history are lost in antiquity. It appears more than probable that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were known
to the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Jews, but though the expedition of Necho (C. 600 B.C.) doubtless passed the Islands it is not till the first century that the Periplus gives a description of one of them under the name of Menuthias. The Hindus appear to have settled at a very early date and traces of Greek colonisation are not lacking. From about the 7th Century B.C. the islands appear to have had a close connection with the South Arabian States. Bantu settlers probably made their appearance during the first five centuries A.D., and thereafter for the next five hundred years or so came also traders from China and Malaya in addition to those from the Persian Gulf. The Coast was probably converted to Islam early in the 10th Century. The Zenj Empire was founded by Ali bin Hassan, a prince of Shiras, about 975 A.D., but it soon broke up into separate states and, by the time the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral, was already declining. It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1698 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by transferring his capital from Muscat and making the island his permanent residence in the year 1832. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "everybody as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain, and Germany respectively; Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000l. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000l.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the British Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

The Government was vested in a High Commissioner, who was also Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, and a British Resident. The High Commissionership was abolished in 1925.

A Protectorate Council, with His Highness as President, was established at the same time. It was of an advisory and consultative nature and ceased to exist in 1926 when Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted.

Industries and Trade.

Zanzibar is now the dominant partner in the clove industry, holding as it does about 80 per cent of the shares. The other partners are Madagascar, Penang, and the Dutch East Indies.

Authorities differ as to the date when and country from which the clove tree was first introduced into Zanzibar. Some say that it was brought from Réunion by an Arab at the end of the 18th century. Colonel Rigby, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, in his report on the Zanzibar dominions written in the year 1860, states "the first clove trees were introduced about 30 years ago from Mauritius; being found to thrive they were extensively planted and they have now become the most valuable production of these Islands."

To Seyyid Said belongs the credit of establishing and promoting the clove industry. Burton records that he threatened confiscation to those who did not plant three clove trees for every coconut and that the country was almost denuded of the latter to make room for cloves. In 1839-40 the output amounted to about 9,000 frasinas. (The Frasina equivalent to 35 lbs., is the local measure of weight for cloves). In 1849 it had risen to frasinas 120,000. In 1859 frasinas 139,000, valued at 55,666l., were exported, and the average output during the next decade was frasinas 200,000, valued at about 85,000l. Owing to the increase in production the price had, however, fallen from $5-86 to $1-82.

In 1872, a hurricane of great violence swept over the Island of Zanzibar and destroyed two-thirds of the clove and coconut trees. Pemba, though touched by the hurricane, sustained little damage. The years following this disaster were years of short supply, high prices, and intensive cultivation. The Pemba owners, actuated by motives of gain, hastened to cut down coconut trees on a wholesale scale throughout the island and to plant clove trees in their place. The Zanzibar owners, though temporarily ruined, set to work with commendable fortitude to replace the trees which the hurricane had destroyed, and ten years after the hurricane the normal output of cloves had not only been restored but increased.

Another event of great economic importance to the industry was the abolition of slavery. The
industry was built up and for many years sustained on slave labour imported from the interior of Africa. In 1873 Seyyid Bargash entered into a treaty to suppress the sea-borne traffic in slaves and to close all public markets in his dominions for the buying or selling of imported slaves. Various treaties and legislative measures followed until the year 1897, when by a decree of Seyyid Hamoud the legal status of slavery was abolished. It may be noted parenthetically that in the year 1890 Great Britain assumed a protectorate over Zanzibar.

The history of labour subsequent to 1897 is a tale of shortage, disinclination on the part of the labour available to engage in any form of settled work, inability or disinclination on the part of the Arabs to pay money wages, and administrative effort to organize the available supply. The introduction of Indian labour was at one time or another canvassed but never materialized. In 1904 and 1906 and at other subsequent times recourse was had to recruitment of labour on the mainland. Mainlanders have also come voluntarily, settled in appreciable numbers, and are now the chief source of supply for cultivation of plantations.

Since the abolition of slavery no event of major economic importance has occurred. There have been the usual ups and downs, but production has increased. 121,128 cwts. of cloves valued at approximately 411,654l. were exported in 1937.

A Clove Growers' Association, established in 1927, was incorporated by decree in 1934. Its major object is the marketing of cloves.

The coconut industry ranks next in importance after cloves, the conditions in both Islands being favourable to the growth of the tree and its nut-bearing properties. It is estimated that there are about 55,000 acres under cultivation and 3½ million trees in both Islands. The export of domestic copra amounted to 14,411 tons valued at approximately 204,000l., and in addition coconuts and coconut oil to the value of 4,200l. were exported. Much is produced by the small grower or trader, neither of whom possesses proper drying facilities, with the result that the quality of the product compares unfavourably with that of Ceylon.

As a preliminary to a grading scheme a Decree to prevent the adulteration of produce was applied to copra, an improvement in the general quality being apparent by the end of the year.

There is a general ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. on imported goods with the exception of certain articles which have either a specific duty or a higher ad valorem duty, such as spirits, motor spirits, kerosene, cigarettes, tobacco, matches, tea, milk, cotton and artificial silk piece goods, shirts, singlets, boots and shoes, etc. There is also a schedule of articles exempt from duty. The Tariff includes no provisions for Empire preference.

The principal articles of import are rice and grain, cotton piece goods, motor spirit and petroleum, sugar, tobacco, manufactured (including cigars and cigarettes), flour, ghee, sesame, cattle, dried fish, bags and sacks and straw bags.

The principal articles of export (including re-exports) are cloves, copra, cotton piece goods, rice and grain, motor spirit and petroleum, ivory, millet, and simeim.

The following are the percentages of imports from and exports to principal countries of origin and destination during the year 1937:

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Sha. 20s. = 1l.) with the following subsidiary coinage:—50 cts. (silver) and 10 cts., 5 cts., 1 cts. (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon. The amount in circulation at 31st December, 1937, was notes 266,100l. and coin 223,344l.

Two British Banks maintain branches in the territory:—The National Bank of India, Limited; The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited; both at Zanzibar.

There are also two private Indian banking firms:—Messrs Jetha Lila : Mr. Saleh Gangji.

There are no agricultural or co-operative banks, but the Protectorate Government has assisted in the finance of the clove industry by granting loans to members of the Clove Growers' Association on the security of chattel mortgages and of produce deposited for storage.

There is a Government Savings Bank with 6,665 depositors at the end of 1937 and total deposits of 80,578l.

Shipping and Communications.

The port of Zanzibar is one of the finest in Africa, and was for long a main centre of commerce between India, Arabia, and the mainland. Of late years, however, the importance of Zanzibar as a port of trans-shipment and distributing centre has largely decreased owing to the development of the mainland, to the opening up of the coast ports to direct steamship service with Europe, and to
the transfer to Aden of the seat of trade with the 
Benadir coast. Recent figures, nevertheless, tend 
to indicate that the Island will continue, by 
reason of its geographical position, to retain 
control of the local traffic.

It possesses an excellent water supply, the best 
on the East Coast of Africa. A considerable 
quantity is supplied to shipping annually.

The British India Steam Navigation Company 
maintain a monthly service between London—
Zanzibar—Beira, the Union Castle Mail Steamer-
Company a monthly service London—Zanzibar—
London round Africa in alternate directions, the Bank 
Line a monthly service Calcutta—Zanzibar—Cape 
Town, the Clan—Ellerman—Harrison Line between 
Glasgow—Liverpool—Zanzibar—Beira (cargo only), 
the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes a fort-
nightly service Marseilles—Zanzibar—Madagascar—
Mauritius, the German East African Line a monthly 
service Hamburg—Zanzibar—Durban—Hamburg in 
alternate directions, the Holland Africa Line a 
monthly service Rotterdam—Zanzibar—Rotterdam 
round Africa in alternate directions, Royal Packet 
Steamship Co. a monthly service between Java and 
Zanzibar, the Lloyd Triestino a monthly service 
from Italy to Cape Town via Suez and back. The 
British India Steam Navigation Company also 
maintain a fortnightly service Bombay—Zanzibar—
Durban, also a coastal service Lamu—Zanzibar—
Mikindani, the Osaka Shosen Kaisha a monthly 
service Kobe—Zanzibar—Durban and South America. 
The American South African Line maintain a monthly 
service between Zanzibar and New York via South 
Africa, the Robin Line also a monthly service 
between Zanzibar and New York via South Africa.

Government steamers maintain regular weekly 
connection with Pemba and Dar-es-salaam. Zanzibar 
has become a port of call in the itinerary of a number 
of large tourist steamers.

There is cable communication with Europe 
either via Aden or via Durban.

There are 165'8 miles of roads throughout the 
Island of Zanzibar and 73'8 miles in Pemba 
suitable for motor traffic. The Government 
maintains wireless stations and telephone systems 
in Zanzibar and Pemba.

There are 7 post offices in the two Islands.

There is a regular thrice weekly air service 
(passenger and mail) between Zanzibar, Dar-es-salaam 
and Tangai in Tanganyika Territory and Mombasa 
and Nairobi in Kenya Colony, which connects with 
the Imperial airways service at Mombasa and 
Dar-es-salaam for destinations on the London to 
Durban air route. This feeder service is maintained 
by a private Company operating from Nairobi, 
Kenya Colony.

Constitution and Government.

The Government is administered by a British 
Resident, who is appointed by commission under 
His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, and exercises 
his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 
1924.

The law of the Protectorate consists of Orders in 
Council, the Decrees of the Sultan, and certain 
Imperial Statutes of general application. His 
Highness's Decrees and legislation subsidiary thereto, 
when countersigned by the British Resident under 
Article 42 of the Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, 
are binding upon all persons. The Muhammedan 
Law, declared civil matters to be the fundamental 
law of His Highness's Dominions, controls in some 
measure personal relationships.

There are Executive and Legislative Councils, 
established by the Sultan's Decree Cap. 28 (R.L.2., 
1934).

Justice, in cases in which persons subject to the 
Zanzibar Order-in-Council, 1924, are concerned, is 
administered by H.B.M.'s High Court and the 
Court's subordinate to it, and in other cases by 
H.H. the Sultan's Court for Zanzibar and the Courts 
subordinate to that Court. Subordinate Courts are 
held by Resident Magistrates, Administrative Officers, 
and Arab Katisis. In addition, District Courts, 
composed of benches of local headmen, exercise a 
limited criminal jurisdiction. An Appeal lies from 
the British Court and from the Zanzibar Court in the 
exercise of their original civil and criminal jurisdiction 
to His Majesty's Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa 
and thence to the Privy Council.

NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitang River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of about 29,347 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 26' N. lat. The southern frontier was delimited in 1912-1913 by an Anglo-Dutch boundary commission, whose report was confirmed by a treaty at London on the 28th September, 1915.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan, Lahad Datu, and Tawan, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. The capital and headquarters of administration are at Sandakan. Other stations are at Semporna, Lamag, Beluran, Langkon, Kotabelud, Tuaran, Penampang, Papar, Beaufort, Mempakul, Sipitang, Tenom, Keningau, Tambunan, Ranau, and Pensiangan.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly rubber, tobacco, coconuts, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, and pepper.

The country is mountainous. The highest point is Kinabalu, over 13,000 feet.

The inhabitants, who at the Census taken in 1931 numbered 270,223, are mainly Bruneis, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade. Further back, the Dusuns, the most numerous native race in North Borneo, cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields, and in the uplands they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt. The Muruts, another interior tribe, are numerous; formerly they varied more peaceful pursuits by head-hunting, but are now peaceable. The Chinese population is steadily increasing and is now not far short of 48,000; they form the trading, gardening and artisan section of the community. There is a State-aided scheme of Chinese immigration. Europeans number about 400. Sandakan, the chief town, with suburbs, has a population of about 17,600. There are several missions, including the Church of England, with stations at Sandakan, Kudat, and Jesselton, and the Roman Catholic with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast and twenty-one schools in various parts of the country. The Church of England, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and seven schools elsewhere. The Basel Mission has sixteen schools, the principal ones being at Jesselton, Sandakan, Kudat, and Papar. Government maintains sixteen vernacular schools at various places in the territory.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1620, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1606, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balambangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a Company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (afterwards Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as the State of North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of the British Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°; but there is
usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 150 inches, according to situation.

Annual Mean Temperature... 81 degrees
Recorded extremes maximum 96 "
" " minimum 60 "

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are two Residencies, viz., the East Coast and West Coast Residencies.

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based upon Indian law and the principal Indian Codes have been adopted in the State. Many enactments of the Straits Settlements also have been incorporated in local Ordinances. Courts of law are correlative to the Indian Courts under the Indian Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes, while there are Imams' Courts for the administration of Moslem matrimonial law, and Native Courts to deal with matters of native custom.

Industry.

The principal products of the country are estate rubber, timber, copra, and cutch. The rapid expansion of the rubber industry is indicated by the increase in exports of the commodity from 24 tons in 1910 to 13,213 tons in 1937. The vast timber resources of the country form one of its principal assets; until 1920 only the fringe of the forests was worked, but in that year a company was formed for more adequate timber exploitation with modern lumbering apparatus. At Sandakan two large steam-driven sawmills have been working for some years; there are also a modern band sawmill and an electrically driven sawmill. Exports of timber in 1937 were valued at 331,589l.; the principal markets were Hong Kong, China, Japan and Great Britain. The number of coconut plantations has rapidly increased in the last two decades and exports of copra have risen considerably; in 1937 the value of copra shipped was 89,042l. Cutch, a tanning material obtained from the bark of certain mangrove trees, is manufactured at Sandakan; exports in 1937, 37,272l. Tobacco grows well; extensive areas were formerly cultivated by European companies with the special variety used for the wrappers of cigars, but this industry has waned. The natives also engage in the cultivation of tobacco, but the principal crop grown by them is rice, the production of which is however still insufficient to meet local demands. The fishing industry gives employment to a large number of natives; exports of dried and salt fish in 1937 were valued at 51,193l. Sago is manufactured and exported. Other articles of export are damar, livestock, edible birds' nests collected in certain limestone caves, firewood, rattans, charcoal, and seed pearls. Fruit growing is an important industry and increasing attention is being given to the cultivation of manila hemp, coffee, and pepper, all of which thrive.

The Chartered Company does not itself directly engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, excise, quit rents, licences, royalties, poll tax, and other usual sources of revenue.

Sandakan on the East and Jesselton on the West are the principal ports. Both towns have developed rapidly, and are now supplied with electric light and cold storage. Considerable sums have been spent by Government on reclamation, improvement of water supplies, etc., at both ports.

Large resources of coal exist in the country behind Cowie Harbour in the south east and seams occur elsewhere in the territory. Gold in alluvial form is found in certain of the rivers on the East Coast.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. Indications of the presence of petroleum occur in many parts of the State, but so far it has not been found to exist in commercial quantity; prospecting work is still proceeding.

Customs Tariff.

Customs duties are leviable in North Borneo both on an ad valorem and a specific basis. The prevailing ad valorem duty rates are 5 per cent. and 10 per cent.; chiefly the latter.

A preferential import tariff (varying from one-third to three-quarters of the general tariff import rates) came into force on 10th October, 1933, applicable to certain specified goods imported from any part of the British Empire. Following Colonial practice, as in the United Kingdom, a proportion of 25 per cent. of Empire material, labour, etc., is required in most cases, and of 50 per cent. in a selected few.

The rates of duty on the most important articles are as follows:

| Article | Preferential | General Tariff |

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes. There is also a silver coin of 25 cents. The State Bank of North Borneo has its head office at Sandakan. There are agencies of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and the Bank of Taiwan.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Means of Communication.

The Straits Steamship Company run steamers every week between Singapore and local ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Hong Kong, Japan, and the Dutch East Indies, and a local company maintains a service along the coast and to the Philippine Islands. The State Railway on the West Coast, which is a metre gauge line, connects Jesselton with Beaufort, 57 miles distant. At Beaufort the line divides, one section proceeding to the port of Weston (20 miles), the other to Malalap in the interior (40 miles). In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 124 miles. At Jesselton there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 1,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. There is a first class metalled road 20 miles long, from Jesselton to Tuaran; this is now being extended a further 16 miles to Tenghilin. Another road proceeds from Sandakan in a north-western direction, 15 miles of metalling have been completed and earthworks to mile 19. Road construction is being pushed forward in other localities of the State. At the end of 1937, the total mileage of metalled and earth roads outside municipal limits was 236 miles. There is a system of bridlepaths covering a total distance of 800 miles. Wireless stations exist at Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, and Lahad Datu. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of letter post from London, about fourteen days. Postage to certain British possessions for letters 12 cents for the first half-oz., 6 cents for each succeeding half-oz.; others 8 cents for the first oz., 4 cents each succeeding oz.; foreign countries, 12 cents for the first oz., 6 cents each succeeding oz.

On the completion of the Singapore-Labuan-Hong Kong cable in 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakul.

There is a telegraph line from Mempakul where the cable reaches land to Jesselton, whence messages are transmitted by radiotelegraphy to Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, and Lahad Datu. Branch telegraph lines establish communication with Beaufort and Tenom from Jesselton. The majority of the smaller Government stations are in telephonic communication with one another and with the local centres of administration. Telephone exchanges are in operation at Jesselton, Sandakan, and Kudat.

SARAWAK.

General.

In 1864 Great Britain recognized Sarawak as an independent State. An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 50,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 442,900 composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 450 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kedurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kedurong Point and the Barum River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter: and in 1884 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, the transfer being approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1905. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born 26th September 1874, married, 1911, Hon. Sylvia Brett), succeeded his father, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., in 1917.

Heir presumptive, Bertram Brooke (H.H. the Tuan Muda), born 8th August, 1876.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses hospitals and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 480 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under four resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

The S.P.G., and Roman Catholic Missions have stations at various other places all over the Country.

Sibu, on the Rojang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 137,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Mukah, a large town on the Mukah River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

There are roads around the capital and thence to Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles) and to Sadong (about 40 miles). Internal communication is almost entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.
