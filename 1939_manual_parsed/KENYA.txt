KENYA COLONY AND PROTECTORATE.

Extent and Administration.

The territories comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East Africa Protectorate, include the whole of the East African coastline from Umba River to Dick's Head, and territories in the interior bounded in part by international convention lines. The eastern boundary was defined along the Juba and north-east by an agreement with Italy (1891), and on the north by an agreement with Abyssinia in 1908, but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a Commission was appointed to adjust the eastern and north-eastern boundaries. On the west, the Colony adjoins the Uganda Protectorate, and on the south the mandated Tanganyika Territory. The British East Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on November 19th, 1890. In March, 1891, the Imperial British East Africa Company undertook the administration of the country, from which they withdrew in 1893.

The Kenya Protectorate consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the Tanganyika mandated Territory frontier to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago. In respect of these territories Kenya pays a rent of 10,000£ per annum to the Sultan of Zanzibar.

The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1906, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By an Order in Council dated 9th November, 1906, the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and the Order in Council of 22nd October, 1906, constituted Executive and Legislative Councils. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), but the latter has now been varied by the cession of Jubaland to Italy under the Treaty with the Italian Government dated 24th July, 1924. All Foreign Consular Jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British Court.

By the "Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1926," the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were recognised as a Colony. This Order in Council came into operation on the 23rd July, 1920, and the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya. The area of the Protectorate and Colony of Kenya is about 224,960 square miles.

The Colony and Protectorate is divided into four Provinces, and three extra-provincial districts.

1. The Nyasa Province, comprising the districts of North Kavirondo, South Kavirondo, Central Kavirondo, Kericho, and Kisumu-Londiani.
2. The Rift Valley Province comprising the districts of Nakuru, Rayme, Baringo, Naivasha, Lakiapia, Nandi, Usain Gishu, Elgeyo, and Trans-Uzoia.
3. The Central Province comprising the districts of Nairobi, Kyambu, Fort Hall, South Nyeri, North Nyeri, Embu, Maru, Machakos, and Kitui.
4. The Coast Province comprising the districts of Digo, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and Lamu.

5. The Northern Frontier District comprising the districts of Isiolo, Marsabit, Moyale, Wajir, and Telekugger.
6. The Turkana District, comprising the districts of Turkana and West Suk.
7. The Massai District, comprising the districts of Ngong and Kajiado.

The Capital of the Colony is Nairobi. A Municipality has been established here in respect of a population estimated as under:

| Year | Europeans | Asiatics | Natives |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 1937 |           |          |         |
|      |           |          |         |
|      |           |          |         |

Mombasa is the principal port; the inhabitants number about 50,000, of whom about 1,200 are Europeans. Mombasa is an island of about seven square miles in area and has two harbours, Mombasa harbour on the eastern side and Kilindini harbour to the south-west. There is a lighthouse and signal station at the entrance to the port. A Municipality was established at Mombasa in 1928.

Population.

The total population is estimated at 31st December, 1937, as follows:

| Category       | Number   |
|----------------|----------|
| Europeans      | 19,211   |
| Indians        | 42,368   |
| Arabs          | 13,660   |
| Goans          | 3,658    |
| Other non-natives | 1,605   |
| Total non-natives | 90,502   |
| Africans       | 3,263,689|
| Total          | 3,334,191|

On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Nilotic Kavirondo, the Nandi, the Lumbwa, the Suk, the Turkana, the Massai, the Somalis, and the Gallas.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made some progress. There are in the Colony and Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing thirteen different societies—British, French, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts.

Constitution.

Under the Royal Instructions dated the 29th March, 1934, amended on 26th May, 1938, the Executive Council of the Colony consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Chief Native Commissioner (ex-officio members), such other persons holding office in the public service of the Colony as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President. There are four such unofficial members. It is further provided that the Legislative Council of the Colony shall consist of the Governor as President, eleven ex-officio members, not more than nine nominated official members, eleven European elected members, five Indian elected members, one Arab elected member, two nominated unofficial members to represent the interests of the African community.
and one nominated unofficial member to represent the interests of the Arab community. The ex-officio members are the ex-officio members of the Executive Council, with the Commissioner for Lands and Settlement, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, Director of Education, General Manager of the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, Director of Public Works, and Commissioner of Customs.

By the "Kenya Protectorate Order in Council 1920," it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, and various other places. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. The legal status of slavery has been abolished throughout the Colony and Protectorate.

The 1924 ordinance governing the election of European, Indian and Arab members to the Legislative Council was consolidated and amended in 1935, but not brought into operation until 1937, when new registers of voters were compiled for the general elections which took place in 1938. Under amendments to the 1924 ordinance the boundaries of several of the eleven European electoral areas had been altered, and certain areas renamed. These were continued in the 1935 ordinance, which, however, provided for three Indian electoral areas (two each to return two members and the other one) in place of the whole country forming one constituency returning five members. For Arabs, the whole country is still one constituency. The Indian and Arab franchise, like the Europeans, is adult (over 21 years) suffrage, except that in the latter case it is made subject to the ability to write Arabic or Swahili in Arabic characters.

By the enactment in 1924 of the Native Authority Amendment Ordinance a considerable measure of local self-government was conferred on the various Native Councils in Kenya in regard to the social welfare of the tribes and the management of communal matters such as land, forests, veterinary services, etc., as well as the local control of health, education, agriculture, trade and labour recruitment. Ordinances passed in 1928 aim at the extension of local government in municipalities and settled areas.

East Africa Governors' Conference.

In pursuance of a recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission which visited E. Africa in 1924, a first Conference of Governors of the British East African Dependencies was held in Nairobi in January and February, 1926, for the discussion of matters of mutual concern. It was then decided that a permanent Secretariat for the Conference should be established at Nairobi and conferences held as and when necessary. Subsequently the Joint Select Committee on Closer Union in East Africa recommended that the machinery of the Governors' Conference should be increasingly utilised for the purpose of ensuring continuous and effective cooperation and co-ordination in all matters of common interest to East Africa. As a result of this, it was decided that the Conference should be deemed to be in permanent session with a view to its being convened at any time when necessary, and that there should in any case be an annual meeting of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika Territory and Uganda, attended, if desired, by the Governors of Northern Rhodesia, Nyassaland, and the British Resident, Zanzibar. The cost of the Secretariat is contributed in varying proportions by the East African Governments and by the Kenya and Uganda Railway Administration. The Secretary is also Secretary to the Transport Policy Board, of which the members are the Governors of Kenya, Uganda and the Tanganyika Territory, and to the High Commissioner for Transport, Kenya and Uganda. Secretary : H. L. G. Gurney, Salary 1,260l. Assistant Secretary : H. G. Richards (seconded from Provincial Administration, Tanganyika Territory).

Climate.

With the exception of the coast and the immediate interior where the average temperature is about 80°F., the climate of Kenya is cool and invigorating. At Nairobi, the mean temperature is 67°F., the mean maximum being 77°F. and the mean minimum 57°F. There are generally two rainy seasons : the "long rains" of April to June when the greater part of the rain falls, and the "short rains" of October to December, but in the high area west of the Rift Valley and north of the railway the wettest months are April to August. No month is invariably dry, and near Lake Victoria showers occur on most afternoons. The mean annual rainfall on the coast is 40 inches, of which 20 inches may fall in April and May. Inland the rainfall decreases to 10 inches and then increases with altitude to an average of 40 inches over the Highlands. On higher ground and near the Lake average annual totals reach 70 inches.

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin is the East African shilling (silver) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations :- 50 cents (silver) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). A note issue is maintained and notes of the following denominations are in circulation :- Sha. 10,000, 1,000, 200, 100, 20, 10 and 5.

The currency is controlled by the East African Currency Board, London, which replaced the old local Board of Currency Commissioners in 1921. The Board is represented in the Colony by local Currency Officers.

The National Bank of India Ltd. (Head Office, 26 Bishopsgate Street, London) are bankers to the Government of Kenya, with branches in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu, and at Kampala, Entebbe, and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

The Standard Bank of South Africa, Ltd. (Head Office :- 10 Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, London) has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Eldoret, Nakuru, Kisumu, Nyeri, Nanyuki, Kitale, Kakamega in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) with which is amalgamated the National Bank of South Africa Ltd. has branches at Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru, Kitale, Eldoret, Kisumu, and Kakamega in Kenya, and at Kampala and Jinja in the Uganda Protectorate.

Land and Products.

As the pursuit of agriculture is possible from sea level to altitudes of over 9,000 feet, a wide range of commodities is produced.

In the areas above 5,000 feet, coffee, tea, maize, wattle bark, pyrethrum and wheat are the principal crops. Below this altitude sisal fibre, cotton and oilseeds are most important. Other crops grown in various parts of the Colony include beans, potatoes, millets, coconuts, cashew nuts, sugar cane, vegetables and fruit.
Extensive pasture grounds exist under conditions extending from semi-arid to moist temperate. Large herds of cattle and sheep are maintained and considerable quantities of hides and skins and of butter are exported annually. An export trade in preserved meat is being built up.

The local market is well supplied with the main food staples and also with a tempting variety of specialities of local production and preparation.

The export trade in agricultural and pastoral products reached a total value of £3,200,629l. in 1937, as compared with £3,278,662l. in 1936, and £2,510,215l. in 1935.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and on Lake Victoria and an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The forest products of the Coast are mangrove poles and bark, timber, ebony, and gum copal. The highland forests contain large quantities of pencil Cedar and several other good timbers such as Podocarpus, Olive, and East African Camphor, also large areas of bamboo suitable for the manufacture of high quality paper pulp.

The following minerals have been located:

Gold has been found throughout the Nyanza Province, and in the southern part of Masai Reserve. Traces of gold are widespread in rocks of the basement complex.

Silver is commonly associated with the gold discoveries and also occur with base metals in the Coastal Province.

Copper, associated with pegmatite in basement complex gneiss is being investigated in the Teita district. A considerable deposit has also been reported in Nyanza Province.

Corundum occurs in considerable quantities in Machakos district.

Lead and zinc are found in the Coastal Province.

Asbestos occurs in basement complex rocks at a certain horizon, the best known occurrences being in Machakos and West Suk districts.

Arsenic occurs in the form of arsenical pyrite in the Nyanza Province.

Beryl has been found in Machakos District.

Barytes is found in the Coastal Province.

Cinnabar has been discovered at the Coast.

Diatomite is found near Gilgiti and in many other parts where lacustrine beds occur.

Gypsum has been discovered near Simba.

Graphite occurs in varying concentrations in basement complex schists.

Iron Magnetite-quartzites occur in the basement complex and form a possible ore for the future.

Ilmenite (Titanium). The sand is abundantly concentrated in the rivers of the Nyanza Province.

Kyanite in long crystals occurs in Machakos District.

Limestone. Abundant in Coastal Province. Recrystallised as marble it occurs in enormous quantities near Voi, Kajiado, in Loldaika Hills and other places.

Manganese occurs in the Coastal Province.

Magnesite occurs associated with some of the Machakos district asbestos.

Mica occurs in basement complex rocks. It has been worked in West Suk and in the Ukamba Reserve.

Marble is being exploited at Kajiado.

Optical Quartz of good quality has been located in an alluvial deposit in Machakos.

Olivine is concentrated in the rivers draining the Aberdare.

Potash and Soda. These salts are being exploited at Lake Magadi.

Tin. Cassiterite has been discovered in Trans Nzoia.

Vermiculite is known to occur in Machakos.

Sapphire. Parts of the corundum deposit in Machakos have yielded small pieces of gem sapphire. Zircon is an abundant constituent in the river beds of Nyanza, but is particularly plentiful in the streams draining the Coastal Range.

The total area of land alienated as at December 31st, 1937, was 6,987,498 acres. In addition, there are 271,360 acres of Township and Government Reserves.

Trade, Customs and Excise.

Under the terms of the Congo Basin Treaties equality of treatment in respect of imported goods irrespective of origin is ensured, and the grant of Imperial Preference is therefore inadmissible. Goods declared as in transit are allowed to be imported and forwarded under Customs control on payment of expenses of administration (6d. per package).

For purposes of Customs, Kenya and Uganda form a single unit and by agreement with the Tanganyika Territory Government a common Tariff has been accepted by the three territories, the free and unrestricted movement within the territories of both imported goods and local products being thus secured.

The Common Tariff, however, includes a small number of "suspended duties" which are of a protective nature and may be imposed by Proclamation either in part or in full in any or all of the territories.

The general duty rating under the Common Tariff is 20 per cent. ad valorem based on the landed value at the port of entry, building materials, artisans' tools, and vehicles and parts being admitted at lower ratings. Specific duties are imposed on such articles as readily lend themselves to this form of assessment and in certain cases alternative specific or ad valorem charges are levied. Exemption from duty is allowed on drugs and medicines, packing materials, disinfectants, germicides and vermin killers, machinery, and many articles necessary for road construction, sanitation, irrigation and drainage purposes, and for the agricultural, industrial, and educational development of the territories.

For Kenya and Uganda, the value of Trade Imports (excluding imports on Government Account, railway material and goods in transit and transhipment) and of exports (domestic and foreign) and the net amount of Customs receipts from all sources and the tonnage entered at Kenya Ports, were as follows:

| Year | Imports | Exports | Receipts | Net Tonnage |

Communication between the coastal ports of the Protectorate is maintained by steamers belonging to the B.I.S.N. Co.

The Kenya and Uganda Railway was formerly worked as a State Railway of Kenya Colony, but in 1921 it was decided that from 1st April this line together with all branch lines and steamer services both in Kenya and Uganda should be controlled by an Inter-Colonial Railway Council, consisting of a chairman and one official and one unofficial member from each Territory (Kenya and Uganda), and that railway surpluses should not be available for general colonial revenue purposes.

On the 3rd February, 1926, the Kenya and Uganda (Transport) Order-in-Council, 1925, came into force, by which was established the office of High Commissioner for Transport for the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya and the Protectorate of Uganda. It provided that this office should be held by the Officer administering the Government of Kenya, and that he should have the control of the transport services owned, controlled, or managed, by the Governments of either of the two Territories, including railways, ports, wharves and steamships; the services were to be known as the Kenya and Uganda Railway.

The Order-in-Council further provided for the constitution of a Kenya and Uganda Railway Advisory Council to consist of not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Kenya, and not more than two official and two unofficial members representing Uganda, each territory's representatives, official and unofficial, to be appointed by the respective Governors; and it directed that a Railway and Harbour Fund should be formed, into which was to be paid all revenue derived from the administration of the services, and from which all disbursements were to be made.

By an amending order in Council, dated the 13th August, 1935, the High Commissioner for Transport now consists of (a) the Officer Administering the Government of Kenya and (b) the Officer Administering the Government of Uganda acting, save where specifically otherwise provided therein, jointly or in conference.

The length of the line, which is metre gauge, including branches open to traffic at the end of 1937 is 1,622 miles, excluding loops and industrial sidings.

The Railway Marine consists of the Lake Victoria, Lake Kioga, Lake Albert, and River Nile flotillas. Their respective strengths are as follows:

Lake Victoria, 3 Steamers, total displacement 3,646 tons.
4 Tugs and 2 Launches.
2 motor vessels (Kagera River and Kavirondo Gulf Services).
37 Lighters, total capacity 4,340 tons.

Lake Kioga, 3 Sternwheel Steamers, total displacement 468 tons.
17 Lighters, total capacity 1,900 tons.

Lake Albert and River Nile 4 Steamers, total displacement 1,256 tons.
1 Launch.
7 Lighters, total capacity 420 tons.

The following figures include all services both in Kenya and Uganda—
Total Expenditure on Capital Account at the end of 1937 . . 22,151,873l.

Revenue for 1937—
Railways . . . . . . . . 2,715,524l.
Harbours . . . . . . . . 513,241l.

Ordinary Working Expenditure excluding Loan and Redemption Charges, for 1937—
Railways . . . . . . . . 1,261,278l.
Harbours . . . . . . . . 199,487l.

No. of Passengers carried (Revenue earning) 771,471l.

Goods carried (Revenue earning) Tons . . . . . . . . 1,036,908l.

Total Steamer Mileages (all three services) . . . . . . . . 183,774l.

In 1927 the title of the Kenya and Uganda Railway was changed to that of Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours, and the Administration assumed control of the working of the Port of Mombasa and coastal ports.

The old harbour at Mombasa is now entirely used by dhows. Kilindini Harbour, at the Port of Mombasa, is the finest land-locked and sheltered harbour on the East Coast of Africa; it possesses an ample water supply. It has been the scene of intensive development during recent years, and some £1 million pounds sterling have been expended there. There is now, in addition to the former lighterage quay, a deep-water quay having a length of approximately 3,000 feet. This quay can accommodate six ships alongside of the normal type using the port. The quay is served by 25 electric level-lifting cranes and there are five transit sheds, three of which are double storey. The total number of quay, shed and stacking ground cranes are 82 up to date. Bulk oil from ships is discharged to tanks ashore at a special jetty. Another jetty, formerly owned by the Magadi Soda Co., has been acquired by the Port, together with the sheds and conveyors, and this berth is now used for loading commodities other than soda.

A Harbour Advisory Board, set up under the authority of an Order in Council enacted in December, 1927, advises the High Commissioner for Transport on port matters.

The principal river flowing into the Indian Ocean is the Tana, which is navigable for about 400 miles by small shallow draft steamers. The bar at Kipini is an obstacle to navigation from the sea.

The Port of Kilifi consists of a land-locked Harbour, 30 miles North-East of Mombasa. It offers good anchorage for small vessels, and opens out into the Bandari Ya Wali, a bay about one-and-half miles wide, with shallow anchorage.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Kilifi.

The Port of Malindi is an open Harbour, 60 miles North East of Mombasa. Ships of any size can anchor off Malindi, but the anchorage is very exposed to the Monsoons. Cotton, Sim sim, and Copra are exported.

A District Officer resides at Malindi.

About three miles North of Malindi is the mouth of the Sabaki River. This river, which has recently been bridged about a mile from its mouth, passes through a country of great fertility, but is shallow and only navigable by canoes.

The Port of Lamu lies between Lamu and Manda Islands, 140 miles North-East of Mombasa. The town of Lamu, the most important Coast town North of Mombasa, is situated on Lamu Island. There is a good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, but the bar carries only 15 feet at low water. The exports are cocoa-nuts, copra, rope, mat bags, and some cattle.

There is a District Commissioner in residence at Lamu.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The services are operated by Empire Flying Boats thrice weekly to Kisumu and twice weekly to Durban via Mombasa. Feeder services connect Kisumu and Nairobi and fly down the overland route to Luasaka.

A coastal Air Mail feeder service, linking Dar-es-Salaam, Zanzibar and Mombasa with Nairobi and the Empire Service is operated by a local company—Wilson Airways, Limited. Scheduled mail and passenger carrying services to mining and other areas are operated by Wilson Airways, which in addition undertakes an increasing amount of taxi flying.
