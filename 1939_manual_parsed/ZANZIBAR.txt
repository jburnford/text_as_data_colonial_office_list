ZANZIBAR.

Situation and Area.

The island of Zanzibar is situated in 6° S. latitude and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. It is 53 miles long by 24 broad (maximum measurements), and has an area of 640 square miles. To the north-east at a distance of some twenty-five miles lies the island of Pemba in 5° S. latitude. It is smaller than Zanzibar, being 42 miles long by 14 broad (maximum measurements), and having an area of 380 square miles.

Climate.

The normal annual rainfall in Zanzibar Town amounts to 58-59 inches and in Pemba a mean derived from two stations was 73-25 inches. The rainy seasons are well defined: the heavy rains occur in April and May previous to the setting in of the south-west monsoon, the light rains in November and December before the recurrence of the north-east monsoon. The mean maximum temperature in Zanzibar is 84·4° and the mean minimum 76·6°. The corresponding figures for Pemba are 86·6° and 76·1° respectively.

People.

The Arabs were the conquerors of the islands. They founded the clove industry and still possess considerable property in plantations. They understand the natives and the natives understand them and accept their control and that of Europeans more readily than that of other races.

The bulk of the native population numbering 186,000 is known by the generic name of Swahili, a term formerly used to denote the Bantu coast tribes from Somaliland to Mozambique, "sawahil" in Arabic meaning "coast." This general appellation includes the descendants of the early settlers of the island of Zanzibar who intermarried with negro women. They are called Wahadimu and live on the eastern and southern portions of the islands. A quiet shy people, occupied mainly in the cultivation of native crops and fishing, they rarely move from their homes except to pick cloves. The name Swahili also includes the descendants of the early settlers in Pemba who are known as Wapemba. These people engage chiefly in agriculture but raise a smaller variety of native crops than the Wahadimu. Many of them own clove and coconut plantations. They live in less seclusion than the natives on the larger island. Another tribe included in the term are the Watumbatu whose chief stronghold is Tumbatu Island. They are a very exclusive people but by no means shy. They go down to the sea and man most of the craft plying in Zanzibar waters.

There is in addition a considerable influx of various tribes from the mainland, of whom the Wanyamwezi are economically the most important, being now the chief source of supply for the weeding of plantations.

In the 1931 Census the total population of the Protectorate was returned as 235,428. The non-native population numbers 49,000 of whom 33,400 are Arabs. The Khojas, Bohorahs, Hindoos, Parsees, and Goans possess most of the trade, either as merchants, shopkeepers, money-lenders, small traders, or skilled mechanics.

History and Constitution.

The beginnings of Zanzibar history are lost in antiquity. It appears more than probable that the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba were known
to the ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Assyrians, and Jews, but though the expedition of Necho (C. 600 B.C.) doubtless passed the Islands it is not till the first century that the Periplus gives a description of one of them under the name of Menuthias. The Hindus appear to have settled at a very early date and traces of Greek colonisation are not lacking. From about the 7th Century B.C. the Islands appear to have had a close connection with the South Arabian States. Bantu settlers probably made their appearance during the first five centuries A.D., and thereafter for the next five hundred years or so came also traders from China and Malaya in addition to those from the Persian Gulf. The Coast was probably converted to Islam early in the 10th Century. The Zeni Empire was founded by Ali bin Hassan, a prince of Shiraz, about 975 A.D., but it soon broke up into separate states and, by the time the Portuguese began the conquest of the East African littoral, was already declining. It was during the sixteenth century that the Arabs of the East Coast sought the assistance of the Imams of Muscat to drive out the Portuguese, and the capture of Mombasa Fort in 1598 may be said to mark the downfall of Portuguese power north of Mozambique. On the ruins of the Portuguese power in the seventeenth century arose that of the Imams of Muscat. The allegiance to Muscat, however, was of a more or less nominal character until Seyyid Said, after having subdued his enemies on the mainland, transferred his capital to Zanzibar in 1832. On his death in 1856 a dispute as to the succession arising between his sons Seyyid Thwain of Muscat and Seyyid Majid of Zanzibar the African possessions were made independent and confirmed under Majid by an arbitration (dated 1861) of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India.

Seyyid Said laid the foundations of Zanzibar's importance by transferring his capital from Muscat and making the island his permanent residence in the year 1832. Under his direction Zanzibar soon became both politically and commercially the principal native city in East Africa. "If you play on the flute at Zanzibar," says an Arab proverb of the period, "everybody as far as the lakes dances." Said's son Majid was succeeded in 1870 by Barghash, the first of his race to be commonly known as Sultan of Zanzibar.

In the year 1890 the supremacy of British interests in the islands themselves was recognized by France and Germany, and they were declared a British Protectorate in accordance with conventions by which Great Britain waived all claims to Madagascar in favour of France and ceded Heligoland to Germany. In the same year the mainland possessions which extended over the coast of East Africa, from Warsheikh in 3° N. latitude to Tunghi Bay in 10°42' S. latitude were ceded to Italy, Great Britain, and Germany respectively, Great Britain and Italy paying rent for the territories under their protection, while Germany acquired the Sultan's rights by the payment of a sum of 200,000/. At a later date Italy also acquired these rights by payment of a sum of 144,000/.

In 1891 a regular government was constituted with a British representative as first minister. On the death of the Sultan in 1896 the palace was seized by a member of his family, Seyyid Khaled, and to compel the latter's submission the palace was bombarded by British warships. In 1906, the British Government assumed more direct control over the Protectorate and reorganized the Government. In 1911 Seyyid Ali abdicated the throne and was succeeded by the present ruler, Seyyid Khalifa bin Harub. On 1st July, 1913, the control of the Protectorate was transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change of administration in the following year.

The Government was vested in a High Commissioner, who was also Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate, and a British Resident. The High Commissionership was abolished in 1926.

A Protectorate Council, with His Highness as President, was established at the same time. It was of an advisory and consultative nature and ceased to exist in 1926 when Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted.

Industries and Trade.

Zanzibar is now the dominant partner in the clove industry, holding as it does about 80 per cent of the shares. The other partners are Madagascar, Penang, and the Dutch East Indies.

Authorities differ as to the date when and country from which the clove tree was first introduced into Zanzibar. Some say that it was brought from Réunion by an Arab at the end of the 18th century. Colonel Rigby, Her Majesty's Consul and British Agent, in his report on the Zanzibar dominions written in the year 1860, states "the first clove trees were introduced about 30 years ago from Mauritius; being found to thrive they were extensively planted and they have now become the most valuable production of these Islands."

To Seyyid Said belongs the credit of establishing and promoting the clove industry. Burton records that he threatened confiscation to those who did not plant three clove trees for every coconut and that the country was almost denuded of the latter to make room for cloves. In 1839-40 the output amounted to about 9,000 fraslias. (The Frasila, equivalent to 35 lbs., is the local measure of weight for cloves). In 1849 it had risen to fraslias 120,000. In 1859 fraslias 139,000, valued at 55,666l. were exported, and the average output during the next decade was fraslias 200,000, valued at about 85,000l. Owing to the increase in production the price had, however, fallen from $5-$6 to $1-$2.

In 1872, a hurricane of great violence swept over the Island of Zanzibar and destroyed two-thirds of the clove and coconut trees. Pemba, though touched by the hurricane, sustained little damage. The years following this disaster were years of short supply, high prices, and intensive cultivation. The Pemba owners, actuated by motives of gain, hastened to cut down coconut trees on a wholesale scale throughout the island and to plant clove trees in their place. The Zanzibar owners, though temporarily ruined, set to work with commendable fortitude to replace the trees which the hurricane had destroyed, and ten years after the hurricane the normal output of cloves had not only been restored but increased.

Another event of great economic importance to the industry was the abolition of slavery. The
The quantity of asphalt produced during 1937 was 146,904 tons as against 111,965 tons in 1936.

The quantity of Asphalt exported during 1937 was 90,872 tons to the value of $1,194,914, as compared with 70,543 tons exported in 1936 of a value of $959,759.

Petroleum.—At the close of 1937 there were 18 Companies actively engaged in the exploitation of oil in the Colony. These Companies, having a total share capital of approximately $40,800,000, held over 417,483 acres of Crown Lands under licences and leases, of which approximately 176,753 acres were held under mining lease. In addition, appreciable areas of private lands are held. Up to 30th January, 1902, oil rights were not reserved by the Government when disposing of Crown Land, but after that year all Crown grants reserved the oil rights to the Crown. There are, consequently, three categories of oil lands, viz., lands disposed of prior to 1902 in which the oil rights rest in the surface owner; land sold since that date in which the oil rights are reserved to the Crown, and lands where both the surface and the underlying oil remain the property of the Crown.

In addition to the above, the Marine areas applied for within territorial waters cover, 389,500 acres.

The principal oil producing companies are the Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Fyzabad, Barrackpore, etc.; the United British Oilfields of Trinidad, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Point Fortin, Parry Lands, etc.; the Trinidad Lake Petroleum Company, Limited, from their own lands at Brighton; the Apex (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited, from Crown and private lands at Fyzabad, Siparia; the Trinidad Central Oilfields, Limited, from Crown Lands at Tabaqueite and Guapo; the Kern (Trinidad) Oilfields, Limited from Crown and private lands at Guapo; the Trinidad Oilfields Operating Co., Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Palo Seco, Fyzabad and San Francique; the Trinidad Petroleum Development Co., Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Palo Seco; New Dome Oilfields from private lands at Fyzabad; the Siparia Trinidad Oilfields, Ltd. from Crown lands at Palo Seco; the Trinidad Investments Ltd., from Crown and private lands at Oropouche, The Palo Seco Oilfields (C.C. Stollmeyer) from Crown lands at Palo Seco; The Petroleum Options (1925) Ltd. from private lands at San Francique; Coldan Co., Ltd., from private lands at Fyzabad; Antilles Petroleum Co. (Tdad) Ltd. private lands at Brighton; Mitchell, F. W., private lands at Point Fortin; Scottish Trinidad Oilfields, private lands at Rio Claro; and the Trinidad Consolidated oilfields, Crown oil rights under lease and private lands at Fyzabad. There are refineries at Pointe-à-Pierre, Point Fortin, Brighton, Tabaqueite, La Brea and San Francique, and all grades of petroleum products from petrol to road oil are produced. The total quantity of oil produced during 1937 was 15,602,989 barrels, an increase of 2,265,959 barrels as compared with the production for 1936. Of this total 9,743,292 barrels were from Crown Lands or lands in which the oil rights belonged to the Crown. The royalty paid by operating companies on oil, won from Crown rights during the year 1937, amounted to $720,837, as against $617,885 in 1936 and wayleaves to $1,760 as against $1,878 in 1936. The quantity of crude oil and products exported amounted to 14,124,056 barrels valued at $18,896,422 as against 12,405,222 barrels valued at $15,910,638 in 1936.

Grass Fruit.—Large areas have been planted, and the area under cultivation amounted in 1937 to 2,900 acres. The exports during the year 1937 amounted to 4,063,033 fruit, valued at $187,576.

Lime Fruit.—The value of the lime and lime products exported during the year 1937 amounted to $230,873 as compared with $91,834 in the previous year.

Of the total area of the Colony, including Tobago, 1,267,236 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of December, 1937, was estimated to be approximately 708,941 acres. About 377,050 acres are under cultivation.

The chief imports are textiles, flour and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery and lumber. 36.52 per cent. of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom.

Under the Customs Tariff, goods of Empire origin are admitted at a preferential rate of duty, the principal items being entitled to a preference of 50 per cent. of the general rate of duty. Approximately one half the list of items on the tariff are chargeable with duty ad valorem, the remainder, including all high duty goods, being subject to specific duties.

The following tables show the direction of the import and export trade of the Colony for 1937:

Municipalities.

In 1914 Port of Spain was constituted a municipal city. The corporate body created under provisions of the Port of Spain Board Ordinance, 1907, and known as the Port of Spain Town Board, was dissolved.
The next town and port is San Fernando, about 30 miles south from Port of Spain. The population at the census of 1931 was 14,287.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population at 1931 census, 5,072). The total municipal revenue of the two boroughs, and town of Port of Spain for the year ended 31st December, 1937, was $1,073,647 the expenditure $1,097,003, and the debt was $1,524,134 on the 31st December, 1937. This includes the loan for the purchase of the Woodbrook Estate, which has become an important suburb of Port of Spain.

Means of Communication.

The Government coastal steamers maintain three direct trips per week between Port of Spain (Trinidad) and Scarborough (Tobago). A weekly call is made at Roxborough (Tobago) and the following Tobago ports—King's Bay, Speyside, Man-o'-War Bay, Bloody Bay, Parlatusier, Castara, Pembroke, Plymouth, Mount Levine, Milford and Hillsboro in Tobago are served when inducement offers.

The railway system consists of the following:

The Port of Spain—Arima—Sangre Grande line (opened in 1897) 29 miles along the southern foot hills of the northern range of hills to within 8 miles of the eastern coast.

The San Fernando—Siparia line, 44 miles (leaving the former line at St. Joseph) following roughly the western coast line of the Colony (opened to Couva in 1880, San Fernando in 1882, Siparia in 1913); total distance, Port of Spain to Siparia, 51 miles.

The Caparo valley and Caparo valley extension lines, 28½ miles (opened to Tabaquite in 1898, Rio Claro in 1914), leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Jerningham Junction (14½ miles from Port of Spain) and running in a generally south-eastern direction; total distance from Port of Spain 43 miles.

The Guaracara line (10 miles) opened in 1884, leaving the Port of Spain—San Fernando—Siparia line at Marabella Junction (33 miles from Port of Spain) and running in an easterly direction to Princes Town; total distance from Port of Spain 42 miles, and

The total length of this system is 118 miles.

The railways afford opportunities of communication for passengers between all lines three times a day, and there are goods train opportunities once a day.

A suburban service of trains is run between Port of Spain and Arima (16 miles) at low fares, giving a service of 6 trains daily each way.

Road transport feeder services between the principal terminal stations and the coast provide for through transport between all the Districts of the Colony.

The railway stations are in telegraphic or telephonic communication one with the other on all parts of the system, giving a total length of about 118 miles of telegraph and about 14 miles of telephone lines. There is also a service telephone along the Cipero Section between San Fernando and Princes Town.

The total receipts from the railways, telegraph and telephones for the year 1937 amounted to $856,938, and the working expenses to $747,759, exclusive of provision for loan and capital interest and sinking fund amounting to $271,861. There was, therefore, a net surplus on working of $109,179, as compared with a surplus of $13,992 in the previous year.

The total number of passengers carried during 1937 was 1,737,006. The total tonnage of goods was 581,000 tons.

The roads are divided into main and local roads. The former and 58-38 per cent. of the latter are under the control of the Public Works Department. The other local roads amounting to 534 miles are under Local Road Boards. The main roads, with a total mileage of 1,061 miles, are made up of 459 miles metalled or gravelled and oiled, 266 miles metalled, 181 miles gravelled, 26 miles pitched and 149 miles natural soil roads. The local roads in Districts where there are no Local Road Boards comprise 764 miles and are made up of 42 miles metalled or gravelled and oiled, 106 miles metalled, 283 miles gravelled, 43 miles pitched and 290 miles natural soil roads. In addition there are many miles of Crown Traces in charge of the Wardens.

There are several garages in Port-of-Spain where motor cars can be engaged to convey passengers to any part of the Colony. At most of the railway stations motor cars can be hired to carry passengers to outlying parts. Motor omnibuses also ply on the main roads, and in some of the suburbs of Port-of-Spain.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain branch offices at San Fernando and Tobago, and 120 out-offices throughout the Colony.

The rates of postage are as follows, per 1 oz. letter:

Within Colony ... ... ... 1d.
To U.K., India and British Colonies, for 1st oz. ... ... ... 1½d.
and for each additional oz. or fraction of oz. ... ... ... 1d.
To other places, for 1st oz. ... ... ... 3d.
and for each additional oz. ... ... ... 1½d.

Communication by cable with the United Kingdom, Europe, North America and other parts of the world is maintained by the Pacific Cable Board (All Red Route) and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company. The Pacific Cable Board and the West India and Panama Telegraph Company are both now under the management of Cable & Wireless Ltd. of Electric House, London.

A wireless system is maintained between the following Islands—Barbados, Grenada, Carriacou, St. Lucia, Antigua, Montserrat and St. Kitts.

The principal tariffs are:

To the United Kingdom from Port-of-Spain ... ... ... 56c. per word
To Eastern Canada ... ... ... 36c. ,, ,
To Western Canada ... ... ... 41c. ,, ,

There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

Three wireless stations are maintained by the Trinidad Government at Port-of-Spain and North Post in Trinidad, and at Scarborough in Tobago. The North Post Station deals exclusively with ship, Tobago and Martinique traffic, while communication with British Guiana, Venezuela and Paramaribo is carried out by Port-of-Spain. Negotiations are proceeding between the Government and Cable and Wireless Limited with a view to the Company taking over the Government Wireless Stations.
Steamers calling at Trinidad comprise the following lines:—Aluminium Line, American Caribbean Line, American-South African Line, Bermuda and West Indies Line, Canadian National Steamships, Canadian Transport Company, Compania Anonima Venezolana de Navegacion Compagnie General Transatlantique, Fyffes Line, Hamburg Amerikanische Paketfahrt-Actiengesellschaft, Harrison Lines, Horn Line, Lamport and Holt, McCormick S. S. Co. (Pacific Argentine, Brazil Line Inc.), Munson Line, Nourse Line, Ocean Dominion New York Service, Ocean Dominion S.S. Corporation, Prince Line, Robin Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Co. (1), Colon Line (2), Surinam Line, Société Générale de Transports Maritime, Standard Oil Company of Venezuela, Wilhelmsen Line, and the Surinam Combined Navigation Company, and Weshfal-Larsen Line. Mail is regularly forwarded and received by some of these steamers.

In addition an increasing number of steamers call to load oil cargoes, or to take in coal or fuel oil for bunker purposes. During the winter months a number of tourist ships call.

Air Mail and Passenger Services are maintained by the Pan American Airways Inc. with the United States of America via St. Lucia, Antigua, St. Thomas, Porto Rico and Havana, with Buenos Aires via Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Para, Paramaribo and Georgetown, and with Venezuela touching at Caripito, La Guaira, and Maracaibo and onwards to Canal Zone, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombo, Cuba, Jamaica, Ecuador, British Honduras and the Republic of Honduras.

Currency and Banking.

British Currency and Trinidad Government notes are legal tender. Accounts are kept in dollars (1 dollar = 50 pence), and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and bronze, there being no limit to silver as legal tender.

In 1903 an Ordinance provided for the issue of Government Currency Notes was brought into force. Under this Ordinance notes of the denominations of $1, $2, and $1,000 have been issued, but the $1,000 notes were withdrawn and destroyed on the 21st December, 1934. The total value in circulation at 31st December, 1937, amounted to $945,720.

Government Savings Banks are established in 38 districts with a head office in Port-of-Spain. The total number of depositors at 31st December, 1937 was 53,060, with deposits amounting to $2,814,932.

The Commercial Banks are (1) Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., with a note circulation in the Colony estimated at $862,580; (2) the Royal Bank of Canada, with an authorized note circulation in the Colony of $1,500,000; (3) The Canadian Bank of Commerce, with an authorized note circulation of $750,000; (4) Messrs. Gordon, Grant & Company, Limited, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd., the Royal Bank of Canada, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce have Savings Bank branches and pay interest at the rate of 1½ per cent., while the Government Savings Bank pays 3 per cent. on amounts up to $2,400. The Bank of Messrs. Gordon Grant and Co., Limited, is not a bank of issue. In addition to the above Banks there is the Trinidad Co-operative Bank, an institution established in 1914, for the encouragement of thrift.

Education.

At the close of 1937 there were 293 primary and intermediate schools in the Colony, 45 being Government and 248 assisted schools. There were 258 schools in Trinidad and 35 in Tobago.

The number of pupils on the roll in December, 1937 was 72,766. The average daily attendance was 50,799, or 69.8 per cent. of the number on roll. As compared with the previous year there was an increase of 2,567 on the roll, and an increase of 2 per cent. in average attendance. The number of teachers and pupil teachers employed was 1,888 (1,904 in 1936).

The total expenditure on education during the year 1937, deducting the amount received in school and examination fees, was $878,499 as compared with $870,325 in 1936.

Secondary Education.

The following Colleges afford facilities for the higher education of boys:—The Queen's Royal College and its affiliated institutions, the St. Mary's College in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima College in San Fernando, the Bishop's High School in Tobago. The St. Joseph's Convent and the St. Hilary's High School in Port-of-Spain, and the Naparima Girls' High School at San Fernando, which are also affiliated to the Queen's Royal College, provide similar education for girls.

The affiliated institutions work under the same curriculum as the Queen's Royal College, and receive a Government grant-in-aid.

A Government Training College for Teachers at Port-of-Spain was attended by about 133 students in 1937.

Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools.

Opportunities for technical education are afforded by a Board of Industrial Training established in 1906, which also supervises a small institution for the instruction of the blind.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. It was visited in 1596 by Capt. Keymis in the Darling and found to be uninhabited. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampais procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the Island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1667 they themselves were compelled by the French Admiral Estras, to evacuate the island the Dutch Admiral Binks being defeated.
in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1748, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781 Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defense by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Situation and Area.

Tobago lies between 11° 8' and 11° 21' N. lat. and 60° 30' and 60° 50' W. long., distant from Barbados 120 miles, from Grenada 75 miles, and from Trinidad, 26 miles. It is 26 miles long and 14 miles at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 116 square miles, or 74,382 acres, of which about 42,000 acres are under cultivation.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

The population of Tobago in 1931 was 25,358 according to census.

General Description.—Tobago.

Tobago is a Ward of Trinidad and its exports out of the Colony all pass through Trinidad and are included in the general statistics of the Colony. It has also a considerable trade in minor products, vegetables, live stock, etc., with Trinidad. The total value of the Tobago trade in 1937 was $338,333, made up as follows:

| Product       | Value   |
|---------------|---------|
| Cacao         | $176,740|
| Coconuts      | $7,743  |
| Copra         | $190,275|
| Other Products| $163,575|

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1931, of 833. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Fort King George, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of about 425 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a coastal steamer service, provided by the Government.

The island possesses a fair mileage of motor roads.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Methodist bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and one unofficial member of Council represented Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created.
