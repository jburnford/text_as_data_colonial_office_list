WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the territories administered by His Majesty's Governments in the Commonwealth of Australia and in New Zealand or the Colony of Fiji, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioner, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.

The Colony, which includes Ocean, Christmas, Fanning, and Washington Islands, besides the Gilbert, Ellice and Phoenix Groups, is under the charge of a Resident Commissioner, who is responsible to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific who resides in Fiji.

The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:—Makin, Butaritari, Marakei and Abaiang (Northern Gilberts); Tarawa, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Aranuka (Central Gilberts), Nonouti, Tabiteua, Bern, Nikunau, Onotu, Tamana, Arorae (Southern Gilberts).

The Ellice Islands are the following nine:—Nanumea, Nanumaga, Niutao, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Nurakita.

The Phoenix Islands were annexed to the Colony in March, 1937. They consist of Birnie, Canton, Enderbury, Gardner, Hull, McKean, Phoenix and Sydney Islands.

The three groups above form a rough triangle, the approximate geographical positions of whose vertices are:—North (Gilbert Is.) 30°N., 173°E.; East (Phoenix Is.) 4°S., 171°W.; South (Ellice Is.) 11°S., 179°E.

The population of the Colony as determined at the 1931 Census was:—Ocean Island, 2,309; Gilbert Islands, 26,528; Ellice Islands, 4,074; Fanning, Washington and Christmas Islands, 505. The total of 33,416 comprised 275 Europeans, 32,467 natives, 235 half-castes and 439 Asiatics. An annual count is made of the population, but the figures obtained are not sufficiently accurate to be of value for comparative purposes.

With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate.

A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups.

OCEAN ISLAND (or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. Reaching a height of 280 ft. and covered with vegetation, it is the only island of the Colony not of stoll formation. The population of Ocean Island on the 31st December, 1937, was 2,878. This total included 134 Europeans, 793 Chinese, 852 Banabans, and 1,951 Gilbert and Ellice Islanders (the majority of the latter being employed in the phosphate industry).

FANNING AND WASHINGTON ISLANDS lie about 30° 51' N. latitude, and 169° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. An Acting Administrative Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 28. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the Colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel chartered by Fanning Island Plantations Ltd. The population of Fanning Island at the 31st December, 1937, was 193, that at Washington Island at the same time being 122.

CHRISTMAS ISLAND (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell, and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. All vessels employed or chartered by the Company trading between the Society Islands and Christmas Island have been exempted from the Quarantine Ordinance, and may visit Christmas Island without a preliminary call at a prescribed port of entry in the Colony. Periodical visits are made by H.M.'s ships. The population on the 31st December, 1937, numbered 47.
PHOENIX GROUP.

The Phoenix group comprises Phoenix, Birnie, Hull, Canton, Gardner, McKean, Enderbury and Sydney Islands, and is situated to the east of the Gilbert and Ellice groups. The islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to Messrs. Burns, Philp (South Sea) Company, Limited, for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914. By an Order in Council dated 18th March, 1937, the boundaries of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony were extended to include the Phoenix Group.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work is undertaken and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. All the inhabited islands have native hospitals under the charge of native students trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Communication between the various islands was formerly infrequent, depending on the irregular movements of vessels belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, Limited, on Chong and Company Limited, and the British Phosphate Commissioners, but the acquisition by the Administration of the auxiliary sailing vessel "Nimonoa" has considerably increased the facilities for regular communication.

The principal sources of revenue are import duties (general ad valorem rate 25 per cent., British preferential ad valorem rate 12½ per cent.); export duty on copra; land tax (paid in copra) on native communities; capitulation tax 10s. a head p.a. on non-natives; ship, trading and other licences; royalty on phosphate shipped from Ocean Island; interest on invested funds and consolidated payment by the British Phosphate Commissioners. By virtue of the latter the Commissioners are exempted from certain taxation and duties.

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is situated between the parallels of 5° South and 12° 30' South, and the meridians of 155° and 170° of East longitude.

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands, extending at its extremities from Bougainville Straits to Mitre Island, in the Santa Cruz Group, for a distance of 900 miles, and north and south from the Ontong Java Group to Rennell Island for a distance of 430 miles, in an area approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,000 square miles are land.

The native population (mainly Melanesian) is 93,415.

The Solomon Islands were first discovered in the year 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. The island first sighted they named Isabel because it was on that Saint's day that they left Callao. In the year 1595 a second expedition under Mendana sailed from Peru, but failed to locate the island of Guadalcanal, whereon it was intended he should form a settlement, and he arrived in the Santa Cruz Group, and landed at Graciosa Bay. The new colony proved a failure, the death of Mendana put an end to any prospect of success, and the remnants of the original party returned to Peru.

In 1787 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz Group and the north-west coast line of the island of Malaita.

In the same year de Bougainville in the frigate La Boudoue, sailed from Monte Video on a deliberate quest of the Terra Australis which he missed, and arrived at New Guinea; in sailing back he passed through the Straits which are the present north-eastern boundary of the Protectorate, the island on the right being named Bougainville after him, and the one on the left named after Choiseul, who was at the time Minister of France.

Twenty years later, and 700 miles to the southeast, la Perouse, in command of the French frigates L'Astrolabe and La Boussole, on a voyage of discovery, was wrecked at Piou on the island of Vanikoro. His fate was unknown for 40 years.

From this time, many Europeans visited the Group, and British ships-of-war paid periodical visits. In 1860 natives were recruited to work on plantations in Queensland and Fiji. The recruiting for Queensland ceased in 1903 and most of the natives were repatriated.

Recruiting for Fiji continued until 1910.

Between the years 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the Proclamation in 1893 of the British Protectorate over the Southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristoval, the New Georgia Group and its Dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50.

In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz Group, including Utupua, Tucopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona, were added to the Protectorate, and in 1900 the Northern Islands, namely, Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Bougainville Straits, south and south-east of the main island of Bougainville, and the atoll group of Ontong Java, were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

The population of the Protectorate in 1937 was:

| Europeans | Native (Melanesian) | Native (Polynesian) | Chinese | Japanese | Malays |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|----------|-------|
|           |                     |                     |        |          |       |
| 478       | 89,568              | 3,847               | 192    | 8        | 1     |
| Total     |                     |                     |        |          |       |

The climate of the Solomon Islands, owing to the prevalence of malaria, is not healthy, but the conditions of living have been greatly improved during recent years and the possibilities of good health during temporary residence have been enormously increased.

Generally speaking, the seasons are well defined by the trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the lowest minimum temperature is recorded, and the highest mean and maximum temperatures are, as a rule, recorded in the months from November to April which is commonly known as the north-west season.

The rainfall varies considerably from month to month and year to year, though the average rainfall, recorded at Tulagi, is approximately 120 inches a year.

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner (stationed in Tulagi) acting under the authority and control of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific (who resides in Suva, Fiji).

There is no Legislative Council. Laws are made by the High Commissioner—in the form of King's Regulations—under powers conferred by the Pacific Order in Council, 1893.

There is an Advisory Council, consisting of the Resident Commissioner and not more than seven members, three of whom may be officials.

The Protectorate is divided up into eight administrative areas, each under a District Officer. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

The Customs Tariff consists of duties at specific or ad valorem rates on certain imports and exports and includes provisions for Empire preferences.
