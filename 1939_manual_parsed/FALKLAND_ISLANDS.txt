FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N.E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of East Falkland Island and West Falkland Island, which, with the adjacent islands, have an estimated area of 2,580 square miles and 2,038 square miles respectively.

There are two groups of dependencies (i) South Georgia with South Orkney and South Sandwich, the boundaries being the 50th parallel of south latitude and the 20th and 50th meridians of west longitude (ii) South Shetland and Graham Land bounded by the parallel of latitude 58° S., and the meridians of longitude 50° and 80° W.

The island of South Georgia lies about 800 miles to the east of the Falkland Islands, South Orkney and South Sandwich being about 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia. The northern point of South Shetland is about 500 miles to the south of the Falklands.

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1584. In 1764 Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis in East Falkland. The French settlement was taken over by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1766.

In the following year Captain Byron took possession of West Falkland, and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770; this action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the British garrison in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774 and no further formal occupation was made until 1820, when the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement in the East Falkland which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government. Until 1842, they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making Admiralty surveys. In 1842, a Civil Administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis until the following year when they were removed to Stanley, then known as Port William.

The colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 until 1880 and for a mail service until 1884-5, since which year the colony has been self-supporting.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain James Cook, who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain William Smith in 1819, and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821.

The dependencies were visited only by exploring expeditions, sealers, and whalers until the rise of the modern whaling industry in those regions.

General Description.

(a) Falkland Islands.

The Falkland Islands have a very deeply indented coast line and many good natural harbours. The surface is hilly, attaining its maximum elevation of 2,315 feet in Mount Adam, West Falkland.

The entire country is covered with wild moorland interrupted by outcrops of rock and the peculiar collections of angular boulders named "stone runs."

There is no cultivation except in the immediate vicinity of the settlements and shepherds' houses where vegetables and in a few places hay is grown. The soil is chiefly peat but considerable areas of sand also occur.

Communication is maintained by sea and horses, but there are no roads beyond the immediate vicinity of Stanley, the traveller being guided by natural landmarks. A commencement has been recently made to indicate recognized tracks with direction posts. Trees are completely absent.

The only town is Stanley in East Falkland, with a population of about 1,200. The houses are mostly iron and wood, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house but there are several boarding houses affording fair accommodation. Stanley is a port of register and had, on the 31st December, 1937, 26 vessels aggregating 32,689 tons.

The cost of mutton is 3d. per lb., of beef 4d., fowls' eggs when procurable cost 2½d. to 3d. each, while penguin eggs in spring are sold at a price varying from 4s. to 8s. 6d. per hundred. Milk is priced at 1s. per quart. Most foodstuffs have to be imported.

Climate and Health.

In the Falklands the temperature is uniformly low, ranging from 40° to 65° in summer and from 30° to 50° in winter, with an annual mean of 42°.

The annual rainfall seldom exceeds 25 inches, and although snow falls frequently it does not as a rule lie long. In summer the atmosphere is very dry and evaporation rapid.
The Climate is very healthy though somewhat trying to people from the United Kingdom owing to the constant high winds in summer. Weather conditions are definitely more pleasant in winter than they are in the greater part of England. The conditions of living generally are of a reasonably good standard though limited resources and horizons render the country unsuitable for persons of a neurotic or asthmatic tendency. An adequate variety of diet is obtainable and the quality of the food is very fair. Good vegetables can be grown and fruit is procured from Monte Video. The birth rate in 1937 was 15·48 and the death rate 8·36 per 1,000 respectively.

(b) Dependencies.

The island of South Georgia is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, while the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea. There is a coastal fringe free from snow in summer and more or less clothed with vegetation, including tussock grass. Land whaling stations have been established in five of the numerous bays.

The remaining dependencies are even more inhospitable, being nearly completely covered with snow and ice and almost entirely destitute of plant life. All the dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

A Land Station is equipped at Deception Island, in the South Shetland group, and another in the South Orkneys, but neither has operated within recent years.

Industries, Trade and Customs.

The inhabitants of the Falkland Islands are almost entirely occupied in sheep farming, the whole acreage of the colony being divided into large sheep runs. Wool is the principal product but tallow and hides are also exported. There were in 1937, 604,346 sheep, 10,076 cattle and 3,387 horses in the islands.

Seal oil is also produced for export by a company formed in 1928.

The whaling field of the dependencies, in which whaling by modern methods was first carried on in 1904, has become more productive than all those in the rest of the world combined; a small quantity of seal oil is also produced.

Dependencies exports during 1937 amounted to 406,646L., 39 per cent. of which was consigned to U.K., 58 per cent. to Europe via Cape Verde Is. and Canary Is. Remainder to Argentine.

An expedition for research, mainly into whaling, for which the ships "Discovery II" and "William Scoresby" have been acquired, has been operating in the southern seas.

In the case of the Colony proper, exports amounted to 204,020L., 92 per cent. to U.K., remainder to British Honduras, Chile, and Uruguay; in the case of the Dependencies 39 per cent. of total exports were shipped to the United Kingdom and 61 per cent. to other countries.

In the case of the Colony proper, 73 per cent. of the imports came from the United Kingdom, 3·6 per cent. from Argentine, 1·58 per cent. from Brazil, 8·4 per cent. from Chile, 8·3 per cent. from Uruguay, and 5·1 per cent. elsewhere; in the case of the Dependencies 10·1 per cent. came from the United Kingdom, 5·2 per cent. from Norway, 28 per cent. from Dutch West Indies, 1·6 per cent. from Holland, 2·8 per cent. from Cape Verde Is. and 3 per cent. from elsewhere. Remaining 49·3 per cent. represents oil brought to South Georgia for storage.

The Customs duties are all specific and are levied on spirits, wines, beer, tobacco and matches (import) and on wool, whale oil, seal oil and guano (export). They are non-preferential except that matches of British manufacture are admitted free, and that the import duty on tobacco and cigarettes produced and manufactured in any part of the British Empire is at nine-tenths of the ordinary rate.

Education.

There are two schools in Stanley. A Government school is maintained from public funds, which, whilst being elementary in character, makes provision for attendance at a Continuation Class for a two years' course of further education. There is also a Convent School managed by Roman Catholic Sisters; this school, however, is not subject to Government control, and receives no subsidy.

The Government contributes two-thirds of the cost of the board and lodging of children from the country districts attending school in Stanley.

Four travelling teachers are provided by the Government and two by the Falkland Islands Company. These teachers travel from Settlement to Settlement devoting a certain amount of time to each. The number of children receiving education in the Colony in 1937 was 387.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling and local 5L., 1L., and 10s. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1888, a Government Savings Bank was established, in which, on 30th September, 1937, the deposits were 185,418L., belonging to 1,069 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company, Limited.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This, however, was not found profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, in shipping, and in the importation of goods.

The company maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and contributes to the provision of a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Stanley and the outside world is effected principally through Montevideo, to which port a service is maintained in accordance with actual requirements by the s.s. "Lafonia," a vessel of some 1,800 tons dead weight belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited, and running on a mail contract for a period of five years from January, 1937. The Falkland Islands Company, Limited, also maintains the s.s. "Fitzroy," of some 600 tons dead weight. This vessel normally makes 12 to 15 voyages a year to Patagonia.

The distance from Stanley to Montevideo is rather more than 1,000 miles and the time taken on the voyage by the s.s. "Lafonia" averages four days. The average time occupied in the transit of mails to and from the United Kingdom, via Montevideo, is 26 days. Opportunities for the receipt and despatch of mails are available every four weeks.
Communication with South Georgia is maintained by the Falkland Islands Company's s.s. "Lafonia," which makes two voyages between Stanley and the Dependency during the year. The time occupied on the voyage in either direction averages three days.

The inter-isular service for mails and passengers is maintained by coasting steamers belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited.

Two wireless stations for external traffic are maintained by the Government, one at Stanley and one at Cumberland Bay, Grytviken, in the Dependency of South Georgia. A smaller station at Fox Bay on the West Falkland is maintained also by the Government for inter-isular communication. Telegraphic charges are 1s. 3d. per word, ordinary messages to U.K. direct; 7½d. per word Government and deferred messages. The principal farm stations on East Falkland Island are connected by telephone with the Stanley exchange and those on West Falkland Island with the Government headquarters at Fox Bay.

Constitution.
The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council composed of five official members and 2 unofficial members, and a Legislative Council composed of four official and four unofficial members. The unofficial members of the Legislative Council are appointed by Warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for a term not exceeding five years.
