**MALAYA: STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.**

Malaya comprises the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States of Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, and the Unfederated States of Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Perlis. Malaya is also regarded as including the State of Brunei, in the island of Borneo, of which the Governor of the Straits Settlements is High Commissioner and which, like the Malay States in the Peninsula, is in treaty relationship with Great Britain.

The Straits Settlements comprise Singapore, Penang, Malacca, and Labuan. The first three were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115). Labuan, a separate Colony since 1846, was incorporated with the Straits Settlements as part of the Settlement of Singapore in 1907, and became a separate Settlement in 1912.

**Situation and Area.**

Singapore is an island about 26 miles long by 14 miles wide, containing an area of 220 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, to which it is joined by a causeway across the Straits of Johore, which are about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which are included in the Settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the city of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang comprises the island of Penang and Province Wellesley. Penang island is about 15 miles long and 11 broad, containing an area of 110 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait about 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the Settlement, about 11 miles in width, and extending 31 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian river (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 290 square miles.
The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long., on Penang island.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 miles from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 43 miles in length, and 27 miles in breadth, containing an area of 640 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated in the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 60' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers (1931), 1,142.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1883, and placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated in the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 60 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 11 miles, and its greatest breadth about 11 miles. The inhabitants, who number (1937) 1,313, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employees of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance. An account of Labuan will be found later.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,357 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907, and in 1912 the island became a separate Settlement.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time. A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements. An account of Brunei will be found later.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17 March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became a place of reduced commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but as soon as Singapore was established Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. Although at first unimportant Penang's trade has now assumed large proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula. The trade of Malacca as an entrepôt port for central Malaya has recently revived.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of $6,000 (Straits) should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to $10,000 (Straits). This acquisition has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 290 square miles. This province is in an advanced state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1808 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded to the British by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole formed, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang. By an agreement dated, at Singapore, the 6th June, 1934, the Dindings were retroceded to Perak in February, 1935.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end about 1365, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819 by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bencoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.
Constitution, Law and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council consists of 6 official members, excluding the Governor who presides, such other official members as the Governor may nominate, at present 2 in number, and 3 unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of 13 official members and 13 unofficial members, of whom 2 are elected by the Chamber of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local Ordinances and in such English Acts and Orders in Council as are applicable to the Colony. The Penal Code closely follows the Indian Penal Code. Criminal Procedure is regulated by the Criminal Procedure Code which is based on the Indian Code. Civil Procedure is regulated by Rules of Court made under powers conferred by the Courts Ordinance and based on the English Rules of the Supreme Court.

There is a Supreme Court which is a court of record and consists of (a) the High Court which exercises original criminal and civil jurisdiction and appellate criminal and civil jurisdiction in appeals from subordinate courts; (b) the Court of Appeal which exercises appellate civil jurisdiction. Assizes are held at Singapore and Penang every two months, and once a quarter at Malacca. The Supreme Court is composed of a Chief Justice and three or more Puisne Judges. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court to the Privy Council.

There is also a Court of Criminal Appeal. The subordinate Courts are the District Courts, Police Courts, Marine Police Courts and Coroners' Courts.

Climate.

The characteristic features of the climate of the Straits Settlements are uniform temperature, high humidity, and copious rainfall. The variation of temperature throughout the year is very small and the excessively high temperatures found in continental-tropical areas are never experienced.

The mean temperature during 1937 was:

- Singapore (Kallang Aerodrome) .. 81·1°F.
- Penang (District Hospital) .. 82·1°F.
- Malacca (Bukit China) .. 79·9°F.

The Mean Monthly Maximum and Minimum Temperature varied as follows:

| Mean Monthly Maximum |
|-----------------------|
| Highest °F.          |
| Singapore .. 87·9 March |
| Penang .. 91·9 Feb.    |

| Lowest °F.           |
|----------------------|
| Singapore .. 85·3 Oct.|
| Penang .. 88·1 Oct.   |

Mean Monthly Minimum

| Lowest °F.          |
|--------------------|
| Singapore .. 74·2 Jan.|
| Penang .. 73·5 Jan.  |

Highest °F.

| Singapore .. 93 on 17th March |
| Penang .. 95 on 22nd Feb.     |

Lowest °F.

| Singapore .. 70 on 6th Jan. |
| Penang .. 65 on 6th Jan.    |

There are no well marked dry and wet seasons, rain falling throughout the year.

Records for 65 years at Singapore show that the average annual rainfall is 96 inches. December is the wettest month with a little over 10 inches, while February, May, June, July and September, the dry months, with between 6½ and 7 inches. Rain falls, on the average, on half the days in the year.

The wettest year recorded was 1913 with 135·92 inches and the driest 1888 with 63·21 inches.

Records of 51 years at Penang show an annual rainfall of 106 inches, October being the wettest month with about 17 inches, and February the driest with three inches, rain falling on the average on about 160 days in the year.

The force of the monsoons is not much felt though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz:—

S.W. from May to October.
N.E. from November to April.

but at the coastal stations, the diurnal land and sea breezes are often stronger than the prevailing monsoons.

The rainfall recorded was as follows:

| No. of Rainfall days in |
|-------------------------|
| 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1937 |
| Singapore | 72·76 | 85·6 | 89·19 | 192 |
| Penang | 107·98 | 96·2 | 93·68 | 174 |
| Malacca | 95·92 | 92·4 | 96·53 | 196 |

Province

| Wellesley | 91·02 | 94·2 | 98·20 | 134 |
| Labuan | 140·69 | 127·8 | 132·76 | 154 |

Although the days are hot, and, on account of the high humidity somewhat oppressive, the nights are almost always reasonably cool, and it rarely happens that refreshing sleep is not obtained. The effect of the heat and humidity, without seasonal change, is, however, cumulative; and after a few years a change to a bracing climate becomes imperative for Europeans if health is to be maintained.

Population.

The population of the Straits Settlements as estimated at mid-year 1938, from the formula, census 1931 + births - deaths + migrational surplus, was as follows:

| Population |
|------------|
| Singapore Island | 710,037 |
| Penang Island | 235,969 |
| Province Wellesley | 163,526 |
| Malacca | 223,991 |
| Labuan | 8,567 |
| Christmas Island | 1,313 |
| Cocos Island | 1,142 |

Total | 1,344,545 |

Commerce.

The foreign trade of the Colony of the Straits Settlements is not separately distinguished, having since 1922 been merged in that of the Malayan Registration area which includes the Colony, the Federated Malay States, and the Unfederated Malay States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu. This trade passes principally through the ports of Singapore and Penang in the Colony, and Port Swettenham in the F.M.S.

The principal agricultural products are rubber, coconuts, pineapples, palm oil, and rice. Tobacco is a crop of growing importance.

The principal imports comprise foodstuffs, petroleum products, tin ore, rubber, textiles and machinery. The chief domestic exports are rubber, smelted tin, copra, palm oil, tinned pineapples and areca-nuts with a few manufactured articles. There is an important transit trade in the ports of Singapore and Penang. The chief re-exports are mineral oils, rice, spices, textiles, and dried and salted fish.

The ports of the Straits Settlements are free ports and are subject to no import or export duties. There are excise duties on liquors, tobacco, and petroleum, and a tax on first registration of motor vehicles not manufactured in the British Empire.

The following show the total imports and exports for the six years up to 1937 and the values of some of the principal articles in 1937.

**Shipping.**

Singapore and George Town (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had on the 31st December, 1937, 838 steam, motor, and sailing vessels registered, of a total gross tonnage of 149,499 tons.

The ports of Singapore and Penang are administered under Chapter 150 (Merchant Shipping) by the Marine Department, and by Harbour Boards under Chapter 149 (Ports) in each Settlement (Singapore and Penang) for the management of the wharves.

Malacca is also a port at which ocean-steamers call. The number of merchant steamers of over 75 tons net register with cargo and in ballast, and the aggregate tonnage arriving at the ports in 1937 were:

| Port       | Nos. | Tons   |
|------------|------|--------|
| Singapore  | 6,781| 16,394,845|
| Penang     | 2,426| 6,640,041|
| Malacca    | 405  | 621,159 |

The following table shows the comparison between British tonnage and the total tonnage of merchant steamers of over 75 tons net register with cargo and in ballast, arrived and departed at the ports of the Straits Settlements, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Labuan, and Christmas Island, for each of the years from 1933 to 1937:

| Year | British Tonnage | Total Tonnage |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1933 | 18,275,759      | 43,011,782    |
| 1934 | 19,456,917      | 43,961,730    |
| 1935 | 19,243,237      | 44,959,859    |

| 1937 | 20,339,918      | 47,709,291    |

**Note.—** The definition of merchant steamers was altered, with effect from January, 1931, from vessels of 50 tons net register and over, to vessels of over 75 tons net register.

**Communications.**

(i) **Steamship Lines.**

Over 50 lines of sea-going steamers touch at Singapore. The following table shows the main lines of communication:

The Public Telegraph and Telephone Systems of the Straits Settlements are, apart from the telephone exchange systems on Singapore Island, provided, maintained and operated by the P. & T. Department. Excluding the Singapore Telephone System, these consisted on 31st December, 1937, of 498 miles of overhead lines, carrying 4,173 miles of wire, and 112 miles of underground and submarine cables with 10,158 miles of single wire. There were at that date 41 telegraph offices and 18 telephone exchanges with 2,996 telephones connected thereto.

Flat rates per word are charged throughout this system.

A Telephone Trunk network, provided and maintained by the P. & T. Department, interconnects Singapore, Penang and Malacca and all telephone exchanges in the Federated and Unfederated Malay States except a few of the more remote exchanges.

The Telephone Exchange System of Singapore is owned and operated by the Oriental Telephone and Electric Company Ltd., under licence from the Straits Settlements Government.

Sections connect the main line with ports on the West Coast. A line from Gemas in Negri Sembilan, through Pahang and Kelantan, connects with the Royal State Railways of Siam on the East Coast.

There are 912-06 miles of roads which were maintained in good order at a cost of $589,739-34 or $647-00 per mile. The figures for 1936 were $96-74 miles maintained at a cost of $503,277-73 or $561-23 per mile.

In addition to normal maintenance a sum of $278,041-81 was spent on improvements and reconstruction work. The corresponding figure for last year was $291,568-74.

Education.

The control of all Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements, and Adviser on Education, Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. The Government assists certain Chinese and Indian vernacular schools by a system of grants-in-aid. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided in Government or grant-in-aid schools, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are secular. Raffles College was opened in Singapore in 1929 for a higher education in English. There is a Reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1937 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls). | 24 | 9,475 | 9,150 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls). | 33 | 15,931 | 15,200 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 218 | 25,084 | 23,634 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls). | 116 | 18,612 | 17,606 |
| Total         | 391 | 69,102 | 65,892 |
Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1896, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar, and also the old Hong Kong dollar which was at that time legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed in England in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin was of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of £60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the starting value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council, dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced.

Local silver and nickel coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and copper coins are legal tender up to $1. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of denominations 25 cents and ten cents were issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver, but their issues have been discontinued. These notes were legal tender to the extent of $2.

By the Currency Ordinance passed in 1923 the various funds controlled by the Currency Commissioners were amalgamated into one fund styled the Currency Guarantee Fund.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony; the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; the P. & O. Banking Corporation; Eastern Bank Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the National City Bank of New York; the Banque de l'Indo-China; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; the Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, The Yokohama Specie Bank, Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, Bank of China, The United Chinese Bank, Limited, The Ban Hin Lee Bank, Limited, the China and Southern Bank, Lee Wah Bank, Thomas Cook & Son (Bankers) Limited and Kwong Lee Banking Company.

The first two banks abovementioned were, at one time, allowed to issue notes in the Colony, the former under its Charter, and the latter by law, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1937 was $135,105 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the end of 1937 was $104,975,821. These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank at each Settlement.

THE SETTLEMENT OF LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is about 35 square miles. It is distant from the coast at the nearest point about six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 130 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British Ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1889 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and, as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1905, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore. On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was constituted a separate Settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded, great hopes of the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success. In 1893, the Central Borneo Company was reconstructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited. The mines have been closed since the beginning of 1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 14 feet can go alongside Messrs. Harrisons & Crosfield's wharf.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton.

Labuan is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, para rubber, jelutong and copra, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and over 10,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office Savings Bank in Labuan. Harrisons and Crosfield (Borneo) Ltd. are the local Sub-Agents of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The currency is that of the Straits Settlements.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other natives from Brunei and the mainland of Borneo, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

There are five Government Schools, viz.:—The Government English School, Town Vernacular Schools for boys and girls, and the Vernacular Schools in Bukit Kallang and Kerupang. In addition there are four private schools, viz.:—St. Anne's School (Roman Catholic Mission), Mrs. Fell's Private School, Chung Hwa School, and Chi Wen School.

A reservoir owned by the Government supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking water.

The Cable and Wireless, Ltd., is a station on the island connected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong, and North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

The Brunei Government maintains a Wireless Station which communicates with the Stations erected in the neighbouring countries of Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo.

A weekly service of steamers plying between Singapore, North Borneo Ports, and the Philippines provides Labuan with regular communication with these places; there are, in addition, local coastal steamers.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues, land rents and licences.

The public revenue and expenditure for the last three years were respectively:

CHRISTMAS ISLAND.

Christmas Island, with an area of 60 square miles, lies in the Indian Ocean, latitude 10° 30' S. and longitude 105° 40' E., 223 miles S. 8° E. of Java Head, and 529 miles N. 79° E. from the Coco Islands. It is densely wooded and of irregular shape, about 11 miles long (at the longest point) and about 4½ miles wide (at the narrowest point). The climate is healthy with average maximum and minimum temperatures 87°F. and 71°F. There is a prevalent E.S.E. trade wind. The Island has been known to navigators since about the middle of the 17th century. It was formally annexed on the 6th June, 1888, placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements in 1889 and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore in 1900. The Island is administered by a District Officer of the Malayan Civil Service. There is a small force of Sikh Police drafted from the S.S. Police Force. All the inhabitants (mainly Chinese and Malays), with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, are employed by the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, Ltd., registered in London, which works the large natural deposits of phosphate of lime to which the Island owes its importance. In 1923 a wireless station was installed, and the Island is now in direct communication with Singapore. A school was established in 1931, and a teacher supplied by the Government. Population, 1937, 31st December, 1,313 (adult males 1,086, adult females 109, children 119). Expenditure, 1937, $29,405 (including salaries of D.O. and Sikh Police). Imports in 1937, chiefly iron and steel manufactures. Exports consisted solely of phosphates of lime. In 1937, 162,668 tons of phosphates of lime were exported. Japan was the principal buyer with 127,617 tons. The S.S. and F.M.S. bought 110,741 tons of phosphate dust. Shipping—83,393 tons entered in 1937, and 80,872 tons cleared. British ships totalled 34,827 tons while Japanese ships totalled 26,547 tons, Chinese ships 16,338 tons, Greek ships 3,336 tons and Norwegian ships 2,345 tons.

MALAYA:

FEDERATED MALAY STATES.

The Federated Malay States comprises four States: Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang.

Perak.

Perak is ruled by a dynasty that claims descent from the last Malay Sultan of Malacca. In the 17th century it was overrun by the Acehnese, and at some time after 1636 a Johore prince, the husband of a Perak princess, was sent to Aceh to rule it under the title of Sultan Mudzafar Shah. From 1650 onwards the Dutch endeavoured to get a monopoly of the tin exported from Perak, establishing near the mouth of the Perak river several factories, which the Malays, from time to time, cut off and destroyed. In 1765 the Sultan made a treaty with the Dutch.

British influence began early in the 19th century. A treaty with Penang in 1818 secured to British subjects the right to free trade in Perak. In 1825 a British arbitrator settled the boundary between Perak and Selangor. By the Burney Treaty with Siam, in 1826, the independence of Perak and Selangor was recognised, though the Sultan of Perak was permitted to send tribute to Siam if he so desired. In the same year the Sultan ceded to the British the Dindings and the Island of Pangkor as posts for the suppression of piracy, and agreed to rely solely on the protection of Great Britain. From 1872 to 1874 there was almost continuous fighting of more or less severity between rival factions of Chinese in the Larut district where valuable tin deposits had been found.

Having regard to the anarchy which prevailed, Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874, induced the Perak chiefs to sign the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874), and to accept thereby a Resident whose advice should be "asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and customs." The murder of the first British Resident (Mr. J. W. Biroch) in 1875 led to a military expedition and the banishment of the Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair. The country soon settled; and the Malay constitution was restored under a Sultan protected by the British Government. In 1936 the Dindings were retroceded to Perak.

Selangor.

In the 14th century, Klang, which is now a district of Selangor, is said to have been subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the next century it was given to a Penghulu of the family of the Bendaharas of old Malacca, and a son of Sultan Mansur Shah (1458-1477 A.D.) of Malacca was made ruler of Jeram, near Langat. During the period of Portuguese ascendancy, little is known of the Selangor coast. The Dutch opened factories for the purchase of tin at Kuala Selangor and at Knala Linggi. In 1718, Daeng Chelak, a Bugis chief, who had married a Johore princess, settled at Kuala Selangor, and about 1780 their descendant was recognised as Sultan Salehuddin by the Sultan of Perak. The throne has remained in the same family ever since. In 1783, the Dutch blockaded Kuala Selangor, and forced the Sultan to acknowledge the suzerainty of Holland.

In 1818, the Sultan of Selangor made a commercial treaty with the East India Company at Penang. In 1874 anarchy prevailed amongst the Malay chiefs of Selangor, and pirates ravaged the coastal trade. The Sultan's difficulties were such that he was glad to accept a British Resident and to come under the protection of Great Britain.

Negri Sembilan.

This confederation of "Nine States" consists of the four major States of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the five minor States of Ulu Muar, Jempul, Terachi, Gunung Pasir, and Inas. Sungai Ujong is mentioned in a Javanese poem in 1365 as being subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the 15th century it was ruled by Chiefs of the old kingdom of Malacca. Nearly all the Malay inhabitants of the "Nine States" are descended from immigrants from Minangkabau in Sumatra. Portuguese accounts prove that this immigration had begun in the 16th century. The original Malay federation consisted of Sungai Ujong, Klang (now a district of Selangor), Jelebu, Rembau, Naning (now part of Malacca), Segamat (now in Johore), Pasir Besar (also in Johore, its place having been taken by Johol),

A Johore prince, was sent by Aceh to rule it under Sultan Mudzaffar Shah. From 1650 Dutch endeavoured to get a monopoly exported from Perak, establishing near the Perak river several factories, which in the 16th century. The federation consisted of Sungai Ujong, Klang (now a district of Selangor), Jelebu, Rembau, Naning (now part of Malacca), Segamat (now in Johore), Pasir Besar (also in Johore, its place having been taken by Johol).
elai (now Inas), and Ulu Pahang, the region between he Ulu Seriting and Temerloh. After the wresting of Malacca from the Portuguese by the Dutch and the Johore Malays in 1641, Johore took a leading part in Negri Sembilan politics until 1773, when the chiefs of the four major States brought from Sumatra a Yam Tuan named Raja Melewar, ancestor of the present Yang di-pertuan Besar.

In 1874, the Dato' Klana, Chief of Sungai Ujong, the most important of the "Nine States," invited and obtained the assistance of the British Government to maintain his rule and the appointment of a British Resident. In 1883, Jelebu applied for a British Officer; and Remban agreed to refer all its disputes to the British Government, and in 1887 accepted a British adviser. In 1889, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and the Rulers of Tampin and Rembau asked for a Resident, and agreed to a confederation known as "the Old Negri Sembilan." In 1895, the Resident of this confederation took charge of Sungai Ujong and of Jelebu, and the modern Negri Sembilan was constituted. Finally, in 1898, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti was elected titular Ruler of the whole State.

Pahang.

Chao Ju Kua, a Chinese, writing about 1225 A.D., mentions Pahang as being subject to the old Sumatran Buddhist Kingdom of Sri Vijaya. Later, Pahang and Tioman are claimed as conquests of Majapahit. In the 15th century, Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca captured the Ruler of Pahang, and married his daughter. Before the Malacca royal house died out, in 1599, its Pahang branch provided several Rulers for the senior throne of Johore, which directly represented the Malacca dynasty. Later, Pahang fell under the suzerainty of the new Sultans of Johore, who, when they removed to Lingga, left a Dato' Bendahara in charge of Pahang.

In 1887 Sir Frederick Weld negotiated a treaty with the Bendahara of Pahang, promising British help in the event of external attack, and arranging for a British agent to be stationed at his capital. At the same time, the title of Sultan was substituted for that of Dato' Bendahara. In 1888, the Sultan applied for and obtained British protection, and the appointment of a Resident.

Constitution of the States.

The supreme authority in each State is vested in the Sultan, or the Ruler, in State Council. His Highness the Sultan or Ruler presides over the State Council. In 1932, the State Councils were reconstituted on the wider basis. In each of the four States they now include besides the British Resident, Malay chiefs and officials of the State, a number of unofficial members representative of Malay, European, Chinese, and Indian interests.

In Perak and Negri Sembilan there are second chambers which are concerned principally with matters of Malay customs and religion.

The Federation.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries into a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government, while all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand. The States agreed to an appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States* as the agent and representative of the British Government under the Governor of the Straits Settlements.

They agreed to follow the Resident-General's advice in all matters of administration other than those touching Islam. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. At this meeting many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The Decentralization Policy.

Federation proved a great stimulus to commerce and development, but its effect was to weaken the powers of the Rulers and the Residents and to concentrate authority in the Federal headquarters. In order to curtail the powers of the Resident-General and the Federal machine, the Federal Council with the High Commissioner himself as President was created and the title of Resident-General was changed to that of Chief Secretary to Government. In spite of this, however, the Federation while enjoying great prosperity became increasingly an amalgamation rather than a true Federation and a point was reached when the individuality of the States was in danger of becoming submerged. His Majesty's Government therefore decided upon a policy of decentralization. In 1927 a small measure of financial control was restored to the States. In the same year the Rulers withdrew by agreement from active membership of the Federal Council while the membership of the Council was increased to give it a more representative character. In 1931, the High Commissioner (Sir Cecil Clementi) made public far-reaching proposals for giving effect to the decentralization policy, and in 1932 the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies (Sir Samuel Wilson) visited Malaya to investigate. The report made by Sir Samuel Wilson was approved by His Majesty's Government and the changes recommended are gradually being carried out. The State Councils have been reconstituted and strengthened. Ten large departments have been transferred from the Federal to the State authority. In 1936 the post of Chief Secretary to Government was abolished and replaced by that of a Federal Secretary who has executive authority in Federal matters only and who is also the channel of communication from the States to the High Commissioner. The administrative powers previously possessed by the Chief Secretary to Government have been distributed between the States and the Federal Secretary according to whether the matter is of State or Federal concern, and his statutory powers have also been transferred to the High Commissioner or to the appropriate State or Federal authority. A considerable volume of financial provision has been transferred to State control but there is still a common purse from which block grants are made to each constituent State for its annual needs. The objective

* The title of this post was later altered to Chief Secretary to Government.
is a true Federal system in which the functions of the Federal and the State authority shall be mutually exclusive. Decentralization will not be complete until the States have had restored to them the power of collection and appropriation of their own revenues other than those required for Federal purposes and have undertaken the liability of balancing their own budgets with State revenues.

Climate.

The temperature of the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula has but a small annual range. On the East Coast, however, the North-East Monsoon, lasting from November until March, causes a distinct contrast with the rest of the year with regard to temperature, wind and rainfall. At Jelebu, in Negri Sembilan, the driest station where records have been kept, the average rainfall for 1891-1936 was 65 inches, but in the mountains the average yearly rainfall is very high, being nearly 250 inches near Taiping. The heat is at times oppressive, but the nights generally are cool. On some of the higher mountains (5,000 feet) the night temperature has been known to fall to 36°F. In the daytime there is almost always a breeze to modify the heat. The Peninsula lies within the region of the South-West and North-East Monsoons, but the only really strong regular wind is the North-East Monsoon, which strikes the East Coast from the China Sea. Violent squalls, known as "Sumatras," are not infrequent on the West Coast of the Peninsula between April and October. Generally they are of short duration and occur during the night.

Population.

The result of the census, taken in 1931, shows that the population of the Federated Malay States has increased during the decade from 1,324,890 to 1,713,096 or by 29.3%.

The population as estimated at mid-year 1938 from the formula, census 1931 + births - deaths + migrational surplus, was as follows:

| Population Group | Estimated Mid-year 1938 |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Malays of British Malaya | 443,618 |
| Other Peoples of Malay Archipelago | 150,113 |
| Chinese | 711,540 |
| Indians | 379,996 |
| Europeans | 6,350 |
| Eurasians | 4,251 |
| Others | 17,228 |
| **Total** | **1,713,096** |

Railways.

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also in the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis, and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (121 miles), extending from Johore Bahru at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, and Province Wellesley to Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—488 miles from Singapore. From Bukit Martajam near Prai, the line proceeds northwards through Province Wellesley and the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar, 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Royal State Railways of Siam was opened on July 1st, 1918, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,195 miles. Through services are in operation between Panang and Bangkok, the journey occupying 28 hours.

The East Coast Line proceeds northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan, Pahang and Kelantan to Tumpat on the North-East Coast of the Unfederated State of Kelantan, 328 miles from Gemas. At 141 miles the line passes through Kuala Lipis, the Capital of Pahang and at 187½ miles crosses the Pahang-Kelantan Border. Guillemand Bridge across the Kelantan River at 292 miles is the largest bridge in Malaya. It is 2,166 feet long and consists of 5 spans of 250 feet and 5 spans of 150 feet. The East Coast Line provides an alternative route to Siam.

An extension from Pasir Mas in Kelantan runs in a westerly direction for 11½ miles to the Golok River at the Siamese Boundary, where it joins with the Siamese line running to Haad Yai Junction, where connection is made with the main Bangkok-Penang line.

Through working between the Federated Malay States and Kelantan via the Royal State Railways of Siam commenced in 1921, and via the East Coast Railway in 1931.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson Wharf and Port Weld.

A causeway designed to carry two railway tracks and a roadway has been built across the Johore Strait, connecting the Island of Singapore with the Peninsula.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States Railway Administration is 1,068 miles.

The line is of metre gange.

On the West Coast main line, there are sleeping saloons and buffet cars on night mail trains and restaurant cars on day mail trains. An air-conditioned first class coach is attached to day mail trains between Kuala Lumpur and Prai. On the East Coast Line sleeping saloons run from Tumpat to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and vice versa on the Through Weekly Express, an observation coach being attached to the rear of the trains between Tumpat and Gemas.

Expenditure on Capital Account up to the 31st December, 1937, was $227,800,693, of which $50,038,653 was contributed from Loan Funds and the remainder has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States and from Railway surpluses.

Roads.

The mileage of metallled roads maintained by the Public Works Department is 2,939, of which approximately 2,183 mile or 74.8 per cent. have been bituminously treated, and is made up as follows:

| State | Miles |
|-------|-------|
| Perak | 1,002 |
| Selangor | 926 |
| Negri Sembilan | 554 |
| Pahang | 457 |

Total | 2,939 |
These roads connect up all townships of importance throughout the Federated Malay States.

The total expenditure on the maintenance of metallic roads in 1937 amounted to $2,447,709-73 and the average cost of up-keep per mile was about $833 compared with $715 in 1936.

In addition to metallised roads, approximately 1,619 miles of unmetalled roads and bridle paths were maintained.

Poste, Savings Bank, Telegraphs and Telephones.

A well-organised postal service is maintained throughout the Federated Malay States. The parcel post, cash-on-delivery, insurance, money order and postal order services extend to a great number of countries abroad. There are 104 post offices at which officers of the Posts and Telegraphs Department are employed, and 74 postal agencies where postal work is performed by Station Masters and others. Frequent mail services are in operation with various countries overseas through Port Swettenham and through the Straits Settlements ports in Singapore and Penang.

Savings facilities are afforded at all post offices during most of the hours they are open for public business. The Savings Bank is guaranteed by Government and is under the control of the Department. Interest is paid on deposits at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum.

The Public Telegraph and Telephone System of the Federated Malay States is provided and maintained by the P. & T. Department and consisted at 31st December, 1937, of 3,068 miles of overhead lines carrying 28,548 miles of wire. In addition, there were 203 miles of underground and submarine cables with 17,455 miles of single wire. This included 121 miles of overhead line through Johore, connecting the F.M.S. and Singapore.

The Postal Telegraph System extends throughout the Federated Malay States and is interconnected with the Railway Telegraph System; Railway Telegraph Offices being available for public telegrams where no Postal Telegraph Office exists. At the smaller offices telegrams are transmitted by telephone. Telegraph Lines connect the more important offices to one another, to Singapore, Penang and Malacca in the Straits Settlements, and to various offices in Johore, Kedah, Kelantan and Trengganu; the whole forming the Malayan Telegraph System. There are flat rates for telegrams throughout this system. International telegraphic communication is through Singapore and Penang.

The Telephone System extends throughout the Federated Malay States. There are at present 86 public exchanges, maintaining a continuous night and day service and 42 other places at which Call Offices are maintained, giving a service restricted to the hours during which the local Post Office is open for the transaction of public business. The majority of Post Offices in the Federated Malay States are provided with public telephone facilities. Public Call Office facilities are also available at a number of Railway Stations. At most of the remaining places, calls including trunk calls, can in case of emergency be made from the local Police Stations.

All the exchanges are connected by means of trunk lines and trunk communication (which may also be obtained from Call Offices) is possible between all exchanges. In case of emergency, trunk calls may be made from the local Police Stations when the Call Offices are closed.

The Federated Malay States telephone system is connected with the telephone system in Singapore, Malacca, Johore, Penang, Province Wellesley, and Kedah.

Customs and Excise.

The trade of the Federated Malay States is principally an export trade in raw materials and produce—agricultural, forest, marine and mineral—in exchange for imports of food, tobacco, fuel oils, clothing and machinery. The export trade was principally with the Colony of the Straits Settlements, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, while the import trade was principally with the Colony of the Straits Settlements, United Kingdom, British India and Burma, Netherlands Indies, and Siam.

In 1937 the aggregate value of trade was $488 millions, an increase of over 42 per cent. when compared with the previous year.

The four Federated Malay States form a single customs unit. The tariff list covers a wide range of dutiable articles and makes provision for a preferential rate of duty on certain goods produced or manufactured in the British Empire. The principal articles subject to duty are as follows:—Tobacco, liquors, petroleum, sugar, matches, edible oils and fats, cement, cosmetics and perfumery, textiles and wearing apparel, leather, cycles, tyres, milk, jam and preserved fruits, coffee, tea, linoleum, brassware, printing paper and electric batteries. Exports:—Rubber, tin and tin-ore, tungsten and other metalliferous ores.

Rubber is subject to a cess of 0-15 cent. per lb. upon export.

Details of the tariff can be obtained in London at the Malayan Information Agency, at Malaya House, 57, Trafalgar Square.

Perak.

His Highness Sultan Abdul Aziz A'mu' Tassim Billah Shah, K.C.M.G.

Perak is the most northerly of the Federated States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south and having an area of 7,980 square miles. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress.

The State is well watered, the Perak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus, the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai), being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau, and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoriums have been established on the Larut Hills at heights varying from 3,300 to 4,500 feet. Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian District the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of 61,000 acres of land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation for rice. A similar scheme with an area of 24,000 acres is in course of development in the Sungei Manik area in Lower Perak. So far 8,000 acres are available of which 3,800 were planted in 1937.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang, and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is (a) 1,002 of metalled and (b) 77 of unmetalled cart roads, 715 miles of bridle paths.

The British Resident has residencies at Taiping, the Headquarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Perak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Perak, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory which was taken over in 1909 and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles of area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legeh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasek on the Keladi border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

By an Act of Parliament which received the Royal assent on November 16th, 1934, the territory of the Dindings was restored to Perak and has formed part of the State since February, 1935. The area of the Territory, which contains the natural harbour of Lumut, is 190 square miles.

Selangor.

His Highness Sir Hjazuddin Alam Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Ala'idin Suleiman Shah.

Selangor, situated on the Western side of the Peninsula is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca and has an area of 3,160 square miles.

Its coast line extends for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor; the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The natives are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts, viz.: Kuala Lumpur, Ulu Langat, Klang, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor, each under a District Officer.

The Capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula with a population of 127,124 (1937). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 140 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence.

There were 502 Schools in the State in 1937 including 57 English Schools, 87 Malay Schools, 202 Tamil Schools and 156 Chinese Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River, and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels which called at the port in 1937 was 7,234,376.

The total revenue of the State in 1937 was $32,733,798 and the expenditure $26,524,910. There is no public debt except such as is included in the public debt of the Federation.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise and land. Import duties are charged on spirituous liquors, wines, beers, petroleum, tobacco, matches and alum. In 1937 the gross total value of imports was $69,788,900 and the exports $128,800,476.

The chief industries of the State are tin mining and rubber planting. At the end of 1937 the area under rubber cultivation was 508,598 acres, and the value of cultivated rubber exported during 1937 was $63,971,840. The area alienated for mining is 50,725 acres, and the quantity of tin exported in 1937 was 546,834 pikuls valued at $49,047,005. At the end of 1937 the area under coffee was 9,038 acres. In 1937 there were 117,749 acres under coconuts. The area under pineapples is rapidly increasing and there were 9,455 acres planted with this crop at the end of 1937. Rice and other products are also grown with success.
Negri Sembilan (The Nine States).

His Highness Tuanku Abdulrahman, K.C.M.G., ibni al-Marhum Tuanku Muhammad, Yang Di-pertuan Besar.

The confederation of States known as Negri Sembilan lies on the Western side of the Peninsula and is bounded on the North-west by Selangor, on the North-east by Pahang, on the East by Johore, on the South by Malacca, and on the South-west by the sea.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungai Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District Officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Kuala Pilah, at Tampin, and at Seremban.

The value of imports amounted to $9,222,079 in 1937 and that of exports to $45,201,119. The revenue of the State, which in 1937 amounted to $11,425,313, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1937, 9,365 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 537,866 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs exist in Gemenehoh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the Settlement of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coconuts. During 1937 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:

- Rubber: 372,217 acres
- Rice: 34,390 acres
- Coconuts: 6,041 acres

Other cultivation covered:

- Oil palm: 2,024 acres
- Fruit trees: 8,013 acres

Educational facilities comprise 64 Malay Vernacular Schools, 7 English Schools, 88 Tamil Schools, and 73 Chinese Schools.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 554 miles of metalled roads, of which 428 miles were bituminously treated.

Estimated population, at the end of 1937, Negri Sembilan, 264,742.

Pahang.

His Highness al-Sultan Abu Bakar Ri'ayatul-Din Mu'adzal-am Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni al-Marhum al-Mu'tasim Bi'llah al-Sultan Abdu'ullah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor, and Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation, with an area of 13,830 square miles.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Riam, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantam, Triang, Bera, Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming part of the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 297 miles, of which 232 are navigable for houseboats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Bentong, Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast Line of the Federated Malay States Railways runs through Pahang and is now open for traffic as far as Tumpat, Kelantan.

There is a motor car service both ways from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Lipis, 119 miles; also from Jerantut Station on the Railway to Kuantan, a distance of 109 miles.

The total mileage of metalled roads in Pahang is 457 miles. A road from Batu Talam to Kuala Medang has been completed up to the 22nd mile post and it is hoped to link this road with Kuala Lipis, when funds are made available.

The total revenue of the State during 1937 amounted to $7,201,650 and the expenditure to $7,478,079.

There are 5 Government English Schools, 3 Private English Schools, 90 Malay Boys' Schools, 6 Malay Girls' Schools, 18 Tamil Schools, and 35 Chinese Schools. There are 3 private English Schools at Bentong, Kuantan and Mentakab respectively. In addition there are three private schools at hill stations for European children only, viz., one at Fraser's Hill and two at Cameron Highlands, with a total enrolment at the end of 1937 of 151.

MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

JOHORE.

His Highness Sir Ibrahim, D.K., S.P.M.J., G.C.M.G., G.B.E., etc., Sultan and Sovereign Ruler of the State and Territories of Johore.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the North by Pahang, on the North-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the West by the Straits of Malacca, on the South by the Straits of Tebrau, and on the East by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,500 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the North-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the North, which, during part of its course forms the boundary with Pahang and Johore; and the Johore river which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bahru, the capital, situated on the Straits, opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Penggaram in Batu Pahat.

The climate approximates to that of Singapore and the Federated Malay States, the highest maximum and the lowest minimum temperature in 1937 being 99° F. and 60° F. respectively.

The estimated mean population (1937) was 613,510 of whom 267,500 were Malaysians. The population of Johore Bahru town was estimated as 24,277.

In area, Johore approximates to Wales.

History.

Of Johore history little is known prior to the advent of the Portuguese. A number of semi-wild "proto-Malay" tribes exist chiefly along the coast, while the civilised occupants of the country are the descendants of the Malays who brought their civilization from Palembang in Sumatra.

As the Buddhist State of Palembang grew in power, colonies of Malays commenced to settle on the Peninsula. Singapore, founded under the name of Tamsenek about this time, was ruled by its own kings. A Siamese law of 1360 includes Ujung Tanah (or Johore), Malaka, and Malayu among tributary states.

About 1365 A.D. Javanese from Majapahit conquered the country and destroyed Singapore.

Malacca then grew to be the first trading centre of the East, and after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511, a son of the conquered King settled at Johore Lama and founded the historic Sultanate of Johore.

The history of the next 300 years, however, is an almost uninterrupted record of wars. Persistent hostilities with the Portuguese continued even after the arrival of the Dutch in 1602. The State bears no small part in Dutch Colonial history; relations were friendly, despite a diplomatic struggle for commercial privileges. But, after violent attacks by the Achinese, Johore had become by 1637 practically an appanage of the Achinese Kingdom. In return for assistance rendered at the successful attack on Malacca in 1641, the Dutch tried to restore Johore to its former position as the premier Malay State. A port with a customs officer existed at Singapore. But the capital was plundered and burnt by Jambi in 1673, in 1699 the Sultan was assassinated, and in 1717 the throne was seized by a Sumatran adventurer, Raja Keechil. Then the Bugis ships appeared. The subsequent process, partly conquest, partly assimilation, while disturbing to Johore, resulted in a wide extension of its sovereignty, which now spread to Pahang, Siak, Riau, Linggi and part of Selangor.

After 60 years of continuous intrigues between the Malay and Bugis chiefs the Dutch in 1784 recognised the Malay Sultan as ruler of Johore, drove the Bugis from Riau and stationed there a Resident with a garrison; after some further fighting the Malay Sultan and the Bugis viceroy accepted the position of dependent princes, but the old empire of Johore (Linggi and Klang had been ceded to the Dutch in 1757) was in a state of dissolution, the Bendahara and Temenggong being virtually territorial chiefs in Pahang and Johore respectively. This was
the position when the English, by virtue of treaties made in 1819 and 1824, obtained a complete cession of the island of Singapore.

Contemporary visitors emphasize the then deserted character of the country; in 1847 the capital consisted merely of 25 huts. (In 1855 the capital was moved to its present situation at Johore Bahru.) But the extension of the Pax Britannica and the assistance rendered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements "helped Johore to grow populous again;" moreover, the country has been governed since 1855 by two enlightened and progressive rulers, Sultan Abubakar, who died in 1896, and Sultan Ibrahim the present ruler.

In 1895 the Sultan undertook to receive a British Agent having the functions of a Consular Officer; in 1910, the Sultan having had an unofficial adviser for some years, reorganised his Government with the assistance of the Governor of the Straits Settlements; in 1914 a General Adviser with enlarged powers was appointed. The recent history of the State has been a record of continued prosperity. Telephonic communication was established between Johore and Singapore in 1883; a postal service was inaugurated in 1884, letters being transported by coach till the opening of the railway across Singapore Island in 1903; in 1909 the Johore State railway, linking up with the Federated Malay States Railway system, was completed; finally, in 1924, the completion of the causeway across the Straits permits uninterrupted railway connection between Singapore and Bangkok.

**Constitution.**

In 1895 the late Sultan promulgated a written constitution, to which supplements have been added. His Highness has a Council of Ministers, consisting entirely of high Malay Officers of State, together with an Executive Council consisting of certain Malay and British officers.

The Orders of the Executive Council are carried out by a Civil Service containing Malay and European Officers.

The Legislature consists of a Council of State, to which Asiatic and European official and unofficial members are appointed.

The Judicial system resembles that of the Federated Malay States, minor cases being decided by Magistrates with appeal to the Supreme Court, and major cases by the Supreme Court, with appeal to the Court of Appeal, and thence in special cases to the Privy Council.

Cases involving matters regulated by Muhamadan law are decided in the Court of Kathi, with appeal to the Sultan in Executive Council.

Judges of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and of the Federated Malay States are ex-officio Judges of the State of Johore, and vice versa.

There is no Public Debt.

Johore is primarily an agricultural State. Forest reserves amount to 722,783 acres and are being largely increased.

The total area of alienated land in 1937 was 1,303,437 acres.

The chief agricultural exports in 1937 were:

| Area | Value of Exports |

- Tin-ore, 1,077 tons,
- Iron-ore, 619,339 tons,
- Bauxite, 12,627 tons,
- China clay, 30 tons,

the total value of mineral exports amounting to $6,171,997.

The chief imports comprise rice, wines and spirits, tobacco, wood and timber (largely Johore produce re-imported from Singapore), cotton-goods and petroleum products.

A branch of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is established at Johore Bahru and at Muar, and there are Chinese banks at Batu Pahat and Muar.

Manufacturing industries are in their infancy, being confined to 10 pineapple factories, 4 tapioca factories, and a few saw-mills, brickworks, and similar undertakings.

Electric power stations have been erected at Johore Bahru, Muar, Segamat, Batu Pahat, Kinang and Kota Tinggi.

**Communications.**

**Sea.—** Regular steamship services run between the various coast ports and Singapore.

During 1937, 77 ocean-going steamers with a tonnage of 286,810; 2,771 coasting steamers with a tonnage of 133,627; and 9,846 sailing vessels with a tonnage of 249,050 entered ports in the State.

The only ocean-going steamers that call are Japanese which visit Batu Pahat for the transport of iron-ore. The total weight of ore so cleared was 519,339 tons in 1937.

**Railway.—** The Johore State Railway runs for 120 miles through the middle of the State from Gemas on the northern boundary to Johore Bahru on the southern boundary; it is connected on each boundary with the system of the Federated Malay States Railway administration, by whom it was built and to whom it is leased.

**Road.—** At the end of 1937 the State possessed 875 miles of metalled and gravelled roads, and 9 miles of earth roads as well as 69 miles of approach roads and back lanes. All the principal towns are now connected by a road system which is being continually extended.

Hired cars provide a cheap, constant, and rapid means of communication. About 1,200 motor vehicles a day cross the causeway connecting the main land with Singapore Island.

**Poste, Telegraphs, Telephones.—** In addition to the General Post Office at Johore Bahru, 24 branch offices are established.
44 telephone exchanges are in operation, and the number will be increased. Communication is established between Johore Bahru and Singapore, and between Muar and the Malacca and Federated Malay States systems.

Accommodation.—The Johore Station Hotel at Johore Bahru provides the usual accommodation for travellers. The Government also maintains Rest Houses at Muar, Batu Pahat, Kota Tinggi, Segamat, Batu Anam, Mersing, and Kluang.

General.

Health.—Government Hospitals, Outdoor Dispensaries, Women and Children's Clinics and Dental Clinics, are established in the principal townships, besides a Mental Hospital and Leper Asylum at Johore Bahru. Permanent anti-malarial measures are being undertaken in Johore Bahru and other townships, and culling operations are in force in all towns.

Travelling dispensaries have been provided.

Education.—The Government has established six English Schools and 139 Vernacular Schools. Grants-in-aid are made to estate Tamil Schools.

Military Forces.—The total strength of the Johore Military Forces in 1937 amounted to 929. There are English and Malay Volunteer contingents.

Police.—The force numbers 1,344, all ranks: the rank and file consist of Malays and Sikhs under Malay and English Officers.

Municipal.—Town Boards are established at Johore Bahru, Muar, Batu Pahat, Segamat, Kota Tinggi, Kluang and Endau, supervising sanitary work in various Town Board Areas and many village areas.

Sport.—Subject to the regulations for the protection of wild animals, special permits may be obtained to shoot elephant, guar, rhinoceros, tapir, deer, tiger, panther, crocodile, and pig.

KEDAH.

His Highness Sir Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibni Ahmad Tajudin, K.O.M.G., Sultan; His Highness Tunku Badlishah, C.M.G., Regent.

Kedah is a State on the West coast of the Malay Peninsula, situated between the parallels of 5° 03' and 6° 40' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 40' and 101° 10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (North and East) by the States of Songkhla and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sanglang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah; Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the South. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the North of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern water-shed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 101 miles in length and about 64 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi groups, about 3,660 square miles. The two highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Jerai (3,978 feet) and Bukit Payak (3,823 feet). Gunong Raya, on Langkawi Island, is 2,888 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammadanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was at various times under the domination of Malacca, Aceh and Slam. Like the other States too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul, Perlis and part of Songkhla on the North, and Krian on the South, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Opperoofden (commandants) in Kedah from 1654 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammad Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1843 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis, and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammadans. Only a few families of the aborigines (Semang) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River; 209 "nomadic aboriginals" were counted at the 1931 census.

South Kedah, the area lying South of the mountain known as Kodah Peak (Gunong Jerai), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying land along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang and to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 338,558 at the 1921 census and 429,091 at the 1931 census. At mid 1937...
the population was estimated to be 474,775, of whom 319,260 were Malays, 631 Europeans, 85,472 Chinese, 56,402 Indians, and 13,010 "other races."

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered, with the exception of a deposit of marble which is described as the equal of any in Europe.

Climate.

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the day-time rising to over 92° F. and falling to nearly 71° F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

Communications.

Steamers ply between Penang and Sungai Patani (Central Kedah), and between Penang and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 45 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road extends to Kuala Nerang at the 23rd mile from Alor Star. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak, and other metalled roads have been completed or are under construction. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns; 225 miles of canals are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Martajam, in Province Wellesley, and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier; trains have been running regularly since October, 1915. A connection through Perlis with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

There is an aerodrome at Alor Star.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There are English schools in Alor Star (450 pupils) and Sungai Patani (115 pupils) and a Malay Girls' school in Alor Star. There are 87 Malay schools, including 5 Girls' schools.

Constitution.

Until the beginning of this century the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1905, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

In 1906, the Sultan by an edict appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country. The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud.

In 1913, the Sultan's health became such that it was necessary to appoint a Regent. His Highness' eldest son, H.H. Tunku Ibrahim, C.M.G., C.V.O., remained Regent till his death in 1934. The present Regent is H.H. Tunku Badlishah, C.M.G.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Under the terms of the agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the State of Kedah dated the 1st November, 1923, the supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council, which Council consists of His Highness the Sultan as President, three other Malay members selected by name or office by His Highness with the approval of His Excellency the High Commissioner for the Malay States, and the British Adviser.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1905 from Siam was of $2,600,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent., but the whole amount has been paid off and the State is now free from debt. Accumulated surplus funds (excess of Assets over Liabilities) amounted to $7,737,435 at the end of 1956, in addition to an "Opium Revenue Replacement Fund" with investments valued at $6,273,161.

Public revenue and expenditure:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| A.D. 1356 (A.D. 1937-1938) | $7,544,682 | $6,625,653 |

Trade.

The following are the principal exports from Kedah:—Padi and rice, rubber, copra, arecanuts, tapioca and sago, forest produce, tin-ore, fish, bricks, cattle, hides and horns, pigs and poultry.

The value of the Kedah trade with the Straits Settlements during 1937 was as follows:—Exports, $24,724,437; imports, $11,686,917.

The value of Kedah trade with the F.M.S. during 1937 was: Exports, $2,533,051; imports, $154,686.

PERLIS.

His Highness Syed Aliwi, K.B.E., C.M.G., Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the West coast of the Malay Peninsula, North of Kedah. Its area is 316 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth Raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano.

The Federated Malay States Railway runs through the State and connects with the Siamese railway system at Padang Besar. H.H. the Raja resides at Arau which is on the railway. The main Government Offices are at Kangar, about six miles from Arau. There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Kangar and a telephone system exists between the police stations in the State. Perlis is also connected by telephone trunk service with the Federated Malay States, Johore and Singapore. Padang Besar is in telephonic connection only through the Railway telephone system. There are 45 miles of metalled roads and 41½ miles of gravelled roads and paths kept up by Government.

The population is 52,703 (middle 1937) of whom 43,497 are Malays. Public revenue and expenditure:

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1356 A.H. (A.D. 1937-38) | $728,531 | $634,483 |

The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. Repayment of these loans was completed in 1929. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam was replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The relations between Perlis and Great Britain are defined in a Treaty signed at Arau on 28th April, 1930.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are five other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

KELANTAN.

His Highness the Sultan Isemal ibni Almarhum Sultan Mohamed IV, K.C.M.G.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 4° 32' and 6° 15' North, and between longitudes 101° 19' and 102° 37' East. It is bounded on the North by the China Sea; on the East by Trengganu and the China Sea; on the South by Pahang, and on the West by Perak and Siamese territory. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,750 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the State according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the South; Gunong Taham, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabal, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1931 census was 362,517, including 330,774 Malays, 17,612 Chinese, 6,752 Indians, 124 Europeans, 32 Eurasians, and 7,223 others. The total population estimated for 1937 was 400,378, of whom over 354,000 were Malays, 27,000 Chinese, 10,000 Indians, and 80 Europeans.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, had a population of about 14,843 people (1931 census). It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has 30 Malay vernacular schools attended by some 3,001 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Pahang has been completed. Communications were well maintained and during 1937 there were no serious interruptions to record. The north-east monsoon did no serious damage to communications. Whenever the main telegraph circuit with Kuala Lumpur was interrupted, the Knala Krai wireless station was used instead. There are three wireless transmitting and receiving sets in Kelantan, one at Kota Bharu, belonging to the Royal Air Force, one at Kemubu and one at Kuala Krai, both belonging to the Federated Malay States Railways. Kota Bharu is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Puteh, Kuala Krai, Pasir Mas, Bachok and Palek-bang. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 3,431), Bachok (population 776), on the coast, Pasir Puteh (population 1,308) and Kuala Krai, the headquarters of the southern district of the State. The trunk road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai is open for traffic.

Pasir Puteh is connected with Kota Bharu by a road which is practicable in all weathers. Since the opening in 1931 of the East Coast Railway, there has been direct communication with Singapore through Pahang. Beside the daily slower trains, a fast through Mail Train with sleeping berths runs once a week in each direction and does the journey in less than 24 hours. There is also a daily train service between Tumpat and Penang via the Royal Siamese Railway.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil varies considerably in fertility; many of the rubber estates are on soil of volcanic origin, which is of renowned fertility. The chief product is padi, the last harvest of which amounted to 46,500 tons. Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown in the coastal plain. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, para rubber has been largely planted in recent years; in addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. The area under rubber is about 90,000 acres, of which rather more than one half comprises Asiatic holdings. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, though it has been necessary periodically to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. Of indigenous crafts the most important is weaving. Hand printing of cotton goods is a new and flourishing industry. The export...
of sarongs to neighbouring States is on the increase.

Mining has not yet been fully developed. There are indications of considerable deposits of tin-ore which are now being prospected by some important tin-mining interests. These will, it is hoped, form a valuable reserve but they will not be immediately available under the existing system of international tin control. Manganese-ore and iron-ore are found in considerable quantities and the exploiting of these minerals offers a hopeful field for new development.

Alluvial gold is widely distributed over the Southern area of the State but seldom in paying quantities. Hopeful prospectors are still seeking for the gold-bearing lode which it is hoped may be found somewhere between the rich lode at Litcho, just over the Siamese border, and the gold-bearing lodes of Pahang.

The quantities and values of minerals exported during the last three years have been as follows:

| Year | Tons   | Value     |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1935 | 10,678-15 | $132,260 |
| 1936 | 10,005-84 | 124,571 |
| 1937 | 9,667-37 | 120,827 |
| 1935 | 48,223-00 | 166,892 |
| 1936 | 7-49      | 9,985    |
| 1937 | 27-16     | 33,067   |
| 1935 | 44-60     | 60,726   |

Tin.—A further advance in tin production was made during the year, the figure rising from the 1936 total of 27-2 tons tin-ore to 44-6 tons, equivalent to 33-7 tons of tin at 75-5% assay. The export figures for the past four years are as follows:

| Year | Tons   |
|------|--------|
| 1934 | 4-3    |
| 1935 | 7-5    |
| 1936 | 27-2   |
| 1937 | 44-6   |

Iron.—The Japanese Mine at Bukit Besi, near Temangan, owned by the Southern Mining Company Ltd., made their first shipment of iron-ore in May, and during the seven months May to October, exported a total amount of 48,223 tons, the value of which was estimated at $196,892. The duty collected was nearly $20,000. The ore is at present transported in buckets via an aerial rope-way to the F.M.S. railway line at Bukit Besi Halt, thence by rail, lighter, and ship to Japan. The aerial rope-way has a limited capacity, and the possibility of laying down a railway line to connect with the F.M.S.R. at a point near Temangan is now being investigated.

Gold.—As in previous years the bulk of the gold produced in Kelantan resulted from the activities of the licensed individual dulong washers, mostly Chinese. The number of licences issued was 1,162 as compared with 1,506 in 1936. No large undertaking involving heavy capital expenditure can be expected until the existence of considerable reserves of ore has been proved.

Manganese-ore.—A Japanese-owned company is exploiting a limited manganese-ore area near Gual Periok and exporting a regular 10,000 tons a year. An important manganese-ore deposit in a remote area near Gunong Tahan is being investigated, but considerable difficulties in transport through wild and broken country will have to be overcome.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, rubber, cattle, betelnuts, dried fish, poultry, tin-ore, manganese-ore and iron-ore. The chief imports are rice, tobacco, textile, provisions, kerosene oil, benzine, sugar, timber and planks, salt, machinery and tinned milk.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plains the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January and February, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoon keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The average rainfall on the coast is some 150 inches and on the plains further inland 150 inches.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.

Regular steamship communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

TRENGGANU.

His Highness Sulaiman Badarul'alam Shah ibni Almarhum Zainul'abidin, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 3° 53' and 5° 51' North, and longitude 102° 23' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 5,060 square miles.

The total population of the State, at the 1931 Census was 179,789, made up as follows:

| Group       | Population |
|-------------|------------|
| Malays      | 164,564    |
| Chinese     | 13,254     |
| Indians     | 1,371      |
| Europeans   | 35         |
| Eurasians   | 16         |
| Others      | 550        |
The total population estimated at mid 1937 was 196,246 calculated by geometrical method.

There are 175 miles of road open to traffic, including a road of 66 miles length from Kuala Trengganu which connects with the Kelantan road system at the boundary between Trengganu and Kelantan. There are also 170 miles of minor roads practicable except after heavy rain. There are no railways (except light railways on mines) and communication with the interior is mainly by means of rivers and paths. Telegraphic communication was established between the State, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements in 1922. There are telephone exchanges at Kuala Trengganu, Kemaman and Beaufort.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 14,060.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretir, Dungun, Paka, Marang, Ibai, Satiyu, and Beaufort.

The public revenue and expenditure for the year 1937 were $3,660,399 and $2,645,836 respectively.

The total value of exports from Trengganu in 1937 was $11,679,578 and of imports $6,443,326. The principal exports and imports were:

| Exports, 1937 | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Tin ore      | $863,720 |
| Para rubber  | $701,910 |
| Haematite    | $495,245 |
| Dried Fish   | $609,081 |
| Copra        | $139,459 |
| Manganese    | $171,329 |
| Areca-nuts   | $84,541 |
| Silk sarongs | $473,275 |

| Imports, 1937 | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| Rice         | $1,507,449 |
| Tobacco, cigars and cigarettes | $497,460 |
| Cotton and silk stuffs | $711,287 |
| Sugar        | $162,361 |
| Petroleum    | $392,091 |
| Tinned milk  | $131,666 |
| Machinery    | $148,393 |
| Locomotives  | $282,020 |

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the North-east monsoon from November to February. The annual average is about 115 inches. The temperature ranges between 75° and 92°F. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper. During part of the N.E. monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable.

British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909. The suzerainty of Siam, transferred on that date to Great Britain, was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the bunpa mas (golden leaves and flowers) to Bangkok. An agreement between His Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainul-'abidin was made on 22nd April, 1910, and a further Agreement was made on 24th May, 1919. Under these Agreements His Majesty's Government guarantees protection of the State from foreign aggression, and the Trengganu Government accepts a British Adviser whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues; the cost of this Adviser and his establishment to be determined by the High Commissioner and to be charged on the revenues of the State.

The ruling of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainul-'abidin through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

The Public Debt at the end of 1937 amounted to $3,000,000. It consists of loans by the Government of the Straits Settlements for the purpose of resumption of Ruling House Land Concessions, surveys, road construction and other development works.
