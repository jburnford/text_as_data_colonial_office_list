The State of Brunei lies between Longitude 114° and 116° East and forms two enclaves into the territory of Sarawak close to the boundary of that State with North Borneo. It has a coast line of some 100 miles extending from Brunei Bay in the East, in which lies the island of Labuan, one of the Straits Settlements, to the boundary of Sarawak near the Baram River in the West. It is distant 768 nautical miles by sea from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its Rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed
by many similar cessions to Rajahs of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 2,226 square miles, containing a population (1931 census) of 30,135, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and the outlying districts of Muara, Tutong, Belait and Temburong. Estimated population on 31st December, 1937, was 36,983.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of His Majesty's Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan. A further agreement was made at the end of 1906, under the terms of which the Sultan agreed to accept a British Resident to advise him and assist in the administration of the State.

Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915, a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei and the appointment of Assistant Resident was discontinued. At the beginning of 1931, however, the rapid development of the Belait district owing to the discovery of oil in commercial quantities necessitated the appointment of an additional officer of the Malayan Civil Service and the title of Assistant Resident was revived. European officers from the Malayan Establishment are in charge of the Public Works, Medical, Police, Agricultural and Forest Departments.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of 10,453 (1931 census). Besides the old Malay town which is built over the water on the Brunei River there is a new township on the mainland, which has steadily developed since 1910. The only other centre of any considerable population is Kuala Belait on the oil fields with a population of about 4,000.

The climate resembles that of the Federated Malay States, the average annual rainfall being a little over 100 inches.

There are Malay Vernacular schools at Brunei and in the out-districts as well as aided Chinese and English Schools in Brunei and Kuala Belait.

The Government maintains a small hospital at Brunei and two dispensaries in country districts, as well as travelling dispensaries which cover the whole State. There is also a hospital at Kuala Belait maintained by the British Malayan Petroleum Company which is made available for Government use. The birth rate was 40-09 per mille (1,472 births) and the crude death rate 21-47 per mille (772 deaths).

The Police Force consists of 86 non-commissioned officers and men under the Chief Police Officer, a Chief Inspector on deputation from the Straits Settlements Police.

There are six post offices in the State and 210,020 postal articles were dealt with in 1937.

Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 4,000 in the State. Native industries include fishing, cloth weaving, brass founding, and the manufacture of silverware. The principal imports are rice, cloth, tobacco, sugar and petroleum, and the principal exports crude oil, cutch (mangrove extract), wild and plantation rubber, sago and dried prawns. All trade passes through Labuan.

In 1924 the British Malayan Petroleum Company, Limited, commenced prospecting and drilling operations for petroleum in the Belait district. In 1930 it became definitely established that an oil-field of considerable commercial value had been found at Seria, 10 miles North-East of Kuala Belait. Production amounted to 566,906 tons in 1937, valued at $3,992,782.

Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber. Exports in 1937 amounted to 1,770 tons valued at $1,240,995.

A cutch factory established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei. The output of cutch in 1937 was 2,333 tons, valued at $212,239.

There are two native industries of importance, the manufacture of brassware and silverware. These are more or less restricted to certain families or guilds.

Weaving is done by Brunei women, and the natives are excellent fishermen.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from oil royalties, customs duties, and land and mining rents.

**Finances**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1937 | $1,049,293 | $653,149 |

There is no Public Debt.

**Communications**

There is regular communication with Labuan by small vessels of the Straits Steamship Company and thence with Singapore by weekly mail steamer.

A central Wireless Telegraph Station was opened in 1921 at Brunei with a subsidiary station at Labuan which enables telegraphic communication to be maintained by cable from Labuan with Singapore and other parts of the world. There are also Wireless Stations in the Belait and Temburong Districts.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.
