PALESTINE.

Palestine is bounded on the north by the States of Syria and the Lebanon, which are under French Mandate, on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian province of Sinai (the boundary running from a point west of Rafah on the Mediterranean to a point two miles to the west of where the talweg of the Wadi ‘Araba joins the Gulf of ‘Aqaba) and on the east by Trans-Jordan, which is included in the area of the Palestine Mandate.

The boundary on the north was determined by the Franco-British Convention of 23rd December, 1920, (Comd. 1195) and in pursuance of that Convention was delimited between the Mediterranean and El Hammé in 1922. The Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the French Government giving effect to the delimitation is published as Cmd. 1910 (Treaty Series No. 13 (1923)).

The frontier runs from the Mediterranean at Ras en Naqura eastwards to Yarun, thence N.E. to the village of Qadna, thence N.N.E. to Metulla and across the Jordan Valley to Tell el Qadi (in Palestine) and Banias (in Syria), thence S.S.W. to Jar Banat Ya’qub, thence southwards along the Jordan to the Lake of Tiberias, thence along the eastern shore of the Lake of Tiberias to a point almost due east of the town of Tiberias, thence S.S.E. to El Hammé Station on the Hejaz railway.

The frontier with Trans-Jordan is defined as a line drawn from a point two miles west of ‘Aqaba on the Gulf of ‘Aqaba up the centre of the Wadi ‘Araba, the Dead Sea and the River Jordan to the junction of the latter with the River Yarmouq, thence up the centre of the River Yarmouq to the Syrian frontier.

The Natural Divisions of Palestine.

Palestine comprises four zones of country:—

(a) The hill country of Galilee and Judaea,

(b) The five plains, including that lying in the rift of the Jordan Valley, which, from the north of Lake Tiberias to the Dead Sea, is actually below the level of the Mediterranean,

(c) The Beersheba area, different in character and population from the rest of the country,

(d) The desert area.

The five plains are:—The Acre Plain, the Plain of Esdraelon, the Huleh Plain, the Coastal Plain and the Plain of the Jordan.

Geology.

The Hill Country is composed principally of limestone which provides excellent building stone of various types and colours. Calcareous sandstone abounds along the coast and was used by the Crusaders for their maritimes forts and castles (Atlit and Acre); the new Haifa breakwater has been constructed of a similar stone from Atlit. Of metallic minerals, copper ores and deposits of manganese occur in the southern part of Palestine near the Gulf of ‘Akaba, but are not worked at present. Petroleum and bitumen exudations are found around the southern part of the Dead Sea. This region and the area westward as far as the Mediterranean Sea has been partially explored by Oil Companies. Exploration was suspended for a period during which oil mining legislation was undergoing revision. The new legislation came into operation on 1st September, 1938, and as a result active exploration for oil will probably be resumed. Of non-metallic ores, rock phosphate and bituminous limestone occur in large deposits on the slopes of the Judaean Wilderness. Rock salt occurs in unlimited quantity in the salt dome of Jebel Usdum and has been used for the supply of the Jerusalem market. A sulphur deposit of commercial importance has been located south of Gaza. A plant for treatment and concentration of the sulphur in the ore has now been installed. A good quality of gypsum is found at Menahemiya near Tiberias and impure varieties are found on the slopes of the Judaean Wilderness. Extensive deposits of anhydrite (anhydrous gypsum) occur overlying the rock salt at Jebel Usdum.

The production of potassium chloride and bromine by Palestine Potash Ltd. shows a substantial increase and the market has now become world wide. Large evaporating basins have now been constructed at the south end of the Dead Sea. Pumps have been erected and production on a large scale is expected. There are hot springs of medicinal value at Tiberias and El Hammé where bathing establishments on modern lines have been erected for the treatment of patients and, in addition, at El Hammé large baths for pleasure bathing and swimming in the waters of varying tepid temperatures are provided.

Climate.

The climate of Palestine varies with the altitude: the coastal region is sub-tropical and humid; the elevated, hilly zone is drier and more temperate, while the Jordan Valley is hot and the rainfall slight. The summer months are almost rainless. January and February are, in general, the wettest months and the main rainfall occurs between November and April. The rainfall varies largely, from a minimum of 2½ inches in the south to a maximum of 31 inches in the north.

Water for domestic use is obtained in the larger towns from piped supplies; in the smaller towns
Sea and the River Jordan to the towns from piped supplies; in the smaller towns
and rural districts, from rock cisterns in which rain water is collected or from small springs or wells.

Malaria, which was formerly very prevalent, has now been eradicated from the large towns and in rural areas a very marked reduction in incidence has been effected as a result of various large drainage schemes, anti-larval control, as well as by mass treatment of the population in those areas where the incidence of the disease was very high. One or two highly endemic areas remain to be dealt with on a permanent basis.

Epidemic diseases are not unduly prevalent.

Jerusalem Water Supply.

Jerusalem now has a pipe-borne, filtered, softened and sterilized water supply from Ras-El-Ain Springs (situated some 47 kilometres north-west from and 2,600 feet below Jerusalem). The pipe line is 60 kilometres long. The plant for the supply was installed by the Palestine Government.

All the earlier supplies established by the Military of Jerusalem Municipality were closed down in 1936.

The second service reservoir of 2,200,000 gallons and extension of 10" to 18" reticulation mains were completed in 1936 and further extensions of 8", 6", 5" and 4" mains have since been made.

Government.

Under Turkish rule, part of Palestine was in the Vilayet (Province) of Beirut and part in the Sandjak (District) of Jerusalem. After its conquest in 1917-1918 by the British forces, the country remained under British Military Administration until July, 1920, when Sir Herbert Samuel was appointed High Commissioner, and a Civil Administration set up.

By the Treaty of Peace, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey renounced all rights over Palestine. The Principal Allied Powers had selected His Britannic Majesty as Mandatory at the Conference at San Remo, on 25th April, 1920. The terms of the Mandate were approved by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th July, 1922, and the Mandate came into force on September 29th, 1923. The Mandatory is responsible, inter alia, for carrying into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration of November 2nd, 1917, viz.:—"His Majesty's Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish Communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

On the 1st September, 1922, a Constitution was promulgated.

Under this Constitution Palestine is governed by a High Commissioner, who is also the Commander-in-Chief, assisted by an Executive Council consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer and Commissioner on Special Duty, and by an Advisory Council consisting of heads of certain Departments.

An attempt was made in 1923 to create the Legislative Council provided for in the Constitution, but owing to the refusal of the Arabs to take part in the elections, it was replaced by the Advisory Council in order to secure the enactment of legislation until such time as a Legislative Council is created.

English, Arabic and Hebrew are the official languages of the country.

In 1921, a Supreme Moslem Council was constituted in order to control and manage Moslem Waqf and Sharia Courts in Palestine. It consists of a President known also as Ra'is-Al-Ulema, and four members.

The Council has established a Moslem Orphanage in Jerusalem, and has carried out important repairs of sacred buildings and extensive tree planting on Waqf land and in Moslem cemeteries.

Regulations were made under the Religious Communities Ordinance, 1926, by the High Commissioner in 1927 for the organization of the Jewish Community in Palestine. The Jewish community, like the Moslem and the various Christian communities enjoys autonomy in the administration of its internal affairs, religious, cultural and communal; it has also power to levy rates on its members. The organs of the community are a Chief Rabbiinate and local Rabbinical offices, an Elected Assembly, a General Council which is elected by the Assembly and represents the community in its dealings with the Government, and local communities.

Complete freedom in their communal affairs is allowed to those Jewish congregations who have exercised the option to remain outside the recognized community.

The Jewish Agency is recognized as the representative body of the Jewish people in all matters pertaining to the upbuilding of the Jewish National Home: it is represented in Palestine by an Executive whose headquarters are at Jerusalem.

The Palestine Government has maintained in force the status and privileges accorded to the different Christian Communities under the Ottoman regime.

The affairs of the towns are administered by Municipal Councils presided over by Mayors. In large villages Local Councils have been set up.

District Town Planning Commissions have now replaced the former Central Town Planning Commission and deal with town planning schemes in their districts put forward by Local Town Planning Commissions both for municipal and rural areas. A Town Planning Adviser who is "ex officio" member of all the District Town Planning Commissions is attached to the office of the Attorney-General. The preparation of regional schemes under his direction are now being considered.

Area and Population.

The country is, at present, divided into four districts—the Southern, Jerusalem, Haifa—Samaria and Galilee—Acre Districts—each administered by a District Commissioner.

Palestine, as administered by the Palestine Government, is 10,400 square miles in extent.

The population of this territory taken by Census on November 18th, 1931, was 1,035,821, of which number 387,291 were living in 23 towns and large villages and 66,653 were nomad bedouin. An estimate of the total population at 30.6.38 based on natural increase and excess of immigration is 1,418,618, of whom 895,161 were Moslems, 399,807 Jews, 111,794 Christians and 11,856 others. The Moslems include the nomad bedouin population, about whom no separate figures are available except those given in the Census of 1931 (66,553). The chief town, Jerusalem, which had been in Moslem hands since 1244, and under Turkish rule since 1517, surrendered to General Allenby on December 9th, 1917. Its population in 1931 was 90,503. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is visited annually by large numbers of Christian pilgrims, principally of the Orthodox and Coptic Churches. The site of Solomon's Temple is occupied by the Dome of the Rock, which contains a relic of Muhammad and the reputed sacrificial stone of Abraham. Bethlehem, the scene of Christ's Nativity and the birthplace of King David, is five miles south of Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity, at the east end of the present village, is said to be the oldest Christian church in existence.

The population figures of the other principal towns at the date of the Census (18.11.31) were:—
Jaffa, 51,866; Tel-Aviv, 46,101; Haifa, 50,403; Gaza, 17,046; Nazareth, 8,756; Nablus, 17,189; Safad, 9,441; Tiberias, 8,601; Hebron, 17,531; Ramle, 10,421; Bethlehem, 6,815; Lydda, 11,250; Acre, 7,897.

There has been great growth of the large towns in the years since the census and at the end of 1937 the estimated populations were: Jerusalem 126,000, Haifa 100,000, Tel Aviv 140,000, Jaffa 69,000.

**Jewish Colonisation.**

The total Jewish population of Palestine is estimated in June, 1938, to aggregate very nearly 400,000, and thus to constitute 28-2% of the settled population of the country. Jewish agricultural settlements number 227 and have a population of close on 106,000 persons. 123 of these settlements are situated on land of the Jewish National Fund which was established by the Zionist Organisation for the purpose of acquiring land as inalienable property of the Jewish people. The land owned by the Jewish National Fund amounted at the end of July, 1938, to 420,000 metric dunams. These settlements were equipped and financed by the Jewish Agency with the funds provided by the Palestine Foundation Fund (Keren Hayesod) which is the financial instrument of the Agency.

During the last seventeen years (April, 1921, to the end of March, 1938) the Keren Hayesod spent £P.2,259,000 on agricultural colonisation; £P.1,089,000 on education; £P.1,159,000 on labour and urban colonisation; £P.1,086,000 on immigration, health and social work, and £P.892,000 on other purposes—in all £P.6,494,000. The investment of the Jewish National Fund in land and improvements, afforestation, water supply, etc., amounted to three and three-quarter million pounds (to the end of June, 1938). The total receipts of the Zionist institutions during the year 1936-37 amounted to £P.1,362,000.

Extensive colonisation work has also been done by the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association (PICA) which took over the colonies established by Baron Edmond de Rothschild and founded new settlements. There are at present 24 such colonies under the PICA administration.

A number of settlements have been established on land acquired by private companies and individuals. The total area in Jewish possession amounted at the end of July, 1938, to 1,290,000 metric dunams. The main areas are located as follows:—Maritime Plain, 570,000; Plain of Esdrelon, 165,000; Jordan Valley, 120,000; hill country, 393,000 and 42,000 in the Negev. In addition 162,000 dunams of land and water have been granted by way of concession, half of which was granted to Jewish colonising institutions, and the other half to industrial concerns in which there is Jewish and non-Jewish capital. The total area held by Jews thus amounts to 1,452,000 dunams, i.e., to 5-3% of the total area of Palestine. The area under citriculture in Jewish villages amounts to about 160,000 dunams, the export thereof during the season 1937-38 having amounted to over seven million cases.

The Jewish urban population totals approximately 300,000, its main centres being:—Jerusalem and suburbs, 77,000; Tel Aviv, a purely Jewish city, 155,000, including the neighbouring Jewish quarters of Jaffa; Haifa and Haifa Bay, 58,000. In 1937 there were in the country 5,606 Jewish factories and artisans' workshops, employing 30,000 owners and wage-earners, possessing an invested capital of about £P.11,637,000, and having an annual output of £P.9,109,000, as compared with 1,850 establishments in 1921, possessing a capital investment of half a million pounds.

The Jewish community of Palestine is organised in accordance with the provisions of the Communities Ordinance and is represented by the General Council (Vaad Leumi); the latter controls the Hebrew School System and the Jewish Health Services. In the school system of the Vaad Leumi there were at the beginning of 1938, 391 schools attended by 49,661 pupils.

At the end of 1938, 80,000 Jewish workers were organised in the General Federation of Jewish Labour. The Federation has organised a comprehensive system of co-operative societies with branches in agriculture, transport, construction, building and credit. It also maintains a workers' sick fund, with 72,000 members in January, 1938, annual budget being £P.253,000.

The Jewish Agency, consisting of Zionists and non-Zionists, functions under the terms of Article 4 of the Palestine Mandate. It is recognised by the Mandatory Power as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in matters affecting the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population in Palestine. It is represented in Palestine by an Executive consisting of eight members.

**Education.**

In July, 1938, the approximate number of children in Palestine between the ages of 5 and 15 was 341,000, of whom 248,000 were Moslems, 68,000 Jews and 23,000 Christians.

The number of children of all ages who attended school in 1937-38 was 158,874, including 63,550 Moslems, 72,403 Jews, and 22,921 Christians.

The Arab Public System of Education, maintained by Government, embraced in that school year 402 schools with 49,400 pupils, the great majority of whom were Moslems. The schools included 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 99 men and 60 women students, and 11 schools with 23 secondary classes containing 581 secondary pupils. The Kadoorie Agricultural School at Tulkarm had 50 boarders. Technical education is provided in most of the larger schools and a Trade School was opened in 1938 with 51 boys. The Law School in Jerusalem had 219 students.

The Jewish and Christian Communities provide, the former almost entirely and the latter to a very large extent, for the education of their own children.

The Hebrew Public System, controlled by the General Council (Vaad Leumi) of the Jewish Community of Palestine, embraces 395 schools with 49,920 pupils. These included 4 Teachers' Training Colleges with 249 men and 453 women students, and 12 schools with 51 secondary classes containing 2,817 secondary pupils. There were also 227 private Jewish schools with 21,456 pupils, including 2 Teachers' Training Colleges with 118 women students and 15 secondary schools with 1,162 pupils.

There were 13 Jewish Agricultural schools with 1,088 pupils, 14 junior technical schools with 1,428 students, and a Technical Institute at Haifa with 499 students. The Hebrew University at Jerusalem had 733 students. The Hebrew Kadoorie Agricultural School which was opened at Mount Tabor in the summer, 1934, had 40 boarders.

The Christian schools, maintained by various foreign and religious bodies, numbered 193, with 24,046 pupils, 39 of these schools had 122 secondary classes with 1,866 pupils; the 3 agricultural schools had 93 pupils.

There were 97 private Moslem schools maintained by private persons and associations, with 8,364 boys and 2,149 girls. There were also 87 kuttabs or Koranic schools. These provided for 3,539 children, of whom 183 were girls.
Some non-Government schools receive a capitation grant-in-aid from the Department of Education, conditional on the acceptance of a certain measure of Government supervision and inspection. Grants totalling £P.46,352 were made to the Jewish Community of Palestine for its schools for the financial year 1936-7; these were raised to £P.53,365 in the financial year 1937-8.

The Palestine Board of Higher Studies was established in 1924. The Government and many educational institutions are represented on it. It conducts the Palestine Matriculation Examination and the Palestine Diploma Examination, both of which are public examinations recognised by Government. The Palestine Matriculation Examination is recognised by many British Universities.

Justice.

The Courts in Palestine are either Civil or Religious Courts. The former have jurisdiction over all matters save those of personal status and Waqfs or charitable endowments, subject to the provisions mentioned below.

There is a Magistrate's Court in each sub-district, and in the larger towns such as Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv, and Nablus, two or more such Courts.

There are five District Courts, each composed of a British President or Relieving President and two Palestinian Judges sitting at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv and Nablus respectively. They go on circuit within the area of their jurisdiction. A District Court has jurisdiction in first instance over all crimes except those punishable with death, and civil cases outside the jurisdiction of a Magistrate in and for that district; it also hears appeals subject to certain restrictions from the decisions of Magistrates both in civil and in criminal cases. A Registrar is attached to each of the District Courts and exercises certain judicial functions. Crimes punishable with death are tried by the Court of Criminal Assize, which consists of the Chief Justice or British Judge of the Supreme Court sitting with the President or Relieving President and a Palestinian Judge of the District Court.

The Supreme Court of Palestine is composed of the Chief Justice and three other British Judges and four Palestinian Judges. The Court sits in two capacities: (1) as a Court of Appeal, and as such it has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters decided by the District Courts in first instance, the Land Courts and the Court of Criminal Assize; (2) as a High Court of Justice, in which capacity it hears petitions for habeas corpus, mandamus, etc., and applications which are not within the jurisdiction of any other Court.

The Court of Appeal is composed of two Judges but the Chief Justice may by warrant under his hand constitute a Court of either three or five Judges, while the High Court may not sit with less than two Judges. In each capacity a British Judge presides.

Benches of honorary Magistrates have been established in certain towns to try contraventions for which the maximum penalty does not exceed £P.5 fine or 15 days' imprisonment or both penalties.

Special arrangements exist in the Beersheba sub-district, where minor cases are disposed of according to tribal custom by the Court of Sheikhs. An appeal lies from this Court to the Tribal Court of Appeal which is constituted of the District Officer of Beersheba as President and two Sheikhs chosen by the District Officer who have not sat in the Tribal Court as members.

All matters of personal status affecting Moslems are within the jurisdiction of the Sharia Courts. A Sharia Court consists of a Qadi, and appeals from his decision lie to the Moalem Court of Appeal, which is composed of a President and two members.

Jewish Religious Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters of personal status of Palestinian Jews and jurisdiction by consent with regard to other nationals except in matters of dissolution of marriage. An appeal from the decision of the Jewish Religious Courts lies to the Rabbinical Council.

The different Christian Communities (such as the Orthodox and the Latin), have similar jurisdiction to that of the Jewish Courts.

Questions as to whether a case is one of personal status within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Religious Court shall be referred to a Special Tribunal composed of two British Judges of the Supreme Court and the President of the Highest Court of the Religious Community concerned in Palestine.

Security.

The Police and Prisons establishment in December, 1937, was 190 Officers (including 73 British Officers) and 3,692 other ranks (including 1,121 British N.C.O.s and Constables). 1,598 serious offences against persons and property were reported in 1937 and 2 death sentences were carried out.

There are Central Prisons in Jerusalem and Acre for long-term prisoners, and a Female Prison in Bethlehem. There are also three Jail Labour Companies of approximately 350 each, the prisoners of which are employed on public works.

The normal garrison of Palestine and Trans-Jordan consists of:

Headquarters, British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan (Jerusalem), which administers the following Army, Royal Air Force and Trans-Jordan Force units:

Army:
- Headquarters, British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan.
- Headquarter Troops.
- Headquarters, 14th Infantry Brigade.
- 3 Infantry Battalions.
- Headquarters, 16th Infantry Brigade.
- 3 Infantry Battalions.
- One Field Company, Royal Engineers.
- Detachment, 8th Railway Company, Royal Engineers.

Royal Air Force:
- Headquarters, Royal Air Force in Palestine and Trans-Jordan.
- 2 Squadrons (Day Bomber aircraft).
- 1 Flight (Communication aircraft).
- 1 Company Armoured Cars.
- Meteorological Sections at Amman and Ramleh.
- Combined Supply Depot (R.A.S.C. and Royal Air Force).

Royal Air Force General Hospital, Sarafand.

Trans-Jordan Frontier Force:
- Headquarters.
- 3 Cavalry Squadrons.
- 2 Mechanized Squadrons.

Industry and Trade.

The principal industries of export importance are those of the cultivation of citrus fruits in the Southern District and the district round Haifa; soap-boiling in Nablus, Jaffa and Haifa; wine and brandy making, especially in the Jewish settlements, Zikhron-Ya'acov, Rishon-le-Zion and Petah-Tikvah; olive oil in Nablus, Acre, Haifa and the district round Jaffa. Hosiery, fancy leather goods, and a variety of other articles are exported to Syria and other neighbouring countries. Durrah, lentils, sesame, barley and olive oils are also exported, but this largely depends on favourable climatic conditions.
Oranges and grapefruit are exported to the United Kingdom and Europe, exports during 1937 amounting to 11,903,868 cases valued at £2,418,075. The citrus crop may be expected to increase as many of the plantations are still very young.

Melons are exported mainly to Egypt and Syria.

The principal imports are rice, flour, sugar, petroleum products, textiles, building materials, automobiles, industrial machinery, dairy products, chemical fertilizers and animals for slaughtering.

There is a considerable number of small factories and workshops, including flour mills; factories for soap, brick and tile, knitted goods, textile, artificial teeth, iron and wood furniture, matches; oil mills, cigarettes, fruit juice, edible oils. Of the larger industries, a cement factory produces about 200,000 tons annually. 16 tobacco and cigarette factories produced in 1937 some 14,000 kilos of cut tobacco, 757,000 kilos of cigarettes, 75,000 kilos of tobacca and 9,000 kilos of snuff, and 2,000 kilos of cigars. 15 wine presses and 17 distilleries produced in 1937 some 3,394,000 litres of wine, 365,000 litres of cognac, 59,000 litres of arak and 948,000 litres of other spirits. An oil factory produces several thousand tons of edible oil.

A Brewery commenced production towards the end of 1936. 1,954,786 litres of beer were produced in 1936 and 1,830,245 litres in 1937.

The Hydro-electric Power Station of the Palestine Electric Corporation at Jiar Mejamie now supplies current for light and power to Haifa, Tiberias, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nazareth and many rural centres. The Palestine Electric Corporation has in addition constructed a 18,000 k.w. steam driven station in the Haifa-Acre Bay near Haifa and a larger station is under construction just north of Tel-Aviv. The Jerusalem Electric and Public Service Corporation serves Jerusalem and its environs, including Ramallah and Bethlehem.

Agriculture.

Modern methods are making headway and hold out hopes of development and progress. The country is generally fertile, and cereals, wine, oranges, grapefruit and lemons, olives and various other fruits and vegetables are produced, while sheep and goats thrive in the lowlands and in the mountains.

For the most part the crops are raised without irrigation, except where springs exist and in the eastern portion of the Plain of Esdraelon, and along the citrus belt on the coast.

There are generally two crops harvested each year—the cereal and leguminous crop in May to June and a summer crop in August and September.

The yields of the main crops in 1935 to 1937 were:

| Metric Tons | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 |
|-------------|------|------|------|
| Wheat       | 104,353 | 76,059 | 127,420 |
| Barley      | 68,905 | 55,169 | 75,417 |
| Durra       | 46,135 | 22,122 | 61,023 |
| Lentils     | 2,698 | 2,379 | 3,830 |
| Olives      | 45,092 | 16,755 | 47,247 |
| Citrus Fruits | 1935-6 | 1936-7 | 1937-8 |
| (Exports)   | 5,897,310 | 10,790,110 | 11,415,490 |

An enumeration of livestock was made in July, 1937, according to which there were in Palestine:

- Horses: 20,053
- Mules: 8,989
- Donkeys: 92,205
- Camels: 28,085
- Cattle: 175,209
- Sheep: 209,422
- Goats: 361,424
- Poultry: 2,660,092

Forestry.

During 1937-8, 1,919,000 plants were issued from 10 nurseries maintained by the Department of Forests. Since 1920 planting operations have proceeded on a small scale, and a total of 5,000 acres has been taken in hand. Some 185,000 acres of open land, mainly on rocky hills, but including some areas of sand dunes, have been reserved with a view to eventual afforestation.

Customs.

The Customs Tariff, which is non-differential, is fixed partly on a specific and partly on an ad valorem basis: 65% to 70% of imports pay specific charges, principally petrol, kerosene, sugar, rice, wheat, flour, leaf tobacco, cigarettes, wood and timber for building and furniture, rubber tyres and tubes, boots and shoes, motor cars, silk tissues, cotton piece goods. Ad valorem duties at varying rates are levied on other goods.

The revenue from import duties in 1937 was £2,133,190.

15-84% of imports came from the United Kingdom, 4-60% from other parts of the British Empire, 8-64% from Syria, 16-53% from Germany, 6-91% from U.S.A., 8-63% from Roumania, 3-11% from Belgium and 3-11% from Japan.

Exports to the United Kingdom constituted 54-19% of the total exports in 1937, to other parts of the British Empire 1-82%, to Germany 1-82%, to Syria 10-75%, to Egypt 1-71%, and to Holland 5-59%.

Shipping and Communications.

The chief ports of Palestine are Haifa and Jaffa (which includes Tel-Aviv Jetty and Lighter Basin). The harbour at Haifa, started in 1929 and completed in 1933, provides adequate facilities for ordinary passenger and cargo vessels both at moorings and alongside the new quays, with transit sheds, road, railway and other services. The Lighter Harbour, which was constructed in 1936, at the northern end of Jaffa Port, 3½ miles from Jaffa Lighter Basin, to serve the needs of Tel-Aviv, was considerably extended during 1937, and further improvements are contemplated.

Acre and Gaza are also ports of entry, but their trade is small and is carried mainly by sailing vessels.

The following are the principal shipping lines which call at Haifa and Jaffa:

- Khedivial Mail Line, Adriatica S.A. (Soc. Venetia di Navigazione, Adriatica S.A., Lloyd Triestino), Messageries Maritimes, Royal Netherland Steamahip Co., Prince Line, Ellerman & Papayani, Moss Hutchison Line, Anglo Saxon Petroleum Co., Deutsche Levant Line, Svenska Orient Line, American Export Line, Arment Deppe Line, United Levant Lines, Hellenic Coast Line, Service Maritime Rumain, Ellerman Wilson Line, Polish Palestine Line, Lauritzen Line, Orient Line, Atid Navigation Co., Société Commerciale Bulgare, Palestine Maritime Lloyd, Westcott & Laurence Line, Yugoslavenski Lloyd, Black Sea State Steamahip Line.

In 1937, 1,992 steamers, totalling 4,817,829 tons, and 1,545 sailing vessels, totalling 44,291 tons, called at Palestine ports in the foreign trade.

Two cargo steam vessels and one cargo motor vessel fly the Palestinian flag.

Postal despatches are exchanged daily (in some cases seven times daily) between all principal towns. There is also a daily exchange of despatches with Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan. Direct mails for Great Britain are despatched four times weekly by ordinary mail and five times weekly by air mail. An air mail is despatched daily to Egypt and Iraq.
There is a twice-weekly overland desert mail service with Iraq and Persia, on Monday via Haifa and Nafrafk and on Thursday via Jerusalem and Amman.

Imperial Airways use the Government Airport at Lydda in connection with the air mail services to and from Great Britain, Iraq, India, Australia, and beyond.

All the principal towns are connected by telegraph and telephone. There is direct telegraphic communication with Cyprus, Egypt, Syria and Trans-Jordan, and a trunk service with Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Trans-Jordan. The trunk service with Egypt affords radio-telephonic facilities with Great Britain and with all other countries connected thereto.

In 1937 there were conveyed 33,068,000 letters, 3,300,900 postcards, 21,371,100 printed communications and samples, 197,286 parcels, and 406,992 telegrams were transmitted. Total length of main telegraph and telephone lines, 19,104 kilometres; local lines, 70,858 kilometres. Number of telephone subscribers 8,417; telephone instruments in use 14,848.

The total length of the Palestine Railways, including branch lines and sidings, is approximately 728½ miles, as follows:

| Standard Gauge (4' 8½") |
|-------------------------|
| El Kantara–Rafah        | 138½ |
| Rafah–Haifa             | 198  |
| Jaffa–Jerusalem         | 60   |
| Es Safriya–Sarafand     | 3    |

| Haifa (Kilo 2) to Acre  | 15½  |
| Nablus–Tulkarm          | 25   |

728½

The El Kantara–Rafah Section is operated by the Palestine Railways on behalf of His Majesty's Government.

There is through communication with Egypt, and trains connect at El Kantara West with Cairo, Alexandria, Port Said, Suez and other parts of Egypt. Goods vehicles are sent across the canal by means of a truck transporter.

Sentinel–Cammell Steam Rail Cars are in use on the Lydda–Khan Yunis, Haifa–Acre and Haifa–Samakh Sections.

East of Haifa the Palestine Railways Administration extends to Ma'an in Trans-Jordan, but with a break between Samakh and Nassib which is operated by the Chemins de Fer du Hedjaz authorities.

There are (1937) 878 miles of roads in Palestine suitable for motor traffic in all weather and in addition over a thousand miles of seasonal track passable for wheel traffic of all kinds.

Banking, Co-operative and Currency.

The most important bank in Palestine is Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Haifa, Nablus, Nazareth, and agencies at Acre, Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road North (Tel-Aviv), Ramat Gan, Gaza and Hebron. The Anglo-Palestine Bank has its head office in Palestine at Tel-Aviv with branches at Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa, Tiberias, Safad, Petah-Tiqvah, Hadera, Rehovoth and agencies at Hadar Hacarmel, Allenby Road (Tel-Aviv), North Branch (Tel-Aviv). Affiliated with the Anglo-Palestine Bank is the General Mortgage Bank of Palestine, with head office at Tel-Aviv, which grants mortgage loans on houses. In addition there are branches in Jerusalem of the Ottoman Bank (also in Haifa, Jaffa, Tel-Aviv, Nablus and Amman), the Banco di Roma (also in Jaffa, Haifa, Tel-Aviv, and an agency in Jerusalem), the Holland Bank Union at Haifa, and the Polish Guardian Bank Ltd. in Tel-Aviv and Haifa. There are also the Workers' Bank Ltd., the Zerbabel Bank at Tel-Aviv and the Central Bank of Co-operative Societies at Jerusalem, which grant credit to co-operative societies.

The co-operative movement is extensively established among the Jewish population, both urban and rural. There is a Registrar of Co-operative Societies whose duties include the encouragement of the growth of a similar movement among the Arab farmers. At the request of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, about 95 Jewish Credit Societies have made regular monthly statements of their assets and liabilities as at the end of each month since April, 1936. At the end of August, 1938, the aggregate amount of the deposits held by 105 Jewish Credit Co-operative Societies amounted to £P.2,944,163, while the amount of credit granted to their members in the form of advances and/or bills discounted amounted to £P.3,402,753.

Following the appointment of the Examiner of Banks, the Banking Ordinance was amended in 1936. Accordingly all banks (foreign and local) are required to submit monthly statements of their assets and liabilities as at the end of each month. Summary statements showing the aggregated figures of commercial banks are published monthly by the Office of Statistics, Jerusalem. On the 31st August, 1938, the aggregate amount of time and demand deposits held by the 6 foreign banks and the 37 local banks amounted to £P.14,194,552, while the total amount of credit granted by these institutions in the form of advances and/or bills discounted amounted to £P.9,920,940.

A Currency Board was appointed in London in 1926 in order to introduce and control a Palestine currency based on the pound sterling; and the new currency was issued on the 1st November, 1927, under the authority of an Order of His Majesty in Council dated the 7th of February, 1927.

The standard of currency is the Palestine pound, divided into 1,000 mils. The Palestine Currency Order provides for a gold coin of one Palestine pound containing 123.27447 grains of standard gold (the equivalent of the English sovereign). It is not intended at present to introduce gold coins. The Currency Board has issued silver coins of 100 and 50 mils, nickel bronze coins of 20, 10 and 5 mils, bronze coins of 2 and 1 mils, and currency notes of £P.100, £P.50, £P.10, £P.5, £P.1 and 500 mils. The currency notes are legal tender for the amounts expressed therein. Silver coins are legal tender for the payment of £P.2, nickel bronze coins of 20 and 10 mils are legal tender for the payment of an amount not exceeding 200 mils, and coins of lower denomination are legal tender for an amount not exceeding 100 mils. The amount of Palestine currency in circulation at the 31st August, 1938, was:—Coins, £P.491,800; notes, £P.4,382,334.

The metric system is followed by the Government and local authorities, but the use of local weights and measures is still permitted for the general public.

Antiquities.

The administration of the Antiquities Service in Palestine is controlled by the Department of Antiquities, working under the Antiquities Ordinance
and Regulations (1929-32). During 1937, fourteen licences to excavate or make soundings were issued. The results of the Department's research work, together with summaries of the results of licensed excavations conducted by non-Government bodies, are published in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine. (Published by Sir Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, London, E.C.4.)

The Department of Antiquities is housed in a building known as the Palestine Archaeological Museum, the construction and equipment of which were made possible by funds contributed by Mr. John D. Rockefeller.

For further information on all the above subjects see the "Handbook of Palestine" (Luke, H. C., and Keith-Roach, E.), published in 1930 by Macmillan and Co., and issued under the authority of the Government of Palestine, the Annual Blue Books of the Palestine Government, obtainable from the Government Printer, Jerusalem, and the Annual Reports on the Administration of Palestine and Trans-Jordan, published by His Majesty's Stationery Office. The Report of the Royal Commission on Palestine, together with the volume of Memoranda prepared by the Government of Palestine for the Royal Commission and the Minutes of Evidence heard at the public sessions of the Royal Commission, may also be consulted. The publication of an annual Statistical Abstract of Palestine, obtainable from the Crown Agents for the Colonies, commenced with the 1936 issue.
