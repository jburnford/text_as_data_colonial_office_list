UGANDA.

(For Map see under Kenya.)

Extent and Boundaries.

The British Protectorate over Buganda was proclaimed on August 27th, 1894. The Protectorate was further extended over Bunyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Buganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth as follows:

On the east by Kenya Colony as far north as Mount Zulia, near the 4th degree of north latitude, the natural boundaries being the Turkana escarpment, Mount Elgon, and the Sio River running into the north-east corner of Lake Victoria; on the south, by the Tanganyika Territory and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the frontier of the Belgian Congo, the natural boundaries being Lake Edward, Mt. Ruwenzori, the Semliki River, Lake Albert and the Nile watershed; and on the north, by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

The area of the Uganda Protectorate is estimated at 93,981 square miles, including 13,680 square miles of water. Pending the complete survey of the country, it is not possible to give the correct area.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate is divided into three provinces (Eastern, Western, and Buganda), and then again into numerous districts.

The headquarters of the Uganda administration are at Entebbe, and the chief commercial towns in the Protectorate are Kampala and Jinja; all three are on or near the North shore of Lake Victoria.

Climate.

The climate, when compared with that of some tropical countries, is not unpleasant, but there are parts of the country which can by no means be called healthy. The conditions vary with the altitude in different parts of the Protectorate: the Nile Valley, which lies about 2,000 feet above sea-level, is hot, and is considerably more unhealthy than the higher-lying regions between Lakes Victoria and Albert. The most congenial climate for European residence is found in the Buganda kingdom and in the Western Province, where in some districts the altitude exceeds 5,000 feet above sea-level. European children thrive well in infancy in a few of the healthier stations, but considerable risk is attached to bringing them out when over six or seven years old, as they are always liable to attacks of malaria and the anemia and general ill-health resulting therefrom.

The climate is mild, neither excessively hot nor cold, the average temperature for the year 1937 at Entebbe being—Mean maximum, 77°9 Fahrenheit; mean minimum, 63°3 Fahrenheit. Average daily sunshine 6·3 hours.

The lowest rainfall for 1937 was recorded at Mwirasandu (Western Province), which registered 29·33 inches, the highest (128·75) being recorded at Kalangala (Sesse Islands).

The seasons are not well defined, but there are two dry seasons within the year; one dry season usually includes June and July, and the other December, January and February.

The healthiest months of the year are usually January, February and March, July, August, September and October, and the least healthy, April, May, November and December, or the periods corresponding to those immediately following the rains, when the mosquitoes become more in evidence and malarial infections more numerous.
No part of the Protectorate can be said to be absolutely free from malaria, but in some districts, for example those of Toro and Kigezi in the Western Province, there is comparatively little, while on the other hand, in the Nile valley and along the courses of the larger rivers, malaria prevails at all seasons of the year.

Sleeping sickness, which proved such a scourge to the country in 1902 and the years following and necessitated the evacuation of the natives from the islands in Lake Victoria, and from the shores of the great lakes and rivers, is now well under control. During 1921 and 1922 the island population was to a great extent restored and many of the islands were successfully reopened. The focus of the disease is no longer on Lake Victoria.

Plague and smallpox are unfortunately endemic in the native population, but it has been possible to confine outbreaks for the most part within narrow limits. Active measures against these diseases are constantly engaging the attention of the medical and administrative authorities.

History.

The countries that now make up the Uganda Protectorate did not become known to Europe until the journey of Speke and Grant in search of the sources of the Nile, which brought them to Buganda in 1862 and to Bunyoro a year later. In both countries they found a somewhat advanced indigenous civilization, and it is around the rivalries of these two principalities that all the early history of the country centres. The Swahili form of "Buganda," the country of the Baganda people, has been adopted as the name of the whole Protectorate, although there are many other quite separate races and tribes among its inhabitants. Speke's discoveries were not at first credited, but were soon confirmed by Sir Samuel Baker and his wife who discovered Lake Albert. The first missionaries arrived in Buganda in 1877, and the rivalries of Protestant, Catholic and Mohammedan which soon naturally arose ended, after the death of the old king, Mutesa, and the accession of his weak and vacillating son, Mwanga, to the throne in 1884, in bloodshed. The Imperial British East Africa Company which, after concluding a treaty with Mwanga in 1890, had occupied Kampala with a weak force under Capt. Lugard, had much difficulty in trying to compose these rivalries, and would have been forced to abandon the country but for the intervention of the British Government, which sent out a Special Commissioner, Sir Gerald Portal, in 1893. His enquiry and negotiations led to the establishment of the Protectorate in the following year. For three years the country remained quiet, but in 1897 mutiny broke out among some of the Sudanese troops who had been recruited by the Company from the remains of the Egyptian forces cut off by the Mahdist rebellion. It soon spread to all the discontented elements, but was ultimately overcome after having seriously menaced British rule. Finally the two kings—Mwanga of Buganda and Kabarega of Bunyoro—who had always resented European penetration and had seized upon the mutiny as a good opportunity to put an end to it, were captured and deported.

Since then there is little but peaceful progress to record. Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government in 1900 as Special Commissioner to settle the country, and concluded agreements with the heads of the native principalities of Buganda, Toro and Ankole, which laid down the principles governing their administrative relations with the Crown and the ownership of the land. No such arrangements could be made at the time with regard to the rest of the present Protectorate, but administration has since been extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganised tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" have been followed wherever and whenever it was possible as in the "agreement districts." In 1903 the Eastern highlands of the Protectorate along with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony, and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of frontiers with the Sudan, the Belgian Congo, and German East Africa, now the Tanganyika Territory. In 1903 the superintendence of the Protectorates affairs passed from the Foreign to the Colonial Office. In the Great War the population, of all races, remained devotedly loyal and played a great part in the East African campaign. Since then progress, both material and cultural, has continued, the former made possible by the success of the cotton industry and the development of communications, the latter based on the activities of the missions, both Protestant and Catholic, in whose hands was all educational work until 1925.

Constitution.

By the Uganda Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council both consisting of such persons as may be directed by Royal Instructions. Under the Royal Instructions dated the 5th June, 1920, as amended by subsequent instructions, the Executive Council consists of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture, Director of Education, and the Resident Commissioner, Buganda (ex-officio members), and such other persons holding office in the public service as the Governor may appoint (official members), and such other persons (if any) not holding such office as the Governor may appoint (unofficial members), with the Governor as President.

It is further provided that the Legislative Council shall consist of the Governor, Attorney-General, Financial Secretary, Director of Medical Services, Director of Agriculture and Director of Education (ex-officio members), with official and unofficial members as in the case of the Executive Council. There are at present four unofficial members and no official member.

For the East African Governors Conference, see under Kenya.

The Native Government of Buganda has certain rights of internal legislation granted by agreement. The king, or Kabaka, who is accorded the title of "His Highness," rules the Baganda people with the advice of the Governor and of a native Council known as the Lukiko, which also has judicial functions.

Communications.

The Uganda Protectorate is separated by about 500 miles from the nearest point on the east coast of Africa. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the Colony of Kenya, transport was exceedingly difficult before the construction of the "Uganda Railway" from Mombasa to the northeast corner of Lake Victoria, which the Imperial Government decided in 1895 to undertake. This railway at the end of 1901 had covered the whole 684 miles separating Mombasa from Kisumu on Victoria Nyanza, which was the terminus of the railway until recent years.
There is a Lake Steamer Service connecting Entebbe, Port Bell (Kampala), and Jinja with Kisumu and the other ports on Lake Victoria. Steamers ply also on Lake Kioga and on Lake Albert and the Albert Nile as far North as Nimule. All these services are maintained by the Kenya and Uganda Railways and Harbours Administration.

A railway, 62 miles long, from Jinja to Namasagali on the Victoria Nile, giving access to the waterways of Lake Kioga, was completed in 1912, and one from Port Bell on Lake Victoria to Kampala, the principal commercial centre, a distance of 73 miles, was opened for public traffic in 1915.

Since the Great War considerable railway development has taken place, and the main line of the Kenya and Uganda Railway, leaving the original line at Nakuru, now extends into the Eastern Province of Uganda to join the Jinja-Namasagali railway at Mbulamuti, and so places Uganda in direct communication with the Coast. An extension of this line from Tororo, near the Kenya border, to Mbale and Soroti was completed in 1929, and the linking up of Jinja with Kampala—a scheme which involved the bridging of the Victoria Nile at the former place—was completed in the early part of 1931.

The system of all-weather main roads radiating from Kampala to the principal administrative centres is maintained by the Public Works Department, which has a road mileage of 2,075 under its control. A system of roads in the Western Province establishes connection between the tin-mines and the Kagera River steamship service, taps the resources of the Ruchuru area of the Belgian Congo for that service, and links up direct the district headquarters in the west of the Protectorate. About 5,324 miles of excellent roads are also kept up by the Native Administrations. Motor-transport, in consequence of these facilities, has reached an advanced stage of development in the Protectorate.

The Uganda Posts and Telegraphs Department is amalgamated with those of Kenya and Tanganyika under the control of the Postmaster-General at Nairobi.

Uganda is now in telegraphic communication with Mombasa and Dar-es-Salam by land lines, and thence by cable with Great Britain and other countries and also by wireless to Great Britain through Nairobi. All important centres within the Protectorate are also connected by telegraph.

The total mileage of telegraph and telephone pole route at the end of 1937 was 1,574, and the wire mileage 5,156. Telephone exchanges are worked at Entebbe, Kampala, Jinja, Inganga, Busambatia, Mbale, Tororo, Bombo, Mpigi, Busia and Masaka, and connected by trunk lines.

Aviation.

Landing grounds are kept up at Kololo (Kampala), Entebbe, Tororo, Masindi, Gulu, Mbarara and Jinja, Lira, Butiaba, Arua and Moroto. Landing facilities for sea-planes exist at Entebbe, Port Bell, Jinja and Butiaba. There is no accommodation in Uganda for housing aircraft, but repairs can be carried out at the above places. Tri-weekly communication by air with Europe and South Africa, has now been established by means of Imperial Airways, Ltd.

Industries.

Coffee of the Arabica and Robusta varieties has been introduced and thrives exceedingly well; the former is the principal crop on European plantations, and both are being grown in increasing quantities by Africans. The principal industry is cotton, and 1,353,568 centsals of lint, valued at 4,269,283l., as well as 103,440 tons of cotton seed, of a value of 392,083l., were exported in 1937. Sugar, hides and skins, ground-nuts and chillies, are the other principal agricultural exports, and, except for sugar, practically all the production is in native hands. Mineral discoveries have been made in recent years, and there is a considerable export of high-grade tin ore from the Western Province. 19,590 ozs. (troy) of gold, valued at 124,713l., was also exported in 1937. Cattle are plentiful. Leasehold grants of land can be obtained from the government, but the issue of freehold concessions has been withdrawn for the present.

The weights and measures in common use in the Protectorate are the Imperial weights and measures. The currency is the same as that of Kenya.

Banking facilities are afforded by the National Bank of India Ltd., with branches at Entebbe, Kampala, and Jinja, the Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd., with branches at Kampala and Jinja, by Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas), with branches at Kampala and Jinja, and the Merchant's Bank at Kampala.

Trade and Customs.

Since 1917 Kenya and Uganda have been one administrative unit for purposes of Customs.

A uniform Tariff was adopted in 1923 for Kenya and Uganda, operating also in Tanganyika Territory. Under this tariff all export duties were abolished and the import schedules were remodelled to provide for the imposition of "specific" duties and of "ad valorem" duties varying from 10% to 62½% of the landed value of goods liable to duty on importation. In addition, free trade between Kenya, Uganda and the Tanganyika Territory in goods, the growth, produce or manufacture of each of the territories was established. The 1923 Tariff with minor alterations, remained in force until April, 1930, advantage of the existence of a tariff common to the three territories being taken to institute in August, 1927, a system of extending unrestricted trading to imported goods passing between the territories. Under this procedure, which is operated by means of transfer forms, single payment of duty only is chargeable, the Customs Revenue involved being credited to the consuming territory by inter-departmental entry.

In 1930 a uniform modernised Tariff scheduled according to commodities as opposed to rates was negotiated and enacted in the three territories simultaneously. Included in the provisions of the Tariff Ordinance is an amended definition of value for purposes of assessment of duty which brings the East Africa Tariff Laws into conformity with the practice followed in many other countries and allows of the acceptance of certificates of value endorsed on invoices in the stereotyped form approved by the Imperial Customs Conference, 1921.

The basis of assessment is now the current domestic value in the country of export plus freight and other charges incurred up to the time of importation of goods into Kenya, Uganda or the Tanganyika Territory as the case may be. As regards certain specially protected commodities (wheat, flour, sugar, timber, etc.), the device of "suspended duties" has been adopted in order to allow of a defined margin of elasticity in each territory in the matter of imposition on specified articles of "suspended duties" as distinct from basic duties, without interference with the main principle of a common Tariff. The 1930 Tariff Ordinances of the three territories produce that the Governor, with the approval of Legislative Council, may impose by Proclamation either in part or in full a duty referred to in the Tariff schedules as a "suspended duty," the effect being that each Government has the right to vary "suspended duties" up to the amount specified in the Tariff. At the same time an undertaking has been given by each Government that removals of any of the
"Suspended duties" will only take place after prior consultation with the other Governments concerned.

In 1931 the Consumption Tax previously leviable on wines and spirits cleared for consumption in Kenya was incorporated in the common Tariff and certain increases in the rates of duty chargeable on vehicles and parts (including tyres and tubes) were imposed in the three territories.

The import tariff as it now stands admits free of duty goods essential to the agricultural, industrial, educational and scientific development of the territories and has been designed, as far as possible, to protect imports essential to the opening up and development of the country and to foster local production of agricultural and other commodities in which Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika Territory, taken as an economic unit, are, or can be made, self-supporting.

The net amount of Customs receipts credited to Uganda from all sources was £67,0754 in 1937.

Finances.

The Revenue is principally derived from poll taxes, customs duties, cotton tax, trading licences, and land rents. The revenue from poll taxes in 1937 was £10,170L., and from customs duties £67,075L. There has been no grant-in-aid from the British Government since 1914-15. The Uganda Loan, 1932 (£2,110,060), was floated in January, 1932. The unit of currency is the East African shilling.
