MALTA, G.C.

Area

The total area is 122 square miles made up of the three main islands as follows: Malta 94·876 square miles, Gozo 25·899 square miles and Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are mere islets.

Population

On 31st December, 1956, the population, which is European, was estimated at 316,239, divided as follows: Malta 288,453, Gozo and Comino 27,786. Malta is overpopulated, and it is the policy of the Government to encourage and assist emigration. From 1946 to 1955 53,211 persons emigrated; the figure for 1956 was 4,104, of whom 2,591 went to Australia. The United Kingdom Government has undertaken to meet two-thirds of expenditure on emigration. For the financial year 1956–57 the contribution of the United Kingdom Government was £103,574 of which £1,350 was in respect of 1955–56.

Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1956 was 34° F. recorded on the 18th March, while the highest, 108° F., occurred on the 16th June. The mean annual temperature is 66° F. and the mean annual rainfall is 21 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind which blows from the southeast.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12th June, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the
help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

**Constitution**

Letters Patent granting self-government to the Island came into force in 1947. They provide for a Legislative Assembly of forty members, elected by universal suffrage by proportional representation. The Legislative Assembly passes Bills for "the peace, order and good government of Malta", subject to certain limitations regarding "reserved matters". The Ministry consists of the Prime Minister and not more than seven other Ministers. The Executive Council consists of the Cabinet presided over by the Governor. Legislative and administrative powers in regard to defence and various matters related or incidental to defence and external relations, are reserved to the Governor, advised by the Nominated Council, which consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, the Legal Secretary and three officers (one each from the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force). The Privy Council consists of the Executive Council and the Nominated Council sitting together, and affords an opportunity for joint consultation in matters in which action proposed to be taken by one side of the dyarchy may affect the other side.

The English language and the Maltese language are the official languages of Malta.

**Land Policy**

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese, but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

**Taxation**

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties, and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £200.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £300.
- 4s. 6d. for every pound of the next £400.
- 6s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

The tax on companies is at the rate of 5s. on every pound of the chargeable income.

A surtax is also levied on incomes exceeding £2,500 at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £500.
- 2s. 6d. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

The funds of the "Massa Frumentaria" were in 1798 appropriated by the French Government then in occupation of the Island.

By the Temporary Borrowing Act, 1951, the Government was enabled to borrow an amount up to a maximum of £500,000 by way of an overdraft on the Public Account in order to meet the cost of consignments of wheat and other essential commodities imported by the Government. The Act, which provided for the repayment of any sum borrowed not later than 31st March, 1953, has now lapsed.

Under the Malta Treasury Bills Act, 1952, the Government may, whenever authorized by Resolution of the Legislative Assembly, raise
money not exceeding the amount specified in such Resolution by means of three months' Treasury Bills. On 31st March, 1957, the amount so raised was £750,000.

Communications

The international airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station, but there are other airfields at Hal Far and Ta Qali. British European Airways operate the following services: (a) three services daily to London via Ajaccio or Naples and/or Rome and/or Nice; (b) two services a week to Catania; (c) two services a week to Tripoli, and (d) two services a week to Tripoli and Benghazi.

During 1956, 4,889 aircraft off-loaded 24,682 passengers while 4,894 aircraft took off 25,041 passengers; 45,587 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of the Island does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Five miles of road have so far been surfaced with sheet asphalt and 407 miles with full grouting, semi-grouting and surface asphalt dressing including three miles of bitmac.

The chief port is the Grand Harbour, which in 1956 handled 1,662 steamships of a total tonnage of 2,729,749 and 135 sailing vessels with a total of 9,015 tons. There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a service calling at Naples, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Malta and Tripoli, every five days. A ferry service running between Marfa and Mgarr links the two Islands of Malta and Gozo.

Broadcasting

There are no broadcasting stations in Malta. The number of licences for wireless receiving sets on 31st July, 1957, was, however, 13,913. Messrs. Broadcast Relay Service (Malta) Limited operate a wired broadcasting station situated at Hamrun. The number of subscribers is 44,885.

Principal Occupations

The gainfully-occupied population (82,950) was engaged in 1956 in the following occupations: agriculture (7,490), fishing (840), stone quarrying and clay pits (680), manufacturing and mechanical (8,600) construction (4,250), commerce (10,150), communications (3,830), community, recreation and personal services (7,140), Government (16,320), dockyard and Service Departments, including local servicemen (23,670).

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are potatoes, vegetables, grapes, wheat, barley and forages. Fresh vegetables and potatoes are the main cash crops. In 1955-56 32,490 tons of potatoes and 27,951 tons of vegetables were produced.

The livestock population in 1956 was:— cattle 9,142; horses 2,151; donkeys 2,973; mules 2,026; sheep 16,721; goats 43,993; pigs 15,173.

During 1956 16,775 cwt. of fish were landed by local fishermen (mainly during the months between May and November) with a wholesale value of £135,720.

There are no known mineral resources and no forests in Malta and raw materials have nearly all to be imported.

There are no heavy industries in the islands, but a growing number of light industries produce macaroni, canned fruits, flour, tomato-paste, beer, wine, squashes and soft drinks, cigars and cigarettes, smokers' pipes and accessories, matches, pyjamas and shirts, edible oil, leather and plastic footwear, handbags and suitcases, furniture, cement tiles, marble works, bituminous emulsions, basket ware, candles, crown corks, gloves, mirrors, homespun cloth, buttons and tanned leather, lace, gold and silver filigree work, hosiery, nails and screws, and textiles.

The Government currently grants exclusive right to produce goods under the provisions of the Encouragement of New Industries Act.

This Act is being replaced shortly by a comprehensive New Aids to Industry Act intended to encourage the setting up of new industries and the expansion of existing ones. Such incentives as transfer of machinery grants, exemption from income tax for a period of years, grants and loans by the Government and exemption from duty on raw materials and plant are being considered. A Trading Estate near the harbour is also contemplated.
