THE GAMBIA

Area

The total area is 4,003 square miles (Colony 29 square miles, Protectorate 3,974 square miles). St. Mary's Island, with an area of about 2,500 acres of dry land, is included in the Colony area.

Population

The total population (1956 estimate), is 275,100, composed as follows:

- Colony—Bathurst—21,000; Kombo St. Mary—7,800; Protectorate—246,300. There are also about 9,600 seasonal immigrants. The population of Bathurst is African except for a few hundred Europeans, Syrians and Lebanese. The main tribal groups in the Protectorate are:

| Approximate Nos. |
|------------------|
| Mandingo         | 103,000 |
| Fula (all tribal subdivisions) | 57,000 |
| Wolof            | 36,000 |
| Serahuli         | 20,000 |
| Jola             | 21,000 |
| Others (of less than 5,000 each) | 10,000 |

The Principal Towns are—

**Colony**
- Bathurst—capital; population 21,000.

**Protectorate**
- Western Division—Brikama.
- Central Division—Mansa Konko.
- MacCarthy Island Division—Georgetown.
- Upper River Division—Basse.

Population in the Protectorate is evenly distributed and there are no towns of over 3,000 inhabitants.

Geographical Features

The River Gambia, some 700 miles in length, flows into the Atlantic by a wide estuary which narrows to two and a half miles between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 27 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 16 feet can at present proceed without trouble to Kuntaur 150 miles up-river. There is no bar to the River Gambia. The Colony consists mainly of the Island of St. Mary, at the mouth of the River Gambia, the adjoining division of Kombo St. Mary and MacCarthy Island in the middle river. The Protectorate consists of strips of territory on either bank of the river, for most of their length no more than seven miles wide.

Climate

The Gambia has a long dry season, normally from November to May, which is pleasant with its low temperature and humidity, due to the effect of the harmattan. Rainfall is confined to the period from June to October and averages about 40 inches on the coast, decreasing inland. The dry season climate near the coast is better than in most places in British West Africa, with the exception, perhaps, of the Cameroons highlands. During the wet season, however, humidity increases and is higher on the coast. Up-river it is much hotter but less humid, especially during the period February to May, after which the heat gradually decreases, with a rapid increase of humidity.

History

The Gambia was discovered by the Portuguese in 1455 but they made no lasting settlement. Between 1588 and 1752 Royal Charters were granted to various English merchants to trade with it. French merchants also plied during that period but the right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. From 1807 to 1816 the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off, in part due to the abolition of the slave trade. In 1816 a new settlement was founded on the Island of Banjul by English merchants from Senegal. Banjul was renamed St. Mary's and its town named after Lord Bathurst the then Secretary of State.

The settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone and was annexed to that Colony by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a Military Commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court", administered the Government. From 1822 to 1829 the Commandant governed alone.

In December 1829, the Secretary of State appointed the first Lieutenant Governor "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia". The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

The Gambia in the year 1843 was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs.

By the charter of 1866 it became a portion of the West African Settlements and continued to be so under the charter of 1874, until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions of 1840, 1850 and 1853. In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection. Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894 and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. This ordinance has since been superseded by the Protectorate Ordinance, 1935. There is a Commissioner in charge of each Division and each District is under a District Head Chief.

Constitution

Following recommendations approved by the Secretary of State in 1953 a new constitution for the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia was introduced in September 1954.

Under the Gambia (Constitution) Order in Council, 1954, the provisions of which apply both to the Colony and to the Protectorate, the Executive Council consists of four ex officio Members, one Official Member, and not less than six Appointed Members. The Executive Council thus has, for the first time, an unofficial majority. Of the Appointed Members, all of whom must be Elected or Nominated Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council, two have been appointed Ministers and assigned special responsibilities for:

(a) the submission to Executive Council of questions relating to matters within their respective portfolios,

(b) ensuring, in association with the appropriate public officer, that effect is given to decisions taken by the Governor in Executive Council relating to these matters, and

(c) conducting in the Legislative Council government business relating to matters within their respective portfolios.

The Governor attends and presides at meetings of the Executive Council: with certain specified exceptions the Governor is required to consult the Executive Council in the exercise of his powers, but may act in opposition to their advice if he deems it right so to do.

The Legislative Council, which met for the first time under the new constitution in December 1954, consists of a Speaker, four ex officio Members, one Nominated Official Member, two Nominated Unofficial Members, and fourteen Elected Members of whom four are directly elected to represent Bathurst and Kombo St. Mary, seven are indirectly elected to represent the Protectorate, and the remaining three are indirectly elected from a panel of names submitted by the Bathurst and Kombo St. Mary municipal councils. Meetings of the Council are normally presided over by the Speaker, but the Governor retains the right to attend any meeting and preside thereat. The usual legislative powers of the Council are subject to the Governor's reserve powers to legislate by declaration if he considers it expedient so to do in the interests of public order, public faith or good government.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized in the Colony and there is no restriction on the acquisition of land by non-natives. Freehold interests in Crown lands are not disposed of except in special circumstances and with the sanction of the Secretary of State. A grant of Crown lands for a term of years may be made by the Governor. The normal term is 21 years with an option of renewal for a like term.

Land in the Protectorate is held on native customary tenure from the Native Authority for the district in which it is vested. In general, land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 21 years. Leases of small plots suitable for commercial or industrial purposes may be obtained from the Native Authority for the district, with the approval of the Governor. The power to approve is delegated to the Senior Commissioner.

Taxation

There is a sliding scale of personal income tax which amounts to the following rates on chargeable incomes (incomes of single persons up to
£200 a year and married persons up to £350 a year are free of tax, and there are additional allowances for dependants:

| Chargeable income | Average rate of tax in the £ |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| £400              | 1s. 6d.                       |
| £400              | 2s. 6d.                       |
| £1,100            | 5s. 0d.                       |
| £8,000            | 10s. 0d.                      |
| £10,300           | 15s. 0d.                      |

The Company rate is 9s. in the £. There is no estate duty.

There is a direct tax on inhabitants of the Protectorate known as the District Rate which accrues to the District Treasuries. The rate at present is 30s. per "yard" of not more than four houses. There are additional rates for lodgers in the "yard" and "strange farmers".

The other main form of taxation is the Customs tariff.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 166,794     | 263,199         |
| 1952 | 1,431,495   | 1,424,213       |
| 1953 | 1,201,068   | 1,085,693       |
| 1954 | 1,420,356   | 1,168,309       |
| 1955 | 1,493,146   | 1,423,310       |
| 1956 | 1,405,007   | 1,646,900       |

The estimated main heads of revenue in 1957 were:

Customs £883,250, Direct Taxation £205,000 and Colonial Development and Welfare Act and other Grants £377,506.

In the same year the estimated main heads of expenditure were:

Departmental Services £1,545,674, Development £269,295, Public Works Extraordinary £134,597.

The Public Debt of the Gambia at the end of December 1956 amounted to £238,760, approximately 17s. 4d. per head of population (Gambia 3½ Stock 1963). The Sinking Fund as at 31st December, 1956 amounted to £50,599.

### Currency.

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; bronze coins of 1d., and ½d. and nickel coins of one-tenth penny. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

### Development Plans

A total of £1,300,000 was originally made available under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Of this sum £800,000 was for services (medical, agricultural, veterinary and educational) including capital expenditure on buildings and plant; £500,000 was for the development of Bathurst and the Kombo.

The major capital works which will remain as monuments of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 are:

(i) A new hospital in Bathurst.
(ii) A new town drainage system.
(iii) 400 acres of adjacent reclaimed land which was formerly swamp.
(iv) A new urban water supply.
(v) New schools.
(vi) New health centres and rural dispensaries.
(vii) New veterinary headquarters.
(viii) New paved streets in Bathurst.
(ix) New quarters for meteorological and airport staff.

Other schemes include research into pest infestation, veterinary and agricultural improvement, the Gambia Rice Farm, experimental work on bilharzia and sociological research.

Gambia's initial territorial allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955 was £200,000. Its unspent balance from the previous development was approximately £600,000. If therefore had a total territorial allocation for 1955-60 of approximately £800,000, to which has been added the sum of £50,000 made as a supplementary allocation in 1957.

A programme of further development schemes for the Gambia within the funds now made available has been approved and provides for the continuation of schemes now under way and for new schemes, including a road bridge connecting the Island of St. Mary with the mainland, and extensive improvements to Armitage School at Georgetown in the Protectorate. Total Colonial Development and Welfare Act expenditure in 1958 will be approximately £150,000.

### Other Development

A "Farmers' Fund" has been established from the profits of the Oilseeds Marketing Board. Besides meeting all the expenses of employing six Development Officers, it has enabled a number of schemes, chiefly of an agricultural nature, to be started. These schemes include expenditure in the opening up of new rice lands, fishing, poultry, tsetse control, communal gardens, group farming, introduction of timber-sawing by hand, and animal pest (baboon, monkey and pig) control.

A programme of construction and improvement to rural water supplies is in hand comprising concrete-lined wells with hand pumps, washing slabs and cattle watering troughs; also the construction of three new major wharves to serve towns in the lower river previously without suitable wharfage. Both schemes are financed by the Farmers' Fund. The Fund is also participating, with Government, on an equal share basis, in the cost of reconstructing 26 other major river wharves, over the next six years, and with Local Authorities in the reconstruction of swamp causeway roads to a number of these wharves in the Middle River.

### Education

Government is responsible for primary education in Bathurst; most schools have a religious grouping and are administered through Management Committees on each of which the appropriate religious authority is represented. These Government schools are eight in number and grouped thus:

One each—Anglican/Methodist Boys', Girls' and Infants' School;
One each—Roman Catholic Boys', Girls' and Infants' School;
One each—Mohammedan Boys' and Infants' School.
There are also a Government infant school, a Government school for over-age pupils and a grant-aided Mission school; the total number of children enrolled is 3,553. There is also a Domestic Science Centre for girls and an Arts and Crafts Centre for boys. Government schools have been opened at Bakau and Serekunda in the Colony; the rolls total 620 and there is a Mission school with a roll of about 231. There are four secondary Mission schools in Bathurst, two for boys and two for girls. The total number of pupils on the rolls of these schools, which are controlled by the Missions concerned but receive substantial grants from Government, is 372 boys and 216 girls.

The Methodist Girls' High School runs private kindergarten and preparatory departments attended by 153 children.

In the Protectorate there is a Government boarding school at Georgetown, the Armitage School, which gives secondary modern education up to Form V. Twenty-two village schools have been opened by District Authorities. They are staffed by Government teachers seconded to the Authorities.

The Missions run four primary schools in the Upper River Division, and three in MacCarthy Island Division. One of the schools in MacCarthy Island Division is run jointly with the District Authorities.

There is a Teacher-training College at Yundum with 56 students. Twenty-five Gambians with Government scholarships and about 60 private students are in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education in 1956 was estimated at £95,700, compared with £5,038 in 1935.

Health

The most common diseases are malaria, trypanosomiasis, ascariasis, yaws, bronchitis, leprosy and eye infections. The Health Services include special mosquito control units in Bathurst, Cape St. Mary and at Yundum Airport. Sanitary Inspectors are posted to important points in the Colony and Protectorate. The little-used Infectious Diseases Hospital, after renovation and repair, was opened as a Sanatorium in 1953 for treatment of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease which is becoming more prevalent.

Medical facilities in the Gambia are based on two general Hospitals, one at Bathurst and one at Bansang. The new Victoria Hospital, Bathurst, serves the town and surrounding area, is equipped to deal with general medical and surgical cases, and has an obstetrical unit and an out-patients' department. Bansang Hospital in MacCarthy Island Division of the Protectorate caters for general medical and surgical cases, has a few beds for obstetrical cases, and an out-patients' department. In 1956, 3,845 in-patients and 38,666 out-patients were treated in these hospitals; the total number of out-patient attendances was 56,866.

There are Health Centres at Basse, Georgetown, Kuntaur, Brikama, Bakau and Mansa Konko and 38 Government and 3 Anglican mission dispensaries and sub-dispensaries situated throughout the Protectorate. Total attendances in 1956 were 250,920.

Maternity and child welfare remains chiefly centred in Bathurst, but there are twelve such clinics, three in the Island of St. Mary, five in Western Division, three in MacCarthy Island Division and one in Upper River Division.

A UNICEF "Milk Scheme" commenced in February, 1956, under which 2,027 school-children per week received a daily ration of milk, sugar and vitamin capsules. Antenatal and Infant Welfare Clinics also issued milk and vitamin capsules to a total of 88,550 needy mothers during the year.

Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1956 was £131,619 compared with £32,315 in 1935.

Communications

The aerodrome at Yundum, 17 miles from Bathurst, is controlled by the Government and operated on behalf of the Ministry of Civil Aviation by International Aeradio Limited. The Public Works Department maintains runways, buildings, power and water supplies and the meteorological services are operated by the West African Meteorological Service. The West African Airways Corporation service between Accra and Dakar calls twice a week on its northerly and southerly flights. Hunting Clan and Airwork Limited each call once a week in both directions, on their scheduled "Colonial Coach Class" service between the United Kingdom and Ghana.

There are 40 miles of tar macadam roads, 185 miles of laterite gravel all-season roads and approximately 634 miles of earth roads open to motor traffic during the dry season. Bituminous main roads are under construction and paving of the streets in Bathurst is in progress.

The chief port is Bathurst, which handled 45,742 tons of cargo and 1,480 passengers in 1956. Services for passengers and cargo are provided by the Elder Dempster Lines and Palm Line and occasionally by John Holt and Company. River ports are used for the loading of some 46,000 tons of groundnuts into ocean-going shipping annually. The H.M.C.S. Lady Wright and the H.M.C.S. Fulladu maintain a weekly service between the main river ports from Bathurst to Basse, a distance of about 242 miles up the Gambia River. The two vessels carried in 1956 a total of 17,953 passengers and approximately 4,661 tons of cargo.

There are no railways.

Broadcasting

There is no wireless or wired broadcasting station in the Gambia. Domestic radio receivers operate without restriction.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated numbers in other occupations are:

| Occupation          | Number |
|---------------------|--------|
| Government Service  | 2,287  |
| Building            | 157    |
| Distributive Trades | 1,449  |
| Shipping            | 361    |
| Others              | 989    |

There are three registered Trade Unions—Bathurst Trade Union, Gambia Labour Union and Gambia River Trade and Commercial Workers' Union. The number of members is not known.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are groundnuts, for export and oil production, rice, sorghum and millet; some maize and a little cotton for village weaving are also grown.
Alluvial deposits of ilmenite exist in the coastal districts of the Gambia. The concession is held by a subsidiary of a United Kingdom firm and extraction has now begun.

Preliminary investigations into the possibility of drilling for oil have been made with results which are not yet conclusive.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 122,477; sheep 50,527; goats 75,468; pigs 2,614; horses 209; donkeys 4,307; poultry 227,130.

A fair amount of fish is caught in coastal waters and some in the lower river; very little, however, is done further up-river, though fish are fairly plentiful.
