FEDERATION OF MALAYA

The Federation of Malaya attained independence as a member of the Commonwealth on the 31st August 1957, and Her Majesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Settlements of Penang and Malacca was terminated at that date, those Settlements becoming States of the new Federation. The new Federation of Malaya (Persekutuan Tanah Melayu) is an elective monarchy, having its own Head of State (His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong) and recognises Her Majesty the Queen as Head of the Commonwealth. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is henceforward the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the Federation of Malaya.

Basic information about the Federation will be found in the 1957 edition of the Colonial Office List.
