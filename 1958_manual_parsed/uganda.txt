UGANDA

Area

The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles (Northern Province 28,898, Buganda 25,631, Eastern Province 25,607, Western Province 13,845) of which 13,689 square miles are water and swamp.
Population

The total population of the Protectorate as shown by the 1948 census was 4,958,520, made up as follows:

- Africans: 4,917,555
- Indians: 33,767
- Goans: 1,448
- Arabs: 1,475
- Europeans: 3,448
- Others: 827

The estimated total at 30th June, 1956 was 5,593,000.

Principal Towns

The principal towns are Entebbe (seat of the Governor and the Central Government, population about 8,000), Kampala (commercial capital, population nearing 43,000), Jinja (population over 19,000), Mbale and Masaka. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Toro, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale and Mubende.

Geographical Features

The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,030 feet at Lake Albert and below 200 feet in the valley of the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Mufumbiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,547 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margherita (16,763 feet) and Alexandra (16,703 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasien (10,074 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, the Aswa and the Malawa. The total area of forest is approximately 2,677 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

Climate

The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70° and 75° but is lower in the highlands of the west and south-west. In the Entebbe/Kampala area (approximately 3,700 feet above sea level) the mean temperature, the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures are 71° F., 79° F. and 63° F. respectively. The average rainfall varies from 30 to 60 inches according to the area. The rainy seasons are not clearly defined and vary from one long season from April to September in the extreme north to two seasons March to May and September to November at the Equator.

History

In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa's dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company's influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga's kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June, 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga's kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1899 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and in 1900 concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. The same year a similar Agreement was made with the Chiefs in Toro, and in 1901 with Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1902 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika Territory. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.

Constitution

The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions.

Changes in structure of both Councils were approved by the Secretary of State in July, 1955. By these changes Executive Council consists of 13
members (10 of whom are Ministers), and the Governor as President.

The Legislative Council consists of 62 members and is presided over by a Speaker. The members are made up of 3 ex officio members, 13 other Government ministers and officials, and 16 nominated members on the Government Backbench; the remaining 30 are representative members.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the others owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 and the Buganda Agreement, 1955, by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka, acting as a constitutional ruler, with the advice of six Ministers. A hierarchy of chiefs are the executive officers of government. The Great Lukiko (i.e. the council of Buganda) contains 89 members of whom 40 are elected indirectly and 20 are elected by the county councils. In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces African local governments have been established with district councils as the most important organs. Most of these now have as their principal executive officers an elected Secretary-General and an appointed Treasurer. In the Agreement districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro special conditions prevail.

County, sub-county, parish and village chiefs are the executive officers of local government and are advised and assisted by councils. These are at four levels—the parish, the sub-county, the county and the district—which provide a chain of elections from the bottom upwards.

Under the provisions of the District Administration (District Councils) Ordinance of 1955, the district councils are being reconstituted, and elections to them are by and from the sub-county council, missing out the county council. In some districts elections to the district council are held separately and either by indirect or direct methods according to the wishes of the inhabitants.

Land Policy

Approximately 10,000 square miles of land is registered as being in private ownership of Africans, mainly in Buganda and Western Province. Approximately 440 square miles is in non-African hands. The remainder of the land in the Territory is vested in the Crown in trust for the use and benefit of the African population. In townships and in Buganda Province Africans may only occupy such land in accordance with a lease or licence; elsewhere they may occupy it without lease or licence according to native custom. No further grants in freehold are made to non-Africans, and alienations by lease are given only after consultation with the African Local Government concerned. African-owned land may not be transferred to non-Africans without the consent of the Minister of Land Tenure.

Taxation

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll tax, export taxes, stamp and estate duties, Customs and excise duties.

Income Tax is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from or received in East Africa by residents after any personal allowances have been deducted, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents. There is provision for double taxation relief between Uganda and the United Kingdom. Any person liable to pay African poll tax is exempt from paying income tax. A surtax is imposed on every £ of total income in excess of £2,000. On £2,004 the surtax is 1/- rising to Shs. 45,187/- on a total income of £9,500. Thereafter the next £10,500 is charged 10/- for every £ and the next £30,000 Shs. 10/50 for every £. Where total income exceeds £50,000 per annum the rate on the excess is 11/- in every £.

Poll Tax is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of 6/- per year throughout the Protectorate. An African Local Government Tax is levied by African local governments varying from 10/- to 150/- according to district and capacity to pay. Non-African Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £7 10/- on incomes exceeding £200 per annum, and £3 15/- on lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

Export Taxes are levied on lint cotton, coffee and hides and skins on a sliding scale by value, and on cotton seed by weight.

Companies Tax. The rate of Income Tax applicable to companies is 4/- on every £ of chargeable income accrued in, derived from or received in the Protectorate. Non-resident companies are assessed on the same basis as resident companies.

Customs and Excise. The tariff is divided into ad valorem, specific and free goods. Ad valorem duties vary from 10% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 22% ad valorem. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer and matches.

Development Plans

The first revision of the Five-year Capital Development Plan for the period 1955-60 was completed in 1957. The revised capital expenditure envisaged totals just over £34 million, in the following categories:

| Category                                      | Amount   |

Total: £35,800,000

The Capital Development Plan also envisages capital development by public corporations totalling £17,000,000

Other Development

The Uganda Development Corporation Limited was established by Government in 1952 with an authorized capital of £8,000,000 (£5,500,000 issued). The Corporation's purpose is to facilitate the industrial and economic development of the Protectorate by promoting and assisting in the financing, management or establishment of new undertakings wherever possible in conjunction with private enterprise and of schemes for the better organization, modernization or efficient carrying out of any undertaking. Its subsidiary companies are the Uganda Cement Industry Limited, the Uganda Fish Marketing Corporation Limited, the Uganda Hotels Limited, Agricultural Enterprises Limited, Uganda Consolidated Properties Limited and the Uganda Metal Products and Enamelling Company Limited.

The Corporation is also a partner in a number of enterprises engaged in the development of mining, the textile industry and other manufactures. One of these, Kilembe Mines Limited, is producing copper from deposits prior to export. Another, Sukulu Mines Limited, has been formed to mine and process the mineral complex at Sukulu, near Tororo, which consists principally of apatite, magnetite, and pyrochlore. A third, Nyanza Textile Industries Limited, is producing cloth from locally grown cotton.

The Uganda Electricity Board, a public utility corporation, is pressing forward with extensions to the distribution of electricity supplies which are obtained mainly from the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja where there is an installed capacity of 60,000 kW, and which is capable of expansion to provide 150,000 kW. It is estimated that there is an additional potential output of some 500,000 kW. in the 19 mile stretch of the river Nile below Owen Falls, and even more on the reach of the Nile between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert.

Education

The majority of the African Schools are managed by religious Voluntary Agencies: the administration of Asian Schools is shared between Government and the local communities. Primary education is provided for European children in the big towns, but for secondary education they attend schools in Kenya or elsewhere.

At the end of 1956 there were 1,994 grant-aided primary schools (280,557 pupils) and 130 grant-aided secondary schools (15,724 pupils). The number of un-aided schools exceeded 2,500, with a total enrolment of about 124,000. There were also 40 Teacher-Training Colleges with an enrolment of 4,054 students, and 58 technical and trade schools with total enrolment of 3,338.

The University College of East Africa at Makerere (Kampala) is an autonomous institution catering for all the East African territories: since 1953 the College has, in special relationship with London University, awarded degrees to its students. In 1956 there were 625 students attending the College of whom 211 came from Uganda. In addition 367 Uganda students were in receipt of scholarships or bursaries from various sources and were attending courses overseas, in the United Kingdom, India, the U.S.A. and elsewhere.
The total recurrent expenditure by the Protectorate Government on all types of education, in the financial year 1955-56 was £2,990,552. Capital expenditure totalled £1,051,290. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Libraries and Museums, etc.

There is a public library at Kampala; the Uganda Museum is also situated there.

Health

The commonest causes of illness are malaria, respiratory infections, diseases of the digestive system, trachoma, tropical ulcers and venereal disease.

Special attention is being paid to the control of Tuberculosis and Leprosy. Special wards are available for the treatment of tuberculosis cases at Mulago and three district hospitals, but treatment is given to in-patients and out-patients at all district hospitals. During the year some 1,050 new patients came under treatment for the first time. From widespread surveys it is estimated that the total number of lepers in the Protectorate is about 70,000. About 25,000 of these received treatment during the year. In addition to the five major leprosy centres run by the Missions, African Local Governments have established 55 treatment villages.

In addition to Mulago, which is the teaching hospital for Makerere College Medical School with 628 beds, the Department maintains 28 hospitals at the main centres giving a combined bed strength for all races of 2,744. In rural areas the African Local Governments, in conjunction with the Medical Department, maintain 162 Units with a bed strength of 1,951 of which 420 are reserved for maternity cases. Beds in Mission hospitals and dispensaries, industrial concerns, prisons, etc., amount to 2,371. The total number of beds throughout the Protectorate therefore amounts to 7,694, which gives a ratio of approximately 1·3 hospital beds per 1,000 of the population.

In 1956 86,747 patients were admitted to Government hospitals, and 874,013 were treated as out-patients. A total of 2,797,033 patients were treated in Government hospitals and dispensaries during the year.

Expenditure on the Medical Department for the financial year 1955-56 was £1,500,122 compared with £148,907 in 1935.

Communications

At Entebbe there is a first-class international airport with a main runway capable of receiving all commercial aircraft now flying and those designed for the immediate future. The Airport is equipped with the latest navigational aids, and the safety services are of a high standard. Several main trunk route operators use Entebbe, which has excellent flying weather throughout the year. It is estimated that more than 86,000 passengers will use the airport during 1957.

Secondary airfields are maintained by the Uganda Government at Kasese, Jinja, Tororo, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Masindi, Mbarara and Moroto, the first seven of which are served on regular schedules by the East African Airways Corporation. The Trustees of the Uganda National Parks maintain landing grounds at Kasenyi and Murchison Falls, serving the Queen Elizabeth and Murchison Falls Parks.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission").

The direct line from the coast runs westwards across the Protectorate through Tororo, Jinja and Kampala to Kasese near the Belgian Congo border. Another line northwards from Jinja connects at Namasagali with a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga to Masindi Port. The Railways Administration operates a road transport service between Masindi Port and Butiaba, on Lake Albert, and a steamer service on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule which is connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan. Another steamer service operates between Butiaba and the Belgian Congo ports of Mahagi and Kasenyi on the west shore of Lake Albert. A through service is thus provided by the Railways Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Belgian Congo. In addition regular steamer services connect Port Bell, Entebbe and Bukakata on Lake Victoria with Kisumu and Tanganyika ports.

The Public Works Department maintains 459 miles of tarmac road and 2,468 miles of all-weather murram roads connecting the principal towns; the various African Local Governments between them maintain a further 4,418 miles of all-weather murram roads and 3,881 miles of lesser murram roads of variable standard.

Broadcasting

The Uganda Broadcasting Service commenced regular transmission on 1st March, 1954, and now broadcasts daily in English, Luganda, and Luyoro, Lwo and Ateso. It operates on frequencies of 5,026 and 7,110 kc/s in the 60 and 41 metre bands respectively and also on 971 kc/s and 548kc/s in the medium wave band. Each of the medium wave channels is powered by two ½ kW transmitters operating in parallel; the short wave channel is powered by a 7½ kW transmitter. The transmitters are situated at Bugolobi near Kampala. Permanent studios are situated in Kampala.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle-raising on their own account. The numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in the principal industries and occupations in 1956-57 were: Agriculture 48,837; Government service (administrative) 12,759; African local government 36,963; cotton ginning 20,137; forestry and fishing 4,512; transport and communications 8,913; wholesale and retail trade 5,326; manufactures, including electricity 23,017; mining and quarrying 5,375; building and construction 36,169; education and medical services 20,207; other services 14,966: total 237,181.

The foregoing figures are based on a census covering employers of five or more persons excluding domestic servants. The estimated total numbers in employment, including occupations where less than five are employed, are 300,000 Africans, 14,500 Asians and 3,800 Europeans.

There are 14 registered trade unions with a total estimated membership of 3,500. Joint staff committees or works councils have been introduced in 95 establishments covering some 60,000 employees.
Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), maize, sugar, tea, tobacco, millets, plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava and groundnuts. In 1956 over 90% of the total value of domestic exports derived from cotton and coffee products.

The number of cattle sold in established markets in 1956 was 122,000. Hides and skins are an important export.

Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hardwoods. Internal consumption is rising rapidly and most of the timber available for export is absorbed by the other East African territories, from which in return the bulk of the Protectorate's softwood imports are obtained. In 1956 some 30,000 tons of sawn timber were produced.

Copper is now the chief mineral produced with wolfram following. Late in 1956 Kilembe Mine started production and now is running at its designed output of 40,000 tons of copper-cobalt ore per month. In 1956 production of wolfram was 170 tons and of galena 125 tons. Quantities of tin, gold, beryl, columbite/tantalite and bismuth continue to be produced and prospecting for chrome ore and radio-active minerals continues.

The fishing industry is of growing importance to Uganda. The present production is approximately 40,000 tons of fish per year, worth £1½ million and of this total 27,000 tons is consumed within the country, the remainder being exported to other East African Territories and the Belgian Congo.

The cement factory of Uganda Cement Industries is in full production and its capacity has recently been doubled. A textile factory at Jinja has commenced production, and is at present operating on two shifts up to the weaving of grey cloth; a dye house is nearing completion and is expected to come into operation soon. In the 1956-57 season 144 cotton ginneries were operating. The coffee crop was handled by 12 coffee curing works. Seven hullers, capable of bringing coffee to fair average quality standards, processed fixed quotas of the crop. A number of estate coffee factories processed the coffee grown on the larger estates. Amongst other undertakings processing agricultural produce were two sugar factories, 19 tea factories, four tobacco-processing works and large numbers of maize mills and oil-expressing mills.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. The Lint Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of the lint cotton and seed and the Coffee Industry Board for the coffee crop (excepting the Bugisu Arabica crop and the produce of estates and associations of growers permitted to conduct their own sales). Legislation which was enacted in 1953 and 1957 provides, inter alia for increased African participation in the processing side of the coffee industry. Producer prices are announced before the marketing season opens and it is also the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time.

The Cotton Price Assistance Fund stood at slightly more than £19,200,000 at 30th June, 1956. The Coffee Price Assistance Fund, as at 30th June, stood at £7,534,000.

Co-operative development was given formal recognition by Government by the enactment of co-operative legislation in 1946 and the establishment of a Co-operative Department to assist and guide it. Since that time, 1,283 societies have been registered, 15 of which are co-operative unions with a total membership of 127,887. The producer movement, comprising agricultural marketing and processing societies, dairy societies, fishing societies and co-operative farming societies, represents the main development, there being 1,053 registered societies; other branches, consumer co-operatives, thrift and credit and housing co-operatives are also present.

Participation in the processing of cotton and coffee has, with some financial assistance from Government, been gained by the African Farmers through the Co-operative Movement.

Eight cotton ginneries are now owned by co-operative unions while two are leased from Government with the intention to purchase as soon as funds are available. Another cotton ginnery has been constructed by Government for lease and purchase by a co-operative union. In 1956 these ginneries produced 21,138 bales of lint cotton or 5·8% of the total bale production of the Protectorate.

The Bugisu Co-operative Union again marketed the whole of the Bugisu arabica coffee crop which had dropped to 4,098 tons. The Uganda Growers Co-operative Union cured 600 tons of robusta coffee at its new factory in Kawempe near...
Kampala, and Masaka District Growers Co-operative Union working in conjunction with Nkoba Za Mbogo Farmers Co-operative Association produced 2,400 tons of clean robusta coffee.

The total turnover of the co-operative movement in 1956 was valued at £3,427,199.
