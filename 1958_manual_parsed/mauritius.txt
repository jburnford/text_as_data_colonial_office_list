MAURITIUS

Area

The area of Mauritius is approximately 720 square miles, that of Rodrigues 40 square miles and the area of the Lesser Dependencies, viz., the Chagos Archipelago (the largest islet is Diego Garcia), Agalega and the Cargados Carajos or St. Brandon Isles, approximately 47½ square miles.

Population

The estimated population at 31st December 1956 was: Mauritius 579,123, Rodrigues 16,034, Lesser Dependencies 1,700; divided approximately into: (1) general population, comprising Europeans and descendants of Europeans and people of African and mixed origin, 29%; (2) Indo-Mauritians, made up of immigrants from the Indian subcontinent and their descendants, 67%; and Chinese, consisting of immigrants from China and their descendants, 4%.

Geographical Features

The island lies in the Indian Ocean, 550 miles east of Madagascar. It is chiefly of volcanic formation but almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. There are several small chains of mountains, the principal peaks reaching about 2,700 feet. There are numerous rivers and streams; none of them is navigable beyond a short distance from the sea. Some of the larger waterfalls have been harnessed to supply hydro-electric power. The land rises gradually from the coasts, and the centre of the island is composed chiefly of a fertile plateau varying in altitude from 1,000 feet to 2,000 feet. Remnants of the native forests of the island cover some 15,000 acres.

Climate

The south-east trade winds blow during most of the year and the climate is generally humid. The mean temperature varies from 74°F at sea level to 67°F at 2,000 feet. The mean annual range is 11°F. The highest and lowest values recorded at the Observatory, Pamplemousses, at an altitude of 180 feet, are 94·8°F and 49·9°F respectively.

Rainfall differs considerably according to the height above sea level. On the highest part of the central plateau an average of 200 inches falls each year but amounts decrease rapidly to 70 and 35 inches on the windward and leeward coasts. There is no marked dry season but in the three months from September to November rainfall is about one quarter of the fall in the three wettest months, January to March.

Tropical cyclones may occur between September and May but by far the greatest frequency and intensity is in January and February; March and April also being important months owing to the greater susceptibility to damage of the grown sugar cane. In nearly 100 years gust wind speeds have reached 100 m.p.h. on only two or three occasions and have reached 60 m.p.h. in about thirty cyclones passing near the island.

History

Mauritius was probably first visited by Arab sailors and by Malays during the Middle Ages. During the early sixteenth century Portuguese sailors visited the island several times and the first European to discover it is believed to have been Domingos Fernandez. The Portuguese used it merely as a port of call without making any settlement. The first settlers were the Dutch who landed in 1598 and gave the island the name of Mauritius in honour of their ruler, Prince Maurice of Nassau. Settlements were established from 1638 onwards but did not prosper, and the island was abandoned in 1710. In 1715 the island was formally taken possession of by the French. A small first contingent of colonists was sent in 1721 from the neighbouring island of Reunion (then called Bourbon), but it was not actually occupied until 1722 when a small party of colonists was sent out on behalf of the French East India Company. The Island was then named Isle de France. From 1722 till about 1767 it was governed by that Company. From 1767 to 1810, apart from the brief period of independence under the Colonial Assembly during the French Revolution, it was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government.

During the long war between England and France, French men-of-war and privateers based on the Isle de France were a source of great mischief to the English merchant vessels. The British Government decided to capture the island and in 1810 a strong British expedition was eventually successful. The former name of Mauritius was then restored to it, and, with its dependencies, including Rodrigues, it was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Constitution

The Government is vested in a Governor with an Executive and a Legislative Council. In accordance with Letters Patent, Royal Instructions and Order in Council dated the 9th December, 1947, the Legislative Council is composed of three ex officio, 12 nominated unofficial, and 19 elected members. A Speaker was appointed in November 1956. The Executive Council includes three officials (the Colonial Secretary, the Financial Secretary and the Procureur and Advocate-General) and four members selected by the Legislative Council from amongst the non-official members; the Royal Instructions provide for the appointment of other members to Executive Council. In July 1957, a Ministerial system was introduced, Executive Council being enlarged at the same time to include nine Unofficial Members and the three Officials. Six of the Unofficial Members hold portfolios and three are Ministers without Portfolio.

Under the constitution, a British subject, male or female, of 21 years of age or upwards, who has been ordinarily and bona fide resident in the Colony for a period of two years preceding an election, and—

(a) can pass a simple literacy test; or
(b) has an armed forces qualification; or
(c) has a business premises qualification;

is entitled to vote, unless debarred under the specific disqualifications listed in section 17 of the Order in Council. Proposals for a revision of the constitution were discussed at a conference in London in February 1957.

Land Policy

Roughly one-sixth of the area of the island is owned by the Crown and consists of (a) Crown lands proper made up of unceded lands and lands re-acquired by the Crown, and (b) "Pas Geometriques" being reserved land lying on the sea coast between the high water mark in spring tides and a line drawn parallel to the general contour of the coast at a distance of 81·21 metres. Alienable Crown lands may be sold only by public auction, except in the case of lands required for religious, charitable or educational purposes, or for public utility, when a nominal price is charged. The deeds of sale do not alienate the right of the Crown in respect of any mines of precious stones or metals or any layer of mineral oil or the right of the Crown of entering the property for the purpose of mining or of boring and collecting mineral oil, but no other restrictive clause is inserted in the deed of conveyance. Crown lands ("Pas Geometriques" excluded) may be leased by private contract or public auction. Portions of
"Pas Geometriques" not exceeding two hectares may be leased by private contract after publication of notices. In the case of portions exceeding two hectares, the lease must be by public auction.

The remaining five-sixths of the area of the island are privately owned lands of which the holders are free to dispose as they think fit.

Taxation

Income tax rates for individuals are:

| Chargeable Income | Rate of tax cents |
|-------------------|------------------|
| For every rupee of the first Rs. 5,000 | 10 |

| Rs. 25,000 | 60 |
| Rs. 25,000 | 70 |
| For every rupee of the remainder of the chargeable income | 80 |

In ascertaining the chargeable income a number of deductions are allowed.

Company tax is at the rate of 40%.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariff and excise duties.

Education

On 31st October, 1956, there were 383 educational establishments in Mauritius. Of this total, 313 were primary schools and one post-primary, 6 secondary and one post-secondary, with a total of 100,682 pupils. The Government institutions comprised 86 primary schools, one post-primary school, three secondary schools, one training college for teachers and a College of Agriculture. Eight secondary and 77 primary schools within the total given above were State-aided. There were also a number of private day and evening schools teaching such subjects as the Koran, Urdu and Hindi. The development of technical education is under consideration and it is hoped to make a start shortly with a new Technical Institute. The Government awarded 6 scholarships in 1956 for higher education overseas. Mauritian students overseas, mainly in United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Universities, numbered 511.

Adult education courses provide for post-primary and post-secondary education with extension classes in Science, Handwork, Art, Typewriting, Shorthand, Book-keeping, and electrical engineering courses for apprentices.

In the financial year 1956–57, expenditure on education was Rs.14,661,645. In 1955 expenditure was Rs.1,347,201.

Libraries and Museums

There are seven Libraries:—(i) Police Library, Port Louis, (ii) Municipality of Port Louis Library, (iii) Town Council of Beau Bassin/Rose Hill Library, (iv) Carnegie Library, Curepipe, (v) Mauritius Institute Library, Port Louis, (vi) British Council Library, Rose Hill, (vii) Urban Council of Quatre Bornes Library.
The Natural History Museum, Port Louis, and the Historical Museum, Mahebourg, are both run by the Mauritius Institute. A small art gallery is also annexed to the Port Louis Museum.

**Health**

The continuation of the Malaria Eradication Scheme has resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the disease from Mauritius. Three cases of malaria were admitted to the public hospitals during the year under review. The main causes of morbidity were influenza and other diseases of the respiratory system, anaemias, diseases of the digestive system, and accidents.

The health inspectorate works from health offices of which there are 14 throughout the island. The total number of beds available in 1956 was 1,207 in general hospitals, 707 at the Mental Hospital, 137 at the Orthopaedic Centre, 62 at the Leper Asylum and 46 in the Prison hospitals. In addition, 33 sugar estates provide each a small hospital with a total of 738 beds for the sole benefit of their employees. There were also three private nursing homes, 47 static dispensaries (excluding two prisons’ dispensaries), four mobile dispensaries and two mobile dental clinics. The Maternal and Infant Welfare Service provides ten static centres and one mobile antenatal clinic. Admissions to hospitals numbered 30,952; attendances at static dispensaries numbered 501,072 and at mobile dispensaries 81,822.

The expenditure on medical services during the financial year 1956–57 amounted to Rs.11,045,710 against an actual expenditure of Rs.1,964,369 in 1929–30.

**Communications**

The airport (Plaisance) is run by the Colonial Government and the meteorological services are under the control of the Director, Royal Alfred Observatory. Air France operates a scheduled “Super Constellation” service twice a week between Paris and Mauritius through Cairo, Nairobi, Madagascar and Réunion. Qantas Empire Airways operate a scheduled “Super Constellation” service between Sydney and Johannesburg via Melbourne, Darwin, Cocos Islands and Mauritius. No internal services exist.

The railway carried 614,396 passengers and 492,202 tons of freight in 1955–56. Track mileage totalled 82.

There are in the Colony about 500 miles of main roads, 230 miles of branch roads, and 43 miles of streets in villages and extra-urban areas. About 391 miles of main and branch roads have been asphalted.

Port Louis, the capital of the island, is also the only port; it can accommodate ten ocean-going vessels at any one time, and four small vessels. Regular cargo services are provided from the United Kingdom by the British and Commonwealth Shipping Company, and from continental ports by the French companies Messageries Maritimes Limited and Nouvelle Cie. Havraise Peninsulaire; an infrequent service is also provided by a combined French and Swedish Company, Svédé Lines. Passenger services from the United Kingdom direct to Mauritius are infrequent; the French vessels direct from Marseilles to Mauritius provide the better service. The Dutch Royal Interocean Lines vessels call at Port Louis regularly on their Far East–South Africa–South America service, providing a regular passenger and cargo service to and from South Africa. During 1956, 345 vessels entered Port Louis giving a total of 1,304,495 net tons.

**Broadcasting**

Government runs the Mauritius Broadcasting Service, which has a monopoly in the Colony. The station at Forest Side operates on 220 metres, 1,364 kc/s medium wave and 19·88 metres, 15,604 kc/s short-wave with powers of 5 kW. and 1½ kW. respectively. In June 1957, there were 24,646 wireless licences in force in the Colony, with an estimate of five listeners per receiver.

**Principal Occupations**

Cane plantations and sugar manufacture give employment to approximately 4,500 skilled and 51,000 unskilled workers. Other industries are tea planting and manufacture, employing some 1,700 workers; tobacco 1,800; aloe fibre 1,400. The docks and stevedoring companies give employment to about 2,000 workers; the building trade over 1,300; Government and private services 10,900.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops are sugar-cane, “aloe” (Furcraea) fibre, tea and tobacco. Sugar is produced in 26 factories the modernization of which is nearly completed. Practically all the “aloe” fibre produced is utilized locally for the manufacture of sugar bags. The Colony grows some of its subsidiary foodstuffs and vegetables and produces a proportion of its vegetable oil requirements. Coconut oil is extracted at a factory in Port Louis from copra obtained from the dependencies known as the Oil Islands. The only by-product of sugar cane is alcohol, of which 17,300 hectolitres of 100° G.L. were produced in 1956.

The livestock population is estimated to be roughly: bovines 42,000 (of which 38,000 are of the local or “creole” milk breed); goats, 54,000; pigs, 4,000; sheep, 2,000.

The catch of fish in territorial waters is approximately 2,000 tons a year.

*Excluding value of sugar quota certificates.
The chief imports are grain and flour, edible oils and fats, petroleum products, textiles, vehicles, iron and steel goods and electrical goods, coal, cement and fertilizers.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The whole of the sugar produced is marketed by the Sugar Syndicate. Out of the saleable sugar crop, a guaranteed quota of 335,000 long tons is sold to the United Kingdom Sugar Board at a price fixed by agreement and the balance is sold on the world market.

On the 28th February, 1956, there were 300 registered co-operative societies with a membership of 28,216, paid-up share capital amounting to Rs.1,245,833 and General Reserves totalling Rs.1,542,931. The turnover in goods and services for the year was Rs.53,843,164, including Rs.13,687,349 worth of sugar sold through 130 credit societies, and Rs. 22,411 worth of ginger sold through a marketing society.
