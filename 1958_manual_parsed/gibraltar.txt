GIBRALTAR

Geographical Features and Area

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, with an area of 24 square miles. It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 24 miles and its greatest breadth nearly 1 mile.

Population

The population is European and at the Census of July 1951 numbered 22,848. At the end of 1956 it was estimated at 25,064.

Climate

The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the "Levanter", strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.

History

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

Constitution

The Gibraltar (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1950, as amended by a further Order in Council which came into operation on 10th August, 1956, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, three ex officio members, two nominated members appointed by the Governor and seven elected members. The ex officio members are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. Provision is also made for the appointment of a Speaker. The Order in Council empowers the Governor to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony with the advice and consent of the Council. The Governor possesses the usual reserved power to pass into law any measure necessary or expedient in his opinion in the interests of public order, public faith or good government (including defence). The Gibraltar Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions provide that the Governor shall be advised in the exercise of his powers by an Executive Council consisting of four ex officio members and four unofficial members. The ex officio members are the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

Taxation

This is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance was enacted in April 1952 and came into force on the 1st April 1953; the standard rate, for companies and individuals, is 2s. in the £. There are no excise duties.

The main heads of taxation are:

- Customs.
- Income Tax.
- Estate Duties.
- Stamp Duties.
- Licences.
- Fuel Oil Tax.

The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco, coffee, mechanical lighters, motor vehicles, motor vehicle spares and accessories, photographic cameras and cinema projectors, radio sets and spares, razor blades, watches and clocks.

The Government lottery yielded £101,016 in 1956.

In addition there was a balance of £162,500 outstanding on an interest-free loan of £250,000 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

Currency

Gibraltar Government notes and United Kingdom silver and copper coins are legal tender in the Colony. Notes to the value of £1,112,515 were in circulation at 31st December 1956. The issue is governed by the Currency Note Ordinance and is of the following denominations: £5, £1, 10s.

Development Plans

A Port Development Scheme has been approved to improve the facilities of the Port. A sum of £300,000 has been earmarked from Gibraltar's Colonial Development and Welfare allocation for this purpose.

Work on a five-year plan to build over 300 flats by 1960 is in progress.

Education

There are six secondary and 17 primary and infants' schools conducted by the Department of Education, with a total number of pupils at 31st December, 1956, of 3,722. Government expenditure on education in 1956 amounted to £116,970 compared with £9,863 in 1935.

Approximately 40 students of both sexes are undergoing courses of higher education in the United Kingdom.

Libraries and Museums

A lending library is maintained by the British Council. At the Gibraltar Garrison Library, established in 1793, an extensive reference section and a well-supplied lending library are available to members. The Museum contains exhibits of historical interest connected with Gibraltar.

Health

Total expenditure on medical and public health services in 1956 was £152,736 compared with £22,966 in 1935. The number of beds available in hospitals was:

- Colonial Hospital (General) including King George VI Memorial Wing: 167
- King George V Hospital (Diseases of the Chest): 64
- Infectious Diseases Hospital: 30
- Mental Hospital: 59

The number of in-patients at the Colonial Hospital during the year was 2,510 and outpatient attendances numbered 35,628.

Communications

There is no civil airfield in the Colony, but restricted use of the R.A.F. aerodrome at North Front by civil aircraft is permitted, subject to termination if military considerations so require. British European Airways operate daily services between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, via Madrid. Gibraltar Airways operate a daily service (two flights) to and from Tangier.

The length of road open for traffic is 5½ miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3½ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.

The total arrival of vessels of all kinds during 1956 was 8,465 with a net tonnage of 10,624,957. The majority called for oil or coal bunkers or repairs. The following passenger services were in operation:

- Orient Line to and from the United Kingdom/Australia: monthly
- Union Castle Line to and from the United Kingdom/East Africa: monthly
- P. & O. Line, United Kingdom/Australia: monthly
- Australia/United Kingdom: Feb/July
- Anchor Line to United Kingdom only: Aug/Dec
- British India Line to United Kingdom only: monthly
- Royal Rotterdam Lloyd to United Kingdom and Rotterdam: alternate months
- Italia Line to and from Italy/New York: weekly
- Home Lines to and from Piraeus/New York: monthly
- Lauro Lines to and from Italy/New York: monthly
- Zim Israel Line to and from Haifa/New York: monthly

Approximately one cargo vessel a week arrived from the United Kingdom. A daily passenger and car ferry service to and from Tangier is operated by the Bland Line. There is also a daily passenger service between Gibraltar and Algeciras.

Broadcasting

Late in 1956 approval was given for the establishment of a Government Broadcasting Station and it is hoped that the Station will begin to operate early in 1958. It is intended to make time available on the air for commercial broadcasting. At present those desiring to obtain British programmes listen to short-wave transmissions from the B.B.C. There is a local wired broadcasting service, operated by the military authorities for military personnel, which also relays programmes from the B.B.C. During 1956, 4,821 radio receiving licences were issued.

Principal Occupations

More than half of the male wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Colonial Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment. Other local industries are the processing of tobacco and the roasting and blending of coffee. There is also a fish and fruit canning factory.
At the end of December 1956 the total insured labour force was 18,362. There are 17 registered trade unions in the Colony with a reported total paid-up membership of some 4,007.

Trade

Actual figures of imports are available only for dutiable articles and the figures given below are therefore largely estimates:

| Year | Total Imports | Re-exports |
|------|---------------|------------|
| 1951 | £6,729,900    | £3,698,084 |
| 1952 | £7,522,931    | £4,034,771 |
| 1953 | £8,108,213    | £3,072,267 |
| 1954 | £6,483,686    | £2,758,701 |
| 1955 | £6,657,787    | £2,742,779 |
| 1956 | £8,393,017    | £3,645,373 |

The figures of re-exports are only in respect of goods liable to import duty upon entry.

Tourist Trade

The number of visitors passing through the Colony continues to increase. To meet this increase two hotels are being enlarged, a new one has been built and every possible facility is being given. Places of interest such as the Caves, Galleries, Moorish Castle and the Upper Rock may now be visited without permits.

Sightseeing passengers from ships: 1955 - 43,995; 1956 - 44,763

Other tourists in transit and visitors: 1955 - 61,331; 1956 - 77,000
