THE FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALAND

History and Constitution
A short account of the events leading up to the establishment of the Federation in September, 1953, and a summary of the Federal Constitution, are to be found in the Colonial Office Lists for 1954 and 1955.

Responsibilities of Her Majesty's Government
The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations acts as the channel of communication between Her Majesty's Government and the Federal Government, as well as between Her Majesty's Government and the territorial Government of Southern Rhodesia. The Secretary of State for the Colonies remains responsible for the territorial affairs of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

NORTHERN RHODESIA
(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.)

Area
The Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia lies on the plateau of Central Africa. Its area is 288,130 square miles, including 3,000 square miles of inland water.
Population

The estimated population at 31st December, 1956 was as follows:

- African: 2,140,000
- European: 71,000
- Asian: 5,800
- "Coloured": 1,600

Total: 2,218,400

Geographical Features

With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers, the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000–5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 716 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate

There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 23 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°–100°, but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. de Lacerda, who led an expedition to Chief Kasembe's capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in 1798. Though he died before reaching his goal, his diaries provide the first authoritative account of what is now north-eastern Rhodesia. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty's Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be, and on 17th October, 1900, the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika's dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed, and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the
British South Africa Company, but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company's administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company, and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April, 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

**Constitution**

The Protectorate is one of the three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 131). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council of nine, five officials and four unofficials, presided over by the Governor. Each member of the Council, whether official or unofficial, is responsible for a group of Departments. The Legislative Council consists of twenty-six members, of whom eight are official, twelve are elected Europeans, two are Europeans nominated by the Governor to represent African interests, and four are Africans, nominated by the Governor (who usually nominates those selected by the African Representative Council from among its own members). It is presided over by the Speaker, who is an unofficial but not a member of the Legislative Council.

**Land Policy**

Land is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land is alienated on leasehold tenure by the Land Board which insists on certain standards of finance and farming skill. There is in certain areas freehold land held by private persons to which title was obtained in the early days. An Agricultural Lands Ordinance has now been enacted making it possible for the lessee of Crown Land to obtain conditional freehold title to his farm on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance.

**Taxation**

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and customs and excise duties on the 1st April, 1954.

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 10s. and £1 per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 5s. and 13s. 6d. per annum made by Native Authorities.

**Public Finance**

The establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October 1953 resulted in considerable changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements. To conform with the Federal Government's financial year, which runs from the 1st July to the 30th June, the Territory's accounts were not closed on the 31st December 1953, the financial period being extended to the 30th June 1954.

The Territory retained its full revenue and met its full recurrent expenditure up to the 31st December 1953. For the six months period ended the 30th June 1954, revenue to which the Federal Government had become entitled was collected on behalf of that Government and paid over, except that the Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April 1954. With effect from the 1st January 1954 the Federal Government assumed full financial responsibility for the Departments which it was due to take over, and refunded to the Northern Rhodesia Government the full cost of administering them. The figures in the following table relating to the first six months of 1954 are not, therefore, comparable with those in preceding years, as both revenue and expenditure totals include figures resulting from the settlements between the two Governments. The principal Departments and services taken over by the Federal Government in 1954 were as follows:

- Audit
- Civil Aviation
- Military
- Prisons
- Customs
- Income Tax
- Posts and Telegraphs
- European Education
- Health

European Agriculture was taken over by the Federal Government from the 1st January, 1956.

The main sources of revenue are now the payment received from the Federal Government representing 18% of the collections within the Federation on account of taxes on income, and the Territorial surcharge on Company Income Tax assessments also collected by the Federal Government on behalf of the Northern Rhodesia Government. These two taxes represent 66% of the estimated revenue for 1956-57, and a further 12% is derived from mineral royalties. The Northern Rhodesian Government no longer collects Customs and Excise duties. These are levied by the Federal Government, and not shared with the other Territories of the Federation.

Currency

Up to the 23rd April, 1957, the currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The denominations were 10s., £1, £5 and £10 notes, cupro-nickel or copper halfpennies and pennies and cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns.

On the 23rd April, however, the Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which took over the assets of the Central Africa Currency Board on...
the 1st April, 1956, commenced the issue of new currency notes of the denominations of 10s., £1, £5 and £10. The two types of currency now circulate together, but the new will gradually replace the old as the latter becomes unfit for circulation. As from the 1st January, 1955, British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

Development Plans

The Northern Rhodesia Territorial Government's Development Plan is now estimated to cost £35,478,312 during the four-year period ending the 30th June, 1961. Expenditure will be met from the Capital Fund and is allocated as follows:

| Item                                      | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------------------------|------------|

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

At 30th June, 1957, there were 52 Government European schools, two Government-aided and eight private schools providing education for European children. Nine of the Government schools and one private school provided education up to Cambridge School Certificate standard. Post-Certificate education up to the Cambridge Higher Certificate is provided at seven of the Government Secondary Schools. There were 13 Government hostels housing 850 children.

The enrolment in European Government schools was 11,978; in Government-aided and private schools, 2,010. Technical education was given in conjunction with correspondence courses, and from the beginning of 1957 this field was covered on the Copperbelt by the Copperbelt Technical Foundation. This has started training under the aegis of the mines with assistance from the Ministry of Education. Government assistance in the form of bursaries, loans, etc., is available to those who proceed to higher education centres. Pupils from Northern Rhodesia may now attend the Training College for European teachers at Heany, near Bulawayo, and the University College at Salisbury.

There are 12 Government schools for Asiatics (1,149 children) and three for Coloureds (182). There is a Coloured hostel for 90 boarders and one Government-aided school accommodating 164 Coloured children.

Of approximately 510,000 African children of school age some 213,846 were in the following schools in 1956:

| Type of School                        | No. of Schools | No. of Pupils |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools   | 1,359          | 203,413       |
| Unaided primary schools               | 68             | 6,186         |
| Secondary schools                     | 11             | 1,198         |
| Teacher training schools              | 15             | 1,192         |
| Trades schools                        | 21             | 1,424         |
| Other vocational schools (girls)      | 15             | 433           |

There were two post-secondary Courses in operation, namely a Sixth Form at Munali Secondary School with some 50 pupils divided between first and second years and a course for the training of upper primary school teachers at Chalimbana Training College. Bursaries are awarded by both the Federal and Northern Rhodesia Governments for students to attend various courses of higher education. In September, 1956, there were 31 bursary holders both in Africa and in the United Kingdom.

A comparison of recurrent expenditure is made below.

| Year | African Education (£) | European Education (£) |

Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. Emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions, and of their contacts with the immigrant races.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia's National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times. The Library contains approximately 4,000 volumes which are available to members of the Northern Rhodesia Society.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Public health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

There are twelve Government European hospitals in the Territory. During 1956, 8,700 patients were admitted. The principal causes of admission were heart disease, violence (including all accidents), nervous diseases, cancer, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, malaria and colitic complaints.

The 14 Government African hospitals dealt with 57,000 admissions in 1956.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above, there are 137 rural health centres, and it is anticipated that a large Combined General Hospital for Europeans and Africans at Kitwe, and a Cottage Hospital for Europeans, Coloureds and Asians at Luanshya, will be in operation by the end of 1958.
Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications.

There is an international airport at Livingstone and national airports at Lusaka, Ndola and Kasama, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. Subsidiary airfields serve most of the outlying districts, but less than half are of all-weather construction.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 655 miles.

The total mileage of maintained roads in the territory is now 21,224, made up as follows:

| Roads Type          | Miles |
|---------------------|-------|
| Main roads          | 4,964 |
| District and Branch roads | 11,837 |
| Ungazetted tracks   | 166   |
| Town roads          | 154   |
| Rural roads         | 4,103 |

*Excluding those maintained by municipalities.

There are 507 miles of main roads of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes roads maintained by the Public Works Department through townships, and also roads completed but still maintained by contractors.

The Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control operates a passenger and goods service along the Zambezi River from Livingstone to Mongu. The first portion of the route is by road to Mambova on the Zambezi River from which joint power barges operate to Katima Mulilo. The remainder of the route is covered by road vehicles running on roads in close proximity to the river. During 1956 the service carried 4,579 tons of goods traffic and 12,383 passengers.

Broadcasting

The Central African Broadcasting Station is situated in Lusaka and broadcasts on two channels daily. The station radiates on three transmitters, one being of 15 kW and two of 2½ kW capacity.

Simultaneous broadcasting started early in 1956 and the total hours broadcast for Africans per week is 74. In addition a 4-hour programme is broadcast for Europeans each week, making a total of 78 hours.

The broadcasts are transmitted in eight vernaculars and English: Nyanja, Bemba, Tonga, Lozi, Lunda and Luvale for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Shona and Sindebele for Southern Rhodesia. Included daily is an hour of English for Africans.

Listener research indicates that approximately 100,000 Africans in the three territories own wireless sets and that at peak listening hours some 200,000 Africans tune to Lusaka. A wired broadcast service is installed in a Lusaka location and is controlled by the Central African Broadcasting Station.

The approximate livestock population is cattle 1,170,000, sheep and goats 132,000, and pigs 60,000. During 1956 some 38,000 head of cattle were slaughtered.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru, and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is cured and marketed in the urban areas.

Output of sawlogs, poles, and firewood amounted to 1,239,941 tons in 1956.

Mineral Production in 1956

| Mineral | Quantity | Approximate Value |
|---------|----------|-------------------|

| Limestone | 000 tons | 367 | 372 |

Also produced are tin, manganese, silver, gold, iron ore, selenium, beryl, mica and cadmium.

A very large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, steel finishing work, tiles, furniture, clothing, beer, mineral waters, soap and oils, metal castings and nuts and bolts.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of imports and exports and no separate figures for Northern Rhodesia are available.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

Co-operatives continue to develop. There has been lively and promising expansion particularly by the African agricultural producer marketing movement. The African thrift society movement is also progressing satisfactorily. Twenty-two new societies were registered during the year ended 31st December, 1956, and one small society dissolved.

Societies totalled 161 at 31st December, 1956, with a total membership of 17,680; total paid-up share capital was £414,094. The value of produce marketed through marketing societies was £5,213,167; the value of goods sold in consumer societies, consisting mainly of European membership and operating on the Copperbelt, amounted to £644,881.
