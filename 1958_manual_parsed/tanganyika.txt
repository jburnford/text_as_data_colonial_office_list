### TANGANYIKA

#### Area

The total area of the territory is 362,688 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of inland water. The land area (in square miles) of the eight Provinces into which the Territory is divided is as follows: Central 36,410, Eastern 42,094, Lake 39,134, Northern 32,165, Southern 55,223, Southern Highlands 45,472, Tanga 13,803 and Western 78,405.

#### Population

At mid-year 1956 it was estimated that there were 8,329,000 Africans, 28,000 Europeans, 76,000 Indians and Goans, 17,000 Arabs and 6,000 others—total non-African population 127,000. Among the Africans some 120 tribes can be distinguished. Some of these number only a few thousand persons, while the largest tribe in the Territory, the Sukuma, represents 12% of the African population and numbers about one million. Other large tribes in numerical order are the Nyamwezi, Ha, Makonde, Gogo, Haya and Chagga. These seven tribes together comprise 35% of the African population, and with the addition of a further six smaller tribes next in order make just 50% of the total African population.

#### Geographical Features

The two extremes of topographical relief of the whole continent of Africa lie within the boundaries of the Territory—Kilimanjaro, with a permanent ice-cap, rising to 19,340 feet above sea-level, and the deep trough-like depression filled by the waters of Lake Tanganyika, the world’s second deepest lake. Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to the great central plateau, which for the most part maintains an altitude of some 4,000 feet, is sharply defined along both its eastern and western margins by a series of steep-sided and deeply eroded escarpments, and falls sharply to the west to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika 2,534 feet; Nyasa 1,568 feet)* which lie in the trough of the great Rift Valley. Along both the eastern and western escarpment edges the plateau has been elevated to form long but relatively narrow belts of high country, rising in several places to over 7,000 feet. In the west this belt is cut by the valley of the Malagarasi River. This valley provides a drainage outlet to Lake Tanganyika from a large part of the

*Lake Victoria is 3,717 feet above sea level.*
central plateau, and thus extends the Congo-Atlantic drainage basin to within about 350 miles of the Indian Ocean. The escarpment to the east of Lake Nyasa is broken by the Ruhuhu River. The valley of the Ruhuhu is of importance as forming possibly the only practical alignment for a rail connexion between the coast and Lake Nyasa. Approximately half of the two great lakes, Victoria and Tanganyika, lie within the Territory's borders, and lakes Natron, Manyara, Eyasi (in the north) and Rukwa (in the southwest) account for most of the remainder of the 20,000 square miles of inland water.

Climate

Roughly, three climatic zones can be distinguished:

(i) The coast region and immediately adjoining hinterland—tropical, temperature seldom below 80° during October–May, when the two rainy seasons occur; between June and September it is much cooler; average temperature 76°; average rainfall 40 inches.

(ii) The central plateau, altitudes 2,000–4,000 feet—prevailing characteristics low humidity, rainfall 20–40 inches annually, mean temperature over 70° with great daily and seasonal variations, sometimes exceeding 30° daily; nights almost invariably cool.

(iii) The semi-temperate regions round the slopes of Kilimanjaro (19,340 feet) and Meru (14,979 feet) to the north of the Territory, the "Winter Highlands" further west, the Usambara and Pare Highlands in the north-east, the Fipa Plateau in the south-west, and the mountainous areas to the north and east of Lake Nyasa (5,000 to 10,000 feet); frosts at higher altitudes, nights cold.

Generally speaking, the rainfall is low for a tropical country. Except for the northern and middle sections of the coastal belt, where the advent of the rain is dependent on the south-east and the north-east monsoon currents, and the areas around Lake Victoria and the north of Lake Nyasa—where there are two distinct rainy seasons—the greater part of the Territory has generally a one-season rainfall, beginning in November or December and continuing more or less unbrokenly to the end of April or May.

History

The country now known as Tanganyika came under German influence largely through the initiative of Dr. Karl Peters. In 1884 he journeyed into the interior and concluded twelve treaties with chiefs whose chiefdoms were then declared to be German territory. In 1885 the land he had acquired was placed under the protection of the Imperial German Government. A ten-mile belt along the coast was regarded as belonging to Zanzibar, but in 1888 Germany acquired the right of collecting duties on the coast and in 1890 took over the coastal strip on payment of £200,000 to the Sultan of Zanzibar. For some time after their acquisition of the territory the Germans were engaged in quelling risings, and in 1905 there broke out a serious rebellion, known as the "maji-maji" rising, in the southern areas and extending from Lake Nyasa in the interior to Kilwa on the coast.

Soon after the outbreak of the 1914–18 war clashes took place between British and German forces on the northern frontier of the Territory, but the serious attempt to occupy the country did not begin until 1916. By the end of that year all the country north of the Central Railway was occupied by British or Belgian forces and a provisional Civil Administration was established for that area on the 1st January, 1917. In November 1917 the German forces were driven across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa and the occupation of the whole of the Territory was then completed. By the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles in 1919, Germany renounced in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her overseas possessions, including her East African colony. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that His Britannic Majesty should exercise a mandate to administer this former German colony, except for the areas of Ruanda and Urundi, for which the mandate was given to the Belgian Government. In 1920 the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Territory was constituted. Since then the administration of the Territory has continued to be carried out under the terms of the mandate until the establishment of the Trusteeship System under the Charter of the United Nations.

Constitution

The basis of the administration of the Territory in international constitutional law is the Trusteeship Agreement approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946. The basis of the administration in demotic constitutional law is in Orders in Council under the United Kingdom Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890.

The Territory is administered by the Governor assisted by an Executive Council consisting of 15 members, of whom nine are Ministers (at present all officials) and six are unofficials. Three of the Ministers sit as ex officio members, while the remaining six Ministers and six unofficial members are nominated.

In 1957 the Legislative Council Elections Ordinance was passed. The Territory is divided into ten constituencies and elections are to be held in five of the constituencies in 1958 and in the remainder in 1959.

The Legislative Council, which is presided over by a Speaker, consists of 67 members, 34 of whom form the Government side and the remaining 33 the Representative side. The Government side consists of three ex officio Ministers, six nominated Ministers and six nominated Assistant Ministers. All the Assistant Ministers are unofficials. The remaining 19 members on the Government side are for the most part nominated unofficials (including the six unofficial members of Executive Council) with a small number of nominated heads of departments. The racial division of the members representing constituencies is ten Africans, ten Asians and ten Europeans, at present nominated but soon to be elected, one of each race to represent each of the ten constituencies. There are also three members (one of each race) representing general territorial interests.

Land Policy

Subject to the validity of any title to land or any interest therein lawfully acquired before the 26th January, 1923, the whole of the lands of the Territory, whether occupied or unoccupied on that date, were declared to be public lands under the control of and subject to the disposition of the Governor, to be held and administered by him
for the use and common benefit, direct or indirect, of the natives of the Territory. No title to the occupation and use of any such lands is valid without the consent of the Governor who, in the exercise of his powers, is obliged to have regard to native laws and customs. The only grants of freehold title which the Governor may make over public land are grants to give effect to a contract or undertaking by the former German Government, certain grants by way of exchange for freehold land acquired by the Governor, and grants to the Board of Trustees of the Tanganyika Higher Education Trust Fund. The Governor may, where it appears to him to be in the general interests of the Territory, make grants of Rights of Occupancy over public land to both native and non-native persons for terms not exceeding 99 years and subject to the payment of a suitable rental, revisable at intervals of not more than thirty-three years. Land lawfully used or occupied by a native or native community in accordance with native law and custom is deemed to be held on a Right of Occupancy.

Taxation

The tax system includes indirect taxation in the form of import, export and excise duties, stamp duties, and miscellaneous licence fees.

Particulars of direct taxation are set out below.

(a) Personal Tax is payable by all males over 18, irrespective of race: the rates are related to an individual's chargeable income. The minimum and maximum rates payable per annum are Shs. 12/- and Shs. 180/- respectively.

(b) Non-Native Education Tax is payable by every male non-native over 18 resident in the Territory, and assessed on tax payable.

(c) Municipal House Tax is levied on owners of houses in townships, not including native dwellings, at rates not exceeding 15% of the net annual value of the house. The tax is not leviable in those townships where local rates are in force.

(d) Estate Duty is payable at graduated rates on any deceased estate of a value exceeding £100.

(e) Income Tax.—Resident individuals pay Shs. 1/50 on each £ of the first £400 of chargeable income; where this exceeds £400, upon the whole chargeable income at the rate of Shs. 1/50 in the £ with the addition of one-eighth of a cent for every £ of chargeable income in excess of £400 up to a total of £1,572, at which point the rate is Shs. 3/- in the £. Where the chargeable income exceeds £1,572 the tax payable increases by Shs. 5/- for each £ in excess of £1,572. Where the total income exceeds £2,000 a surtax is payable of Sh. -/25 cents, increasing by one-eighth of a cent up to a total income of £3,500, and thereafter by one-twentieth of a cent up to a total income of £8,456. Where total income is in excess of £8,456 surtax payable increases by Shs. 9/- for each £ of total income in excess of £8,456.

Non-resident individuals pay at the rate of Shs. 2/- where chargeable income does not exceed £800. Where it exceeds £800 the rate is the same as for residents.

The income of individuals is subject to their personal allowances.

Limited companies pay at the rate of Shs. 5/- in the £.

Currency notes are issued in the following denominations: Sh. 5/-, Sh. 10/-, Sh. 20/-, Sh. 100/- and Sh. 1,000/-.

Development Plans

Since 1948 there has been a steady rate of development and it is anticipated that this development will continue at a rate of £4 million per annum of capital expenditure. The following figures are of interest in illustrating the development which has taken place in the past eight years:

| Year     | Amount       |
|----------|--------------|
| 1949     | 1,687,000    |
| 1950     | 3,438,000    |
| 1951     | 3,830,000    |
| 1952     | 5,009,310    |
| 1953     | 3,699,000    |
| 1954 (First six months) | 1,600,785 |
| 1955     | 3,657,997    |
| 1956-57  | 6,480,956    |
These funds come from a variety of sources but the main items are Loan Funds, Colonial Development and Welfare grants and contributions from Tanganyika Revenue.

The new development plan covering the period 1955-60 envisages expenditure of nearly £26,000,000 19% of which will be devoted to the development of natural resources, 30% to communications, 12½% to urban development and 20% to social services. Colonial Development and Welfare funds will provide some £4½ million towards this programme.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation's wattle plantations in the Njombe district now extend over an area of 33,000 acres.

The modified programme pursued by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation lays stress on such crops as velvet beans, soya beans, millet, and tobacco, in addition to groundnuts. Ranching is being undertaken at Kongwa and in an area near the Ruvu River some 50 miles west of Dar es Salaam.

Work on the deep water berths at Mtwara and on the Southern Province railway has been completed, and the deep water berths at Dar es Salaam are now being used by shipping. The improvement of harbour facilities at Tanga has been completed.

Following on a preliminary reconnaissance by an F.A.O. expert in 1953, a survey of the Rufiji basin is being undertaken by the Tanganyika Agriculture Corporation, on behalf of the Tanganyika Government, assisted by a team of F.A.O. experts. The whole project is being financed mainly from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The object of the survey is to lay down the main lines of the development of the basin and to ensure that such development as is immediately possible is in line with the overall scheme.

The Mbeya Exploration Company, financed jointly by the Dutch firm of Billiton and the Colonial Development Corporation, has been granted a mining lease over the large pyrochlore deposits at Panda Hill in the Mbeya District in the Southern Highlands Province. A pilot mill is being erected for treatment tests of the ore of which large reserves have been proved.

The Kiabakari gold mine in the Musoma district owned by Tangold Mining Co., a company financed jointly by New Consolidated Gold Fields and the Corporation, is being developed, and by a drilling campaign the Corporation has proved a coal-field in the Kivira-Songwe area of the Rungwe District.

Education

Facilities for higher education are provided by the University College of Makerere at Kampala, Uganda, and at the Royal Technical College of East Africa, Nairobi. There are 180 students from Tanganyika at Makerere and 38 at the Royal Technical College.

There are about 297 students from Tanganyika receiving post-secondary education in the United Kingdom at the present time.

The system of African education provides for three stages up to secondary level; the Primary School Standards I-IV, the Middle School V-VIII and the Secondary School IX-XIII inclusive. In 1956 the number of pupils attending schools was as follows: Primary pupils 336,079; Middle school pupils 32,845; Secondary pupils 2,409; Teacher Training Centres 2,254; Technical and vocational training 1,962.

In 1956, eight Government Primary Schools, 16 assisted schools, six unaided schools, together with a Government Correspondence Course, gave primary education to 2,061 European children and 332 received secondary education at one Government school and one assisted school, while about 585 received grants towards the cost of secondary education outside the territory.

Indian pupils numbering 14,461 attended three Government, 114 assisted and one unassisted primary school; and 5,586 Indians received secondary education at four Government and 31 assisted schools. Another 989 non-Africans received primary education, and 263 secondary education, at assisted schools for other non-Africans including Goans.

Expenditure on educational services during 1956-57 (excluding £1,025,942 spent on capital works) amounted to £3,028,049. This total includes contributions amounting to £177,117 from Local Authorities and expenditure met from Non-Native Education Authority funds amounting to £740,850. In 1935 the total expenditure was £81,100.

Libraries

In Dar es Salaam there are the King George V Museum Library, the Arnaoutoglu Library which caters for all races and contains books in English, Swahili and Arabic, The British Council Library, and the High Court Library, which is open to all members of the Legal Department, to other serving officers of the Colonial Legal Service and to Advocates who have been admitted to practice in Her Majesty's High Court of Tanganyika and courts subordinate thereto.

The East African Literature Bureau runs postal and Book Box Services throughout the territory for African readers and the Social Development Department of the Tanganyika Government runs a combined book and cinema van and libraries at various community centres to serve Africans outside Dar es Salaam. In addition various schools, clubs and other institutions have libraries in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere.

Health

There are 565 out-patient dispensaries maintained by Native Authorities, four by Government, 110 by grant-earning missions and 268 by private bodies and industry. The Native Authorities maintain 162 maternity and child health clinics, Government 84 and missions 151. There are 18 major leprosaria of which some are maintained by Government and some by grant-aided missions. Government, missions and industrial concerns maintain a total of 197 hospitals and bedded dispensaries with 12,152 beds. During 1956, 240,928 in-patients and 13,134,882 out-patients were treated at Government and mission hospitals and dispensaries, and at Native Authority dispensaries.

Total estimated expenditure on medical and allied services in 1956-57 was £1,817,027. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £193,930. These figures exclude such items as medical building works provided for in the Public Works estimates and public health measures undertaken by the various township authorities or the expenditure on medical services by industry and voluntary agencies.
Communications

The main airport is Dar es Salaam which has full customs and other facilities, and is designed to take aircraft up to Britannia class. Customs facilities are available on a request basis at Kigoma, Tabora, Mtwara, Mbeya and Tanga.

East African Airways Corporation operate scheduled services into Arusha, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilwa, Lindi, Mafia, Mombo, Mpanda, Mwanza, Nachingwea, Njombe, Songea and Sao Hill. In addition, Dominicair aircraft operate scheduled services into Bukoba, Geita and Musoma.

Kigoma, Kongwa, Mwadui, Seronera and Urambo are capable of taking Dakota aircraft, but are not at present served by scheduled services.

There are, in addition, thirty-one minor aerodromes or landing grounds. Three are privately owned, and three are maintained for the International Red Locust Control Service.

East African Airways Corporation provide services connecting Tanganyika with the main centres of Kenya, Uganda and Zanzibar and Regional Services to the Central African Territories, Portuguese East Africa and South Africa using Dakota and Canadair Aircraft.

The Central African Airways Corporation operate Regional Services between the Central African Territories and Tanganyika with Viking and Viscount aircraft, and a Beaver Service between Nyasaland and Mbeya.

S.A.B.E.N.A. operate a weekly Dakota service between the Belgian Congo and Dar es Salaam.

East African Airways Corporation operate a weekly Canadair service connecting Dar es Salaam to London.

A number of small charter aircraft are based at Dar es Salaam and at Mwanza on Lake Victoria.

Air Navigational Services controlled by the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation, with a Regional Office in Dar es Salaam, are available at eleven aerodromes.

Meteorological Services are supplied by the East African Meteorological Department, with a Regional Office in Dar es Salaam.

The railways of the Territory are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission").

There are 490 miles of roads in townships, 135 in other settlements, 3,517 miles of trunk roads, 4,319 miles of local main roads, 10,934 miles of district roads and approximately 8,000 miles of village roads.

Six shipping lines operate services from and to Europe and South Africa, two lines operate services to India and South Africa, one line operates to Portuguese East Africa, two lines operate from Europe to and from Indonesia, six lines operate services to and from the United States of America, one line to and from France and Madagascar, one line between Germany and East Africa, one line between Australia, New Zealand and East Africa, and one line between East Canada and East Africa. Coastal services between Tanganyika, Kenya and Zanzibar are operated by six lines.

Passenger and freight services are operated on Lakes Tanganyika and Victoria by the East African Railways and Harbours Administration and on Lake Nyasa by Nyasaland Railways Limited. These steamer services connect the railways of Tanganyika with those of Kenya and Uganda and the transport systems of the Belgian Congo, Ruanda Urundi and Northern Rhodesia.

Broadcasting

The Tanganyika Broadcasting Service was handed over on the 1st July, 1956 to an Independent Statutory Corporation which has full authority to develop the Service as it sees fit. The project, however, is still financed by means of a subvention from Government funds. Licences cost 10/- and in the first six months of 1957, 16,691 were issued. The transmitters (1·25kW, 0·25kW and 20kW) and studios are in Dar es Salaam.

Principal Occupations

Most of the self-employed indigenous inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. The numbers of African adult males employed (at a census held during the third quarter of 1956) are classified in the following major industrial groups:
