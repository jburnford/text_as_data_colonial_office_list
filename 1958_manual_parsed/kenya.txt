KENYA

Area

The territory comprised under the name of "Kenya Colony and Protectorate," previously known as the East African Protectorate, includes parts of the great African Lakes, Victoria and Rudolf; the land area is approximately 219,730 square miles and the water area 5,230 square miles, making a total of 224,960 square miles.

Population

At 1st July, 1957, the total population of the Colony and Protectorate was estimated at some 6·3 million persons, of whom 6·0 million were Africans. The numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate is as follows:

| Tribe     | Per cent. (1948 census) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Kikuyu    | 19·5                   |
| Luo       | 14·4                   |
| Baluhya   | 12·5                   |
| Kamba     | 11·7                   |
| Meru      | 6·2                    |
| Nyika     | 5·6                    |

The 1948 census showed a total non-African population of 154,846 of whom 90,528 were Indians, 29,660 Europeans and 24,174 Arabs. The non-African population in mid-1957 has been estimated at 262,000.

Geographical Features

Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Teita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Kulal 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,120). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30–40 miles wide and 2,000–3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

Climate

The climate varies greatly. Three broad divisions exist:

1. The coast and its immediate hinterland;
2. The low plain, 300–2,000 feet, extending from the borders of the Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia to the boundary of Tanganyika.
3. The Highlands, 3,000–10,000 feet.

History

The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which supersedes the original agreement of 1908.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £10,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1887 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891), and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland...
dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

**Constitution**

Under additional Royal Instructions dated 13th April, 1954, as amended by further Instructions dated 7th November, 1956, there was set up a Council of Ministers, consisting of the Deputy Governor and eight *ex officio* and eight appointed Ministers, as follows: the Chief Secretary, the Minister for Legal Affairs, the Minister for Finance and Development, the Minister for African Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Water Resources, the Minister for Internal Security and Defence, the Minister for Local Government, Health and Housing, the Minister for Education, Labour and Lands, the Minister for Forest Development, Game and Fisheries, the Minister for Commerce and Industry, the Minister for Works, the Minister for Community Development, a European Minister without portfolio and an Asian Minister without portfolio. Two further Ministers have still to be appointed.

The Executive Council consists of the Ministers and such other persons, who are styled Appointed Members, as may be appointed by the Governor. There are at present two such Appointed Members, one African and one Arab.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor who is President, a Vice-President who is Speaker and 58 Members of whom eight are *ex officio* (Ministers), 18 Nominated Members (who all accept the Government whip on major issues of policy), 14 European Elected Members (of whom three have ministerial functions), six Asian Elected Members (of whom two have ministerial functions), one Arab Elected Member, eight African Elected Members and one Arab Representative Member (who is also a Parliamentary Secretary). There are also two unofficial members nominated from names submitted by the Board of Commerce and Industry and the Board of Agriculture. These arrangements are being revised during 1958. Twelve new non-communal seats are being created and six new African communal seats. A Council of State is being appointed to scrutinize legislation differentiating between the several communities.

In the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly Kenya is represented by two Nominated and six Unofficial Members, two of the latter being European, two Asian, and two African.

By the Kenya Protectorate Order in Council, 1920, it was provided that the Governor of the Colony should be Governor of the Protectorate, that the Executive Council of the Colony should be deemed to be the Executive Council of the Protectorate, and that it should be lawful for the Legislative Council of the Colony to legislate for the Protectorate. The Supreme Court is situated at Nairobi, and sessions are also held at Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu, Nyeri and various other places.

A General Election was held in September and October, 1956, for the European, Asian and Arab constituencies. In March, 1957, elections were held for the eight African members who were previously styled Representative members.

The African District Councils Ordinance, 1950, conferred on African local government bodies similar powers to those exercised by other Local Authorities. There are now 26 African District Councils exercising powers of raising their own revenues by rates, engaging staff, undertaking works and promoting the welfare of the inhabitants within their areas. They also possess powers of passing local by-laws regulating health, agriculture, law and order, public works, etc. The Local Government (County Councils) Ordinance, 1952, enables District Councils in the settled areas to prepare schemes for organizing the local government of their area into a County Council. Seven County Councils have now been created; two counties include a municipality each; five townships established under the Townships Ordinance, which had achieved self-accounting status, have been absorbed in counties as urban districts.

In addition there are four other municipalities established under the Municipalities Ordinance, including the City Council of Nairobi which received a Royal Charter in 1950. There are two self-accounting townships established under the Townships Ordinance which have not been incorporated into any county scheme of local government.

In October, 1952, a State of Emergency was declared in Kenya. The Government then assumed special powers in order to maintain law and order in the face of a campaign of violence and barbarous atrocity engineered, principally amongst the Kikuyu, by the Mau Mau secret society.

**Land Policy**

All land in Kenya, apart from a few freeholds, mainly around Nairobi and in the Protectorate, falls into one of two categories:

(a) Crown lands.

(b) Native lands.

"Crown lands" include not only the Highlands but also native leasehold areas, native reserves, temporary native reserves and native settlement areas.

"Native lands" are permanently reserved for Africans in so far as the occupation, use, control, inheritance, succession and disposal of the land are concerned and all the rights enjoyed under native laws and custom are preserved.

Crown land within a municipality or township, even in the Highlands, may be alienated to persons of any race for not more than 99 years. Crown land in the Highlands, outside a municipality, township or native reserve, may be alienated to Europeans only, except by consent of the Highlands Board, on 999-year leases in the case of agricultural land.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation which apply to all communities are income tax and personal tax. The maximum rate of personal tax in 1958 will be Shs. 150/-. Under the Income Tax Acts generous personal allowances are given and the rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 1/30 in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, and increases on a graduated scale to Shs. 11/- in the £ on incomes exceeding £50,000 per annum. In addition, a surcharge of 75 cents is made on each £ of chargeable income in excess of £800. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/– in the £. A graduated hospital tax calculated on total income is also payable by all Europeans.

The Public Debt of Kenya at 30th June, 1956, was £47,207,201, made up as follows:

- Funded Debt: £38,555,600 (of which £6,696,091 was raised for E.A. Railways and Harbours Administration).
- Unfunded Debt: £8,651,601 (of which £3,000,000 was an interest free loan from H.M. Government to assist with Emergency expenditure).

Currency

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board in London on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also British Somaliland and Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coining of the following denominations: 5 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-, Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-, and Shs. 1/- notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is inter-changeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

Under the ten-year Development Programme 1946–55, £38·8 million was allocated, of which £27·4 million was spent over the eight years 1946–53. Of this expenditure 45% was financed from loans, 24% from Colony revenue and 18% from various appropriated funds.

A new Development Programme covered the three and a half years, 1954–57, during which £21·7 million was spent, mainly from loan money, the balance in the Development Fund, and Colonial Development and Welfare grants. Other development expenditure outside the three-and-a-half-year programme amounted to £13·8 million during the same planning period, making a total of £35·5 million in all.

A further Development Programme is now in force for the three years 1957–60, under which it is proposed to bring all important development projects within the plan and spend £26·3 million as follows:

| Ministry                                      | Per cent |

During the planning period, 1954–57, it was estimated that £4·0 million was spent on the Swynnerton Plan to Intensify the Development of African Agriculture. During the period 1957–60 it is proposed to allocate £6·7 million to the Swynnerton and Accelerated Swynnerton Plans, of which £1·3 million will be the balance of the original £5·0 million allocated as a Colonial Development and Welfare grant for the Swynnerton Plan, 1954–59.

Education (1956)—African

The number of African post-primary, secondary and post-secondary institutions was 77, with an enrolment of 4,435 males and 1,082 females. Of these institutions 25 were run by Government.
with an enrolment of 1,965 males and 108 females; and 50 were aided, with 2,420 males and 974 females. Two were unaided, with 50 males.

There were 3,524 primary and intermediate schools with 443,864 pupils. Of these, 25 were run by Government, with an enrolment of 1,548 boys and 214 girls; 2,873 were aided with 294,623 boys and 108,729 girls; and 626 were unaided, with 30,620 boys and 8,130 girls.

Asian Education

The number of schools providing secondary education was 20 (10 Government, 8 aided and 2 unaided) with a total enrolment of 5,570, of whom 1,140 were in aided and 597 in unaided schools.

The number of schools providing primary education was 119 (25 Government, 85 aided and 9 unaided), with a total enrolment of 34,572, of whom 17,395 were in aided and 542 in unaided schools.

Of the total enrolment of 40,142 in all schools, 22,011 were boys and 18,131 were girls.

There are three Government Teacher Training Colleges for Asian students. The enrolment at the end of 1956 was 76 males and 114 females.

European Education

The number of schools providing secondary education was 13 (5 Government, 1 aided and 7 unaided) with a total enrolment of 2,539 of whom 1,842 were in Government schools, 161 in the aided school, and 556 in unaided schools; six of the secondary schools have primary sections (included below). Schools providing primary education numbered 46 (15 Government, 16 aided and 15 unaided) with a total enrolment of 7,200 pupils, of whom 4,686 were in Government schools, 892 in aided schools and 1,622 in unaided schools.

Arab and Other Races Education

There is one Government secondary school for boys, with an enrolment of 145. Eight Government primary schools had an enrolment of 1,655 boys and 642 girls, and one aided primary school had an enrolment of 171 boys and 23 girls.

Higher Education

In 1957, 71 Kenya students were admitted to Makerere College in Uganda making a total of 251 in all from Kenya in residence.

The Royal Technical College of East Africa was opened in Nairobi in April, 1956. There are Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Science, Engineering and Commerce and a Department of Domestic Science; 208 Kenya students have been admitted, of whom 91 enjoy bursaries, and 5 Asian Teachers' Scholarships.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education, usually in institutions overseas. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students in going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Government of India, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for Study and Training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

In addition to these awards a new scheme has been started to assist in the higher education of Government servants which provides "Kenya Development Scholarships", open to Kenya Government servants of all races recommended by the Heads of their Departments, to pursue courses which will either improve their capacity as Government servants or fit them for promotion. In 1956-57, six Government servants were sent to the United Kingdom on a wide variety of courses.

A new Educational Trust was formed by a private donor called the Maunten and Mohammedally Rattansi Educational Trust. In the terms of the Trust the income is divided into five equal parts for awards annually to Europeans, Africans, Muslims, non-Muslims and Ismailis. Twenty awards were made from this Trust to students of all races for studies in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere.

The total number of Kenya students in the United Kingdom for the academic session 1956-57 was 731. This number included 83 Africans (47 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 453 Asians (65 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), and 187 Europeans (52 with bursaries, scholarships or loans). There were 153 Africans in India during this period, 20 in the United States, and 8 in various other countries.

Trade and Technical Education

There were, in 1957, four Government Technical and Trade Schools for African boys admitting students who had completed eight years of schooling for a three or four-year course of training; in 1957, 907 indentured apprentices were receiving instruction in building, engineering, tailoring and leather-working trades. Seventy-nine pupils who had completed one year of a trade course are taking a Secondary Technical course leading to the School Certificate examination. Twenty-eight pupils were admitted for a clerical course.

Vocational training was also given in two aided schools and at a number of unaided rural training centres. A number of Government Departments, East African Railways and Harbours and the Posts and Telegraphs Administrations, conducted training courses for students from the intermediate and secondary schools entering their service.

The Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education, which ranks as a Technical Institute, had 150 students enrolled in 1957.

There were two Asian Technical High Schools providing courses in technical and commercial subjects to School Certificate standard with 755 pupils on the roll.

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library and the Desai Memorial Library, both in Nairobi, and also the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. The Government has a small library of general reference books and books on Africa.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Curator, Dr. L. S. B. Leakey, is
assisted by a staff of eight Europeans and eighteen Africans, with part-time assistance from two other Europeans.

Health

In 1956 beds available in hospitals (including maternity homes but excluding beds in dispensaries and health centres) totalled 7,811. (Government 6,005, Local Authorities 97, Missions 1,173, private 536). In-patients in Government Hospitals totalled 173,277, out-patients 1,313,041.

Total expenditure of the Medical Department on Hospital and Health Services in the fiscal year 1956 was £1,623,932 compared with £435,942 in 1946.

Communications

Eastleigh airport, Nairobi, is the main aerodrome used by international services. Internal scheduled services operated by East African Airways Corporation are based on Nairobi West and operate services in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret and Kitale as well as connecting the services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of charter aircraft operating companies are based at Nairobi West.

With the opening of the new international Nairobi Airport in 1958, however, Eastleigh Airport will cease to operate, and all international services as well as East African Airways Corporation's internal services will operate from the new Airport. Nairobi West Airport will remain open for use by charter companies and private owners.

Air Safety and Aeradio Services are provided by the Directorate of Civil Aviation, East Africa, and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. All air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the East Africa High Commission.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Belgian Congo, Aden and Madagascar.

There are approximately 22,000 miles of roads; only about 364 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads (2,800 miles, excluding Northern Frontier Province), where not bituminized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (4,483 miles) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. Considerable improvements in alignment and formation have been effected on the main roads, and many secondary roads, during recent years. The Great North Road (Cape Town to Cairo) through Kenya, from Namanga on the Tanganyika border in the south and via Nairobi, has been re-routed through Eldoret to Tororo on the Uganda border.

(See also under "East Africa High Commission" for Railways and Harbours, Road, Air and Postal and Telegraph Services.)

Broadcasting

Kenya was the first British Colonial Territory to have a regular public wireless broadcasting service. There are now two broadcasting stations in Nairobi (6 kW transmitters), and smaller regional stations in Mombasa (600 W), Kisumu (600 W), and Nyeri (200 W). Services in English and Asian languages are provided by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited from Nairobi, while the second Nairobi station, operated by the Department of Information of the Kenya Government, broadcasts to African listeners in Swahili and Kikamba. The Charter granted to Cable and Wireless Limited in 1931 expired in September 1956, but by an agreement with the company and the Government, the Cable and Wireless stations will continue English and Asian broadcasts for a further three years from that date.

Outside Nairobi, the Department of Information operates three regional stations for African listeners. That at Nyeri broadcasts in Kikuyu for a total of six hours daily, while those at Kisumu and Mombasa, both of which are on the air for five hours a day, broadcast to the people of Nyanza and the Upper Rift Valley and the Coast Province respectively.

The national African service from Nairobi, which operates under the name of the African Broadcasting Service, broadcasts for six and a quarter hours daily. The programmes are fed by land line to the Cable and Wireless transmitting station on the outskirts of the City, where the transmitters for this service, owned by the Government, are maintained by the company.

At present there are more than 27,000 licensed receiving sets in the Colony, and there are wired broadcasting schemes in operation in Nairobi and Nakuru, with 225 subscribers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and Rudolf Lakes. Many Africans in the Highlands also own forest plantations. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1956 are shown in the following table:

| Industry                        | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|--------------------------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing | 233,097  | 384    | 1,666     |
| Mining and Quarrying            | 8,688    | 205    | 7         |
| Manufacturing and Repairs       | 46,019   | 6,916  | 2,521     |
| Building and Construction       | 25,264   | 3,579  | 59        |
| Commerce                        | 22,624   | 9,614  | 3,690     |

| All Industries and Services     | 540,169  | 35,504 | 21,094    |

In December, 1956, 21 employees' and employers' unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total paid-up membership of the employees' unions was about 17,500.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, wattle extract, cotton, butter, hides and skins, maize and wheat.

Beef production, dairying, sheep, pigs and poultry play an important part in the Colony's agricultural policy and under the impetus of the Swynnerton Plan, African farmers are beginning to make a big contribution to the agricultural production of Kenya.
The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as *Podocarpus* and pencil cedar and hardwoods such as East African olive and camphor. Forest produce from the established plantations is becoming available in increasing quantities and already provides some 22% of the annual softwoods production of the Colony, as well as considerable numbers of poles. The annual yield of mangrove poles from the coastal areas is in the region of 800,000.

Fishing is carried on both on the coast and in Lake Victoria and apart from seasonal shortages, an adequate supply is obtained for local consumption.

The chief minerals in order of value covering the year 1956 were soda ash, cement (from local minerals), salt, gold, diatomite, limestone products, carbon dioxide gas, graphite, silver and gypsum. The total value of minerals won during 1956 was £3,770,832.

There are in operation in the Colony over 100 main types of manufacturing and industrial concerns which produce goods both for internal consumption and export. The chief products are:

- Acetylene, aluminium hollow-ware, bacon and pork products, biscuits, butter, beer, canned foodstuffs, carbon dioxide and dry ice, cheese, coffee, cement, cigarettes, diatomite products, dried milk, essential oils, fancy leather goods, footwear, folding spring beds, furniture and joinery, glassware and bottles, hydrogenated oils, hides and skins, hurricane lanterns, kyanite, metal containers, preserved fruit and fruit preparations, passion fruit juice and pulp, pineapple juice, parquet flooring blocks, pyrethrum extract, pencil slats, sisal products, soda ash, tea, tanned leather, wattle extract and bark and meerschaum pipes.

An ever-increasing export trade is enjoyed by African curios and carvings which command a ready market in the United Kingdom, United States, Mexico, Canada, and Australia.
