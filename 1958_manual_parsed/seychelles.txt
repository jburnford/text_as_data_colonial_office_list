SEYCHELLES

Area
The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156½ square miles.

Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to cover 55½ square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.

Population
The estimate at 30th June, 1956, was 40,417.
Principal Town

Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 9,000.

Geographical Features

The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif, and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate

In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the 54 years to 1956 was 90-87 inches and the mean temperature was 82°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.

History

The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahé in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May, 1794, when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Isle de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.

Constitution

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, three official members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized, but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. Residents are eligible for the following personal allowances:

| Earned income | Rs. 1,500 |
|---------------|-----------|
| Personal (single) | Rs. 500 |
| Personal (married) | Rs. 2,000 |
| Child | Rs. 500 (max. Rs. 2,500) |

Rates of tax chargeable after deduction of allowances are:

- 2½% on first Rs. 3,000 taxable income.
- 5% on next Rs. 3,000 then increasing by 2½% for each Rs. 1,000 of taxable income up to Rs. 15,000.
- Rs. 15,000–Rs. 25,000, 30%.
- Rs. 25,000–Rs. 40,000, 40%.
- All taxable income over Rs. 40,000, 50%.

Companies pay a flat rate of 30%.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

* The figures from 1953 exclude C.D. and W. moneys.

In 1956, Rs. 1,406,458 (37%) of revenue was derived from Customs and Rs. 1,206,672 (31%) from direct taxes. The largest heads of expenditure were: Medical Rs. 723,608 (17%); Education Rs. 574,443 (13%); Agriculture Rs. 395,406 (9%).
Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Notes of 1 rupee and 50 cents are however being gradually withdrawn from circulation. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d.

Development Plans

The total expenditure planned over the Development period 1956–1961 is estimated at some Rs. 2,500,000.

The main heads of proposed expenditure are:

| Head                        | Rs.     |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Agriculture-Forestry        | 251,000 |
| Education                   | 354,000 |
| Village Settlement          | 132,000 |
| Road Development            | 637,700 |
| Land Settlement             | 646,690 |

The Colonial Development and Welfare Fund has provided grants to finance the above schemes totalling Rs. 2,266,667 and the difference will be met by contribution from the Colony’s revenue.

Education

There are 34 primary schools, 2 secondary modern schools, 2 secondary grammar schools, 2 trade training centres, 3 pupil teacher centres, and a teacher-training centre. Continuation classes are also held.

There are 2,765 boys and 2,609 girls in the primary schools and 201 boys and 219 girls in the secondary schools. The professional teacher-training course provides the only higher education in the Colony. Twenty-six students are studying in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education in 1956 was Rs. 661,612 of which Rs. 87,186 was from United Kingdom funds. Expenditure in 1935 was Rs. 27,528.

Libraries

There are no Free Libraries. Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust, with a small branch at Anse Royale, and there are small libraries run by the Co-operative Book Society, the French Consulate, and the Roman Catholic Mission.

Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has very few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent and filariasis is infrequent. The incidence of leprosy is diminishing. As a result of the recent anti-V.D. campaign, syphilis and chancroid have come under complete control. Tuberculosis, which is rather more frequent than had been previously thought, is also receiving attention. Incidence in 1956 was 121.

Incidence of intestinal worms and amoebiasis continues high and a programme for improving sanitation in Victoria has been drawn up. A separate Public Health Section under the supervision of a Medical Officer of Health was created in 1956. This section works in close co-operation with the World Health Organization team in the joint project of environmental sanitation and health education.

The Colony is divided into eight districts, each under the charge of one Health Inspector. Five Public Health Nurses are so distributed that their activities cover the whole Colony.

There are infant welfare, antenatal and V.D. clinics at several centres on Mahé and Praslin and also on La Digue. An immunization centre at Victoria deals with yellow fever, diphtheria, T.A.B. and other inoculations. Dental facilities are available daily in Victoria, weekly at Anse Royale and fortnightly at Beolierre.

A School Health Service was established in 1957, and covers all the schools in the Colony. School follow-up clinics are also arranged by the Public Health Nurses for the instruction of parents. Immunization of infants against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus was started in 1957 in all the infant welfare clinics.

| Total                            | 5,304       | 52,431      |

Expenditure on medical services in 1956 was Rs. 723,608. In 1935 expenditure was Rs. 72,682.

Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15–20 feet, earth-surfaced. Tarmac surfacing is in progress in Victoria and suburbs.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 55 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé, and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. British India Steam Navigation Company and Eastern Shipping Corporation both have passenger vessels on the Bombay-Mombasa service which call at Seychelles once each way every two months. Direct loading cargo steamers from the United Kingdom call quarterly.

Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and wired broadcasting) Station at Victoria Road, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for one hour on a wavelength of 60·2 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 40 W. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

No receiving licences are issued.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 20,000 are so employed. Other occupations in 1956 were:

| Occupation                  | Number |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Domestic service            | 2,985  |
| Artisans                    | 2,380  |
| Public administration       | 510    |
| Trade and commerce          | 375    |
There are three registered Trade Unions—

(1) The Stevedores and Lighterage Workers' Union (membership 31).
(2) The Seychelles Building Trades Union (membership 168).
(3) The General Workers' Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

The livestock population is estimated at:—
cattle 2,000; pigs 2,000; goats 1,000; poultry 40,000.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000-1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered, copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production has commenced.

History

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

Constitution

That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

Royal Instructions of 1956 provided for an Executive Council of four ex officio members and not less than four unofficial members, to be styled Minister, from the elected members of the House of Representatives. As a result of these instructions nine Ministers, including a Chief Minister holding the Portfolio of Internal Affairs and Development, were appointed in May 1957.

The Sierra Leone (House of Representatives) Order in Council, 1956, provided for the replace-
