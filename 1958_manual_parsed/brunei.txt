Geographical Features
Brunei has a coastline of about 100 miles, and is split into two and surrounded on the landward sides by Sarawak. In the west the valleys of the Belait and the Tutong rivers, representing more than half the area of the country, consist of extensive swamps gradually changing through a series of ridge and swamp formations into low hills at the sources of the rivers. The Labi hills in the extreme west cover an area of some 300 square miles and at no point exceed 1,300 feet in height. In the east the Brunei district is characterized by a number of steep rocky hills of no great height rising from alluvial flats, while Temburong, except near the coast, is hilly, becoming mountainous as one approaches Bukit Pagon, a spur from the main Bornean range.

Climate
There are no well-defined seasons, but the rainfall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle of January. The annual rainfall varies from 100 inches at the coast to over 200 inches in certain parts of the interior. The temperature rarely exceeds 90°; the usual daily range is between 76° and 86°.

History
The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the sixteenth century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the whole of the island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines. Towards the end of the sixteenth century its power began to decline, the outlying territories gradually fell away, and by the beginning of the nineteenth century the kingdom of Brunei had dwindled so as to include only what is now Sarawak and part of North Borneo.

At this period the town itself seems to have degenerated to the condition of a slave market for the sale of captives of Illanun and Sulu pirates. Anarchy was rife in the outlying districts, and in 1841 Sarawak proper was ceded to Mr. (later Sir James) Brooke in return for his services.
in quelling an insurrection at Kuching, and he was declared Rajah of Sarawak. In 1846 the island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain as a base for anti-piracy measures, and in 1877 the whole of the northern portion of Borneo was ceded to form the nucleus of what was to become British North Borneo. At various later dates further cessions were made to the Rajah of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company till the territories of the State were eventually reduced to their present circumscribed limits.

In 1847 the Sultan entered into a Treaty with Great Britain for the furtherance of commercial relations and the mutual suppression of piracy. An additional clause provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Brunei, which provision was modified by an Agreement of 1856. By a further Treaty made in 1888 Brunei was placed under the protection of Great Britain, and the Sultan agreed that the foreign relations of the State should be conducted by Her Majesty's Government. Provision was also made for the setting up of Consular Courts with jurisdiction over British subjects and foreign subjects enjoying British protection. In 1903-06 a supplementary Agreement was entered into whereby the Sultan undertook to accept a British officer, to be styled Resident, who should be the agent and representative of the British Government under the High Commissioner for the Malay States (at that time the Governor of the Straits Settlements). The Governor of Sarawak has been High Commissioner for Brunei since 1948.

**Constitution**

The supreme authority in the State is vested in the Sultan in Council. The State Council consists of eleven members, including the British Resident, with the Sultan as President. The assent of the Council is required for the enactment of legislation and important questions of policy are referred to it.

The general functions of administration are carried out by a British Resident under the supervision of the Governor of Sarawak as High Commissioner. By a Treaty of 1906 the Resident's advice must be asked and acted upon in all questions other than those affecting the Mohammediain religion. The seat of Government is in Brunei Town and there are Assistant Residents at Kuala Belait and at Headquarters.

**Land Policy**

In the State a transfer charge, lease or sub-lease of land to a person who is not a natural born subject of the Sultan, or who has not resided in the State for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years during the ten years immediately preceding the date on which such instrument is delivered to the Land Officer, shall be subject to, and shall not be valid or registered without, the approval of the Sultan in Council.

**Taxation**

At present there is no Income Tax upon persons other than Companies. Companies are taxed at the rate of 30% upon their chargeable income. Import, export and excise duties are charged. A royalty is paid by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, based upon the amount of oil produced. A variety of licences are issued, mostly of a municipal nature.

### Public Finance

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 1,179,979    | 1,476,725      |
| 1952 | 75,652,620   | 13,846,239     |

| 1956 | 118,294,880  | 29,915,273     |

In 1956 the main sources of revenue were:

- Customs: $4,300,330
- Income Tax: $54,360,279
- Mining Rents and Oil Royalties: $39,205,030

The main heads of expenditure in the same year were:

- Public Works Extraordinary: $22,080,705
- Miscellaneous services: $7,726,637
- Public Works Annually Recurrent: $2,848,555
- Medical and Health: $1,891,498

### Currency

The State is a party to the Malayan Currency Agreement and Malayan currency is the only legal tender.

The standard coin is the Malayan silver dollar with a par of 2s. 4d., at which it is linked to sterling. Subsidiary coins are those of value of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. There is also copper coin of 1 cent. Currency notes are issued in different denominations from 50 cents upwards.

### Development Plans

A sum of $100,000,000 was set aside by the State Council in August, 1954, for Development purposes. Expenditure on the plan by the end of 1956 had reached $40,784,573. By the end of 1956, the total sums earmarked were:

- Economic schemes and communications: $61,090,805
- Health, education and welfare: $27,975,200
- Administration and equipment: $4,908,200

On the economic side the main need of the State is for good road communications both to connect the capital with the large oilfield at Seria, and to open up new land for agricultural development; experiments are being conducted into the mechanical planting and harvesting of rice and loans are available from State funds on easy terms.

An old-age pensions scheme and pensions for dependants of the blind, lepers and lunatics were put into operation in 1955.

One of the most pressing needs of the State is for schools, and secondary schools at Seria, Kuala Belait and Brunei Town provided for under the plan are nearing completion. Five higher primary schools at the main centres are also nearing completion, and some 13 of the planned 26 rural primary schools are already occupied. In rural areas schoolchildren are supplied with a free meal, and in urban areas with a vitamin fortified skimmed milk drink.

Automatic telephone exchanges and V.H.F. radio telephones are in process of installation and the State water and electricity supplies are now sufficient to meet all expected demands.

A Medical Department plan provides for a modern hospital at Kuala Belait, which will also serve the needs of the Seria oilfield, and for a Tuberculosis and General Hospital in Brunei Town.
The re-building of devastated areas was completed in 1954.

**Education**

The number and type of institutions providing educational facilities are:

(a) 48 Malay Vernacular Schools, with a total enrolment of 4,663; 3,392 boys and 1,271 girls. These schools are fully maintained by Government. The Malay language is the medium of instruction; English is taught as a second language beginning in the Fourth Year.

(b) Chinese Schools, with a total enrolment of 3,082; 1,765 boys and 1,317 girls. These schools are maintained by subscriptions from the Chinese communities in the areas in which the schools are situated, by school fees and grants from Government which comprise 30% of recurrent costs and building grants. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, Limited, gives financial aid to the two Chinese Schools situated in the Oilfield area. The medium of instruction in all Chinese Schools is Chinese (Mandarin). English is taught as a second language from the First Year.

(c) English Schools. Government maintains two secondary schools in which the medium of instruction is English. Both have preparatory classes.

There are five Mission Schools, two S.P.G. and three Roman Catholic. The Mission Schools are largely maintained by Mission funds and school fees. All receive grants-in-aid from Government and those situated on the Oilfield receive financial aid from the Oil Company. One Mission School provides secondary education.

The total enrolment of these schools is: Primary Classes 974 boys, 678 girls, total 1,652; Secondary Classes 326 boys, 144 girls, total 470.

(d) One Trades School (Technical). This is maintained by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company Limited, Government contributing 19% of the operating cost to finance an apprenticeship scheme under which up to 20 Brunei boys are admitted to the school each year. The present total enrolment is 166: 68 first year, 37 second year and 61 third year. The practical instruction given includes:—Fitting, Motor and Diesel Mechanics, Welding and Blacksmithing. On the theoretical side are included Theory of Mechanics, Workshop practice, Electricity, Mathematics and Machine Drawings.

(e) There is one Teacher Training Centre which has an enrolment of 21 students. The medium of instruction is Malay, and English is taught as a subject.

The total enrolment in all schools for 1956 was 10,151.

Thirty-one Brunei students are attending educational institutions outside the State.

Recurrent expenditure on Education (both Government and other agencies) in 1956 was $2,829,545 compared with $36,059 in 1940 and $7,289 in 1930.

Non-recurrent expenditure in 1956 was $3,962,867, over 95% of this figure being spent on School Buildings and Equipment.

**Health**

Brunei State may be considered relatively healthy. The following diseases are of greatest incidence:

- Tropical Anaemias
- Helminthic Diseases
- Protein and Vitamin "A" Deficiency
- Tuberculosis
- Malaria

Of these it is considered that Tuberculosis is the greatest problem. Difficult socio-economic conditions retard attempts at eradication of disease. A Tuberculosis Clinic commenced work in 1953. Malaria has been kept under control and in some areas very markedly reduced.

There is one 150-bed State Hospital in Brunei Town, one 70-bed hospital in Kuala Belait and the Oil Company also has a 150-bed hospital there for its employees. There are two district dispensaries each of which has a ward with eight beds, and a system of road and river travelling dispensaries covers the whole State.

Hospital attendances for 1956 were as follows:

- Hospital in-patients ... 3,347
- Hospital out-patients ... 96,623
- Health Clinic attendances ... 24,365
- Travelling dispensary attendances 17,675

During 1956 the Medical Department budget amounted to $2,302,786, an increase of $89,550 over the previous year.

**Communications**

The principal airfield in the State is four miles outside Brunei Town. This was opened to small aircraft in November 1954 with a daily service connecting with Labuan and the oilfields, using Rapide aircraft.

Construction to international Code Letter "E" should be completed by 1958. The length will be 5,300 feet of paved surface. A direct service from Singapore via Kuching to Brunei Town, and on to Jesselton, using Dakotas, was inaugurated in October 1956.

The Anduki airfield is a private aerodrome operated by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, Limited, for their own use but aircraft of the local feeder service (Rapides) call there. The Company also maintain a light railway from Seria to Badas about eight miles long.

There are 246 miles of roads; bitumen surfaced 57 miles, metalled 32 miles, earth 90 miles, bridle paths 67 miles.

The main ports are Brunei Town and Kuala Belait. The bulk of general cargo for Brunei is transshipped from Singapore or Labuan and conveyed to the two main ports by coasting vessels run by the Straits Steamship Company. Weekly visits are made to the Port of Brunei Town direct from Singapore by this Company's vessels of up to 1,700 G.R.T. Cargo vessels started operating direct from Hong Kong to Brunei in 1955 and by 1957 this became virtually a weekly service. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company also maintains a considerable fleet of vessels, and these ply mainly between Brunei Town, Labuan and Kuala Belait. In addition, numerous native-owned motor launches, tongkangs and outboard motor boats carry on a coastal trade around the Brunei and adjacent Colonies' ports. The State runs a motor launch service connecting with the air service and, as far as possible, the steamer service in Labuan, carrying mail and passengers.
Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. Numbers employed in other occupations in 1956 were: Government service (Public Works) 2,248, oil mining 4,143, sawmilling and woodworking 532 and rubber 368.
