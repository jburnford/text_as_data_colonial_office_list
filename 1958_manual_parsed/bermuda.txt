BERMUDA
Situation and Area
The "Bermudas" or "Somers Islands" are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 580 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina. Until 1940 the Colony had an area of 18·83 square miles. As a result of work done by the
United States authorities to unite and extend some of the islands with materials dredged from the sea, their total area is now 20·69 square miles, of which 2·33 square miles are leased to the Government of the United States for naval and military bases, leaving 18·36 square miles available to the civil population. The United States Bases include a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

**Population**

The estimated civil population on the 31st December, 1956, was 42,040, of whom 15,759 were white and 26,281 coloured.

**Principal Towns**

The City of Hamilton, the capital since 1915, with a population estimated at about 3,000, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at about 1,500.

**Geographical Features**

The Bermudas consist of about 300 coralstone islands and islets, roughly in the form of a fishhook, along the southern rim of the oval plateau summit, about 22 miles from east to west and 14 miles from north to south, of a steep submarine volcanic mountain which is reputed to be between 14,000 and 15,000 feet in height. The ten principal islands are connected by bridges and form a chain about 22 miles long between its north-east and south-west extremities. These islands vary in width but the main island, which is about 14 miles long, has an average width of about 1 mile; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 259·4 feet above the sea. All the other islands and the areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,240 acres.

**Climate**

The climate is generally mild and humid with a mean annual temperature of 70° F. and average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 90° F. and 47° F., respectively. The coldest and hottest months are February and August with mean temperatures of 62° F. and 80° F., respectively. The average annual rainfall is 58·1 inches. The climate shows very little variation throughout the Colony.

**History**

According to a 17th century French cartographer the islands were probably discovered in 1503 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers' ship *The Sea Venture* was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was granted by King James I, in 1612 and the first emigrants went out in that year. Shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands", and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name. In 1684 the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled and government passed to the Crown.

**Constitution**

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620. Since 1684 the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature. Until 1888 this legislature consisted of the Governor and the House of Assembly and since then of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of three official and four unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of eleven members, three of whom are official and eight unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 5,076 electors, the elector's qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240.

With the enactment of the Women's Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

**Taxation**

There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 10s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property, plus 1s. 6d. on every £100 for those freeholders receiving sewerage service. The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1938 | 460,002    | 452,072        |

| 1956 | 3,107,618  | 3,029,124      |

In 1956 £1,972,435 of revenue was derived from Customs duties.

The main heads of expenditure were:

- Trade Development Board: £436,625
- Education: £417,633
- Public Works: £315,774
- Board of Trade: £201,225
- Agriculture: £180,013

**Currency**

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £1,123,896, were in circulation on 31st December, 1956.
Development

During 1956 a Parks Division of the Department of Agriculture was formed. The Colony was divided into three sections, each under a Superintendent who is responsible for the felling of dead trees, reafforestation and general maintenance in his section. This arrangement is proving very satisfactory. By the end of 1956 75% of the roadsides in the eastern, 50% in the central, and 25% in the western section had been cleared to a depth of 100 feet and more than 15,000 plants were used in various planting projects.

Citrus culture continued to make good progress and locally budded citrus trees were offered for sale by the Department of Agriculture for the first time. Almost all local trees, particularly grapefruit, produced such heavy crops of high quality fruit that from the middle of December, 1956, a ban was imposed on the import of oranges, lemons and grapefruit. It is hoped soon to improve the system of distribution of the fruit.

Despite the handicap of the destruction by fire at the end of 1955 of its records, including some 3,000 plans, all Survey Office drawings and some surveying equipment, the Department of Public Works accomplished a great deal of construction and maintenance of, and repairs to, the civil airport, bridges, hospitals, the public library, roads and schools.

Note.—The number of courses rather than the number of institutions is given, as one institution may provide more than one type of course.

During 1956 the enrolment at St. George's Secondary Modern School increased to 124 pupils and a secondary department with an enrolment of 73 pupils was added to another of the local schools.

The approximate number of Bermudian students attending schools, colleges and universities in the United Kingdom is 25 and in Canada and the United States, 191.

Government expenditure on education in 1956 was £495,844, compared with £28,057 in 1936 and £13,198 in 1926.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Bermuda Library, with adult, children's and music departments in Hamilton, is being greatly enlarged. It has a branch in St. George and a distribution service to the schools of the Colony.

The Bermuda Government Aquarium with adjoining live zoological collection, which has recently been considerably enlarged and much improved, has a museum of local natural history and other exhibits. The Bermuda Historical Society also has museums in Hamilton and St. George containing items of local historical interest.

Health

The level of health in the Colony is high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.

The King Edward VII Memorial Hospital is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1957 to £132,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. There is no public hospital or Government medical scheme.

During 1956 total government expenditure on Health Services was £300,239 compared with approximately £40,112 in 1936 and £28,669 in 1926.

Communications

The air terminal is at Kindley Field, St. George's Island.

Pan American Airways, Eastern Airlines and B.O.A.C maintain regular daily services between Bermuda and the United States of America. B.O.A.C. also operates weekly services in both directions between Bermuda and London thrice, Bahamas twice, Jamaica twice and Barbados and Trinidad thrice, two of which call at Puerto Rico. Trans-Canada Airlines operate two weekend return services between Montreal and/or Toronto and Bermuda; also in summer one, and in winter two, mid-week return services between Canada, Bermuda, Barbados and Trinidad. Iberia calls at Bermuda once a week between Madrid, Lisbon, the Azores and Havana and Mexico City, and once a week eastbound only between Caracas, Puerto Rico and the Azores and Madrid. Cubana calls at Bermuda once a week both ways between Havana, the Azores, Lisbon and Madrid. K.L.M. operates weekly services, twice between Bermuda and Europe, and once between Bermuda and Central and South America.

The Bermuda Government abandoned the railway in 1947.

The Colony has about 128·17 miles of mostly well-surfaced road, of which 8½ miles are in Hamilton and 4½ miles in St. George.

The Furness Bermuda Line's ship Q.T.E.V. Queen of Bermuda maintains a weekly service between Bermuda and the United States and their Ocean Monarch operates, mostly as a cruise ship, between Bermuda, the United States, Bahamas, Cuba and the Saguenay River in Canada.

The Pacific Steam Navigation Company's passenger liners Reina del Pacifico and Reina del Mar call at Bermuda every 5–6 weeks in both directions on their regular service between the United Kingdom, France, Spain and South America and in the autumn operate a single cruise from the United Kingdom to the West Indies calling at Bermuda in both directions. The same company's freighters with accommodation for twelve passengers call at Bermuda approximately every three weeks outboard from the United Kingdom to Bahamas and Cuba and inbound if inducement offers. The Royal Mail Line's Loch steamers call at Bermuda approximately once a month outboard to North American west coast ports and their "E" ships visit the Colony fortnightly outboard to Caribbean ports. They also call at Bermuda inbound to the United Kingdom if inducement offers. The Montreal, Australia and New Zealand Line's inbound steamers from Australia and New Zealand call at Bermuda about four times a year each to discharge refrigerated meat and dairy produce en route to Canadian and United Kingdom ports, respectively. Intermediate Cunard passenger liners call at Bermuda twice inward and once outward annually between United Kingdom and United States ports.
Cargo and passenger liners of Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships, Limited, visit Bermuda about thrice monthly southbound and once monthly northbound between Canadian, British West Indies and British Guiana ports. The Booth-Lampert and Holt Service operates an irregular three-weekly cargo and passenger service between United States, Caribbean and South American ports, calling at Bermuda outbound only.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The only marketing scheme in operation in Bermuda is the "Planned Production and Marketing Scheme" introduced in 1949 to assist the growers of vegetables to find a suitable outlet for their produce. The growers taking part in the scheme contract to grow a specified acreage of certain vegetable crops. The Department of Agriculture agrees to purchase any produce from the acreage specified at guaranteed minimum prices. In addition to the produce grown on contract the Government Wholesale Agricultural Marketing Centre buys other vegetables, citrus fruit and bananas. This scheme has undoubtedly assisted the farming community as more farmers are applying to join. During 1955 purchases of agricultural produce at the Wholesale Marketing Centre amounted to £62,548. Receipts from the resale of this produce exceeded £59,631.
