Geographical Features

The three main zones are:—

(a) the Kyrenia range, which rises to a height of over 3,000 feet, running along the northern coast and terminating in the Karpas peninsula;

(b) the massif in the south-west of the island, of which the highest point is Mount Olympus (6,406 feet); and

(c) the central plain, known as the "Mesaoria".

Climate

The mean temperature as recorded in Nicosia for the last 20 years is 66·6° F., mean maximum 78·4° F.; mean minimum 54·8° F.; highest shade temperature during that time, 112° F.; lowest, 22° F.; average rainfall for the last 20 years, 21·05 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole island. The climate is varied; hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the coast; on the hills inland it is bracing and healthy. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point on the plains and is mild on the coast, whilst the inland mountains are snow-covered for several weeks.

History

The history of Cyprus is long and eventful. In early historical times the island had been under the rule of Egypt, Persia, Rome and Byzantium. During the last named period its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. In 1191 Cyprus was conquered by Richard I of England following the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. From Richard the island passed to the Knights Templars, and later, when they found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, ex-King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, although the Genoese Republic held Famagusta from 1373 until 1464. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island and retained possession of it until its transfer to British administration.

On 4th June, 1878, a convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements" consented "to assign the island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England".

On 14th August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of 5th November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognized the annexation.

On 1st May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally made a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Constitution

Up to 12th November, 1931, the Government was regulated by Letters Patent of 10th March, 1925, providing for the administration of the Colony by a Governor aided by Executive and Legislative Councils. The Legislature consisted of the Governor, nine official members and 15 elected members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and 12 by the non-Mohammedan voters. After the disturbances which occurred in the autumn of 1931 in various parts of the island, those clauses of the Letters Patent which dealt with the constitution of the Legislative Council were revoked by Letters Patent dated 12th November, 1931, power to legislate being vested in the Governor. There is an Executive Council consisting, at present, of the Governor, the Deputy Governor, the Administrative Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

On the 26th November, 1955, a state of emergency was declared in Cyprus. Under the Emergency Regulations the Governor has special powers for the maintenance of law and order in face of the campaign of armed attacks on security personnel and civilians and on public buildings which began in April, 1955. The Governor had previously assumed direct control of all internal security operations in the island, which he exercises through a Director of Operations. Since December, 1956, the Governor has progressively relaxed the Emergency Regulations whenever he considered that the situation in the island permitted.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized and non-natives may acquire land. Except with the consent of the Governor, no alien may acquire, otherwise than by inheritance, ownership of any immovable property in the Colony. Compulsory acquisition of land may be made for purposes of public utility, with the consent of the Governor.

Taxation

Incomes which do not exceed £300 are exempted from income tax; and the tax ranges from 50 mils for every £ in excess of £300 to 750 mils for every £ in excess of £6,000. Relief is given at the rate of £50 for each unmarried child under the age of 16 or (if over 16) receiving full-time instruction at an educational establishment. Where any child between the ages of 11 and 25 is receiving full-time instruction outside the Colony, this allowance is increased to an amount not exceeding £250 in respect of expenditure incurred on the child's maintenance and education. Relief is also given
in respect of the wife's earned income up to a maximum of £50, and in respect of life insurance premiums and pension and provident fund contributions. In the case of bachelors and spinsters the tax payable is increased by 33½%, rising to 50% where the tax payable exceeds £90, up to a maximum of £500. The tax on salaries, wages and pensions is collected under the system of Pay As You Earn. Companies and similar bodies pay a flat rate of 425 mills in the £ and deduct this tax from any dividends declared; credit is given to the shareholder for the tax thus deducted in calculating his personal tax liability. Arrangements for relief from double taxation exist with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, and relief is also given if tax is payable on the same income in any of Her Majesty's possessions where reciprocal relief is given. By an exchange of notes between the United Kingdom and the Greek Government there is reciprocal exemption of air transport profits between Cyprus and Greece.

Estate duty is levied on the estate of any deceased person which exceeds £2,000 in value. The rates of estate duty are not fixed on a percentage basis in the case of estates of £15,000 in value and under. Such estates are divided into categories and the rates are specific amounts chargeable on each category. The specific amounts so chargeable range from £40 on estates between £2,000 and £2,500 in value to £1,615 on estates between £14,000 and £15,000 in value. In the case of estates in excess of £15,000 in value a percentage is imposed. This percentage is levied by "layers" and ranges between 21% and 30% on that part of the estate which exceeds £15,000 in value. Relief is given in respect of quick succession where the estate consists of immovable property or a business, and for estate duty paid in respect of the same estate in any country of the British Commonwealth.

The ordinary revenue includes £750,000 grant-in-aid from the United Kingdom Government for Emergency and Ordinary Expenditure includes £3,625,025 spent on the Emergency.

The expenditure on Development does not include expenditure met from the proceeds of Loans. The figure for Development Revenue does not include appropriation from Ordinary Budget amounting to £800,000 and appropriation from General Revenue amounting to £5,000,000 at the end of 1956.

The main sources of ordinary revenue in 1956 were (to nearest £1,000) Customs Duties £5,136,000; Excise Duties £1,599,000; Income Tax £4,468,000; Licences, Other Taxes and Duties £478,000; Fees and Services £730,000; Forests £134,000; Post Office £233,000; Rents and Royalties £78,000; Interest on Government Moneys £1,332,000 and Miscellaneous Receipts £144,000.

The general revenue balance on the 31st December, 1956, was £554,064.

The Public Debt at 31st December, 1956, amounted to £9,734,959 with accumulated sinking funds for the funded debt amounting to £1,658,295. The outstanding amount of loans made by the Colony on the same date was £14,354,309 of which £500,000 was for loan made to Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, £5,483,926 to the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, £1,500,000 to the Grain Commission, £1,499,915 to the Cyprus Inland Telecommunications Authority, and £5,370,478 for loans to local authorities, etc., in Cyprus.

### Currency

Notes of the following denominations are in circulation:—£5, £1, 500 mils and 250 mils (£ = 1,000 mils).

Coins in circulation:—

- Cupro-nickel, 100 mils, 50 mils and 25 mils.
- Bronze, 5 mils and 3 mils.

### Development Plans

Development in Cyprus is financed from three sources: (1) the Development Fund, in accordance with a six-year Development Programme ending on the 31st December, 1961; (2) loans from the Public Loans Fund to public bodies for all kinds of works, the capital of the Fund being almost entirely obtained from annual appropriations from Revenue; (3) loans on the London market, or raised locally, which have hitherto only been raised for the central electrification and internal telecommunication schemes.

The balance of the new fund as at the 31st December, 1956, was approximately £6,375,000, and expenditure during 1956, the first year of the new programme, amounted to £2,784,000. The main items were:

- Agriculture: £178,000
- Education: £265,000
- Forests: £57,000
- Harbours: £172,000
- Medical: £136,000
- Road: £367,000
- Rural Development: £430,000
- Water Development: £700,000
- Civil Aviation: £51,000

No internal or external development loans were raised in 1956 and the Electricity and Telecommunications Authorities had to rely on temporary finance in the form of advances from Government until further loans can be raised.
In 1956 the Public Loans Fund issued 135 loans amounting to £650,000 to various public bodies for development works of all kinds.

Other Development

During 1956 the Electricity Authority of Cyprus extended its central steam electric generating station at Dhekelia and also built new 66,000 volt transmission lines to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity. New 11,000 volt transmission lines were constructed, and existing 11,000 volt lines were extended, to serve villages, irrigation, and industrial consumers.

The capacity of the generating plant installed at Dhekelia Generating Station was increased from 28,750 kWs to 42,750 kWs and the output for 1956 was 103,919,400 units compared with 72,666,700 units in 1955.

Education

Two teachers' training colleges, one accommodating 239 men students at Morphou and another for 95 women students at Nicosia, provide the only form of higher education at present available in Cyprus; a new and larger mixed training college is nearing completion and is expected to open at the beginning of 1958. Secondary Schools number 55, with a total enrolment of 17,667; the reduction in schools and in number of pupils has been a result of the Emergency. There are 729 Government Elementary Schools with an enrolment of 77,575 and 19 non-Government Elementary Schools with an enrolment of 1,817. There are usually separate schools for Greeks, Turks and Armenians, but most schools are co-educational; a small number of elementary and secondary schools cater for all communities.

A plan for the development of technical education in the Island was drawn up in 1955. There are now a preparatory technical school for 240 boys in Nicosia, a secondary technical school for 900 boys at Limassol, and a technical school (craft training) at Lefka. The Technical Institute, which, in its final form will provide post-secondary education, opened in September, 1956. Two post-elementary rural central schools provide education with a practical agricultural bias for the sons of the farming community. Evening Institutes (53) in various towns and villages cater for ex-elementary school pupils in the 14 to 17 age group who have not attended secondary schools.

Government expenditure on educational services in 1956-57 amounted to £1,817,800 compared with £1,292,000 in 1955-56 and £121,986 in 1935.

Libraries and Museums

There are public libraries in Nicosia, Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia, which are controlled by the Municipalities. Small lending libraries have been opened by enterprising booksellers in Limassol and Nicosia. The Antiquities Department maintains museums in Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos.

Health

The Government hospitals (including two sanatoria, a mental hospital and a home for disabled) provided 1,369 beds in 1956. In addition there were 780 beds in 53 private hospitals, 123 beds in 13 rural hospitals and 102 beds in two mines hospitals. Out-patients (first-attendances) at the six District Hospitals numbered 132,275; rural dispensaries dealt with 43,397 cases.

Expenditure by Government on medical and allied services was £738,997 in 1956 compared with £52,436 in 1935.

Communications

Cyprus Airways Limited provide regular scheduled air services to Greece, Turkey, Beirut, Tel Aviv (Lod), and in conjunction with B.E.A. to Rome, Milan, Munich and London. Other airlines serving the Colony are Olympic Airways, El Al, Middle East Airlines, Air Liban, Turkish State Airlines and Skyways Limited (Colonial coach class service). The only international airport is at Nicosia. There are no internal services.

The following table shows the roads, excluding Forest Department roads, which exist in the Colony:

| Roads                        | Miles |
|------------------------------|-------|
| Commissioners' roads (mostly gravel) | 1,780 |
| P.W.D. roads (gravel)        | 170   |
| P.W.D. roads (asphalt)       | 797   |
| **Total**                    | **2,747** |

The main ports in the Island are Famagusta, Larnaca and Limassol. Famagusta has a harbour where vessels of an overall length of 425 feet and a maximum draught of 22½ feet can easily be berthed alongside the quay. Vessels at Larnaca and Limassol anchor in the open roadstead about 4–5 cables off the main jetty, and goods are transported to and from the shore by means of lighters.

Regular passenger services are run between Cyprus and other parts of the Mediterranean. Cargo ships of many nationalities—the most regular being vessels of the British Conference Lines (Mediterranean Section), some of which accept passengers—call at Cyprus ports, on voyages between British, Continental and Mediterranean ports, Mediterranean and Red Sea ports and U.S.A., Mediterranean and Black Sea ports.

There is no railway or inland waterway.

Sound and Television Broadcasting

The Cyprus Broadcasting Service, a Government Department, has been operating since October, 1953. There are two networks, Greek and Turkish, and medium wave transmitters are used to give island-wide coverage. The two main transmitters are situated at Athalassa, a few miles south of Nicosia, and have a power of 20 kW each. A transmitter (2 kW) relaying the Greek programmes is situated near Ktima, Paphos district, and a transmitter (250 W) relaying the Turkish programmes, is situated in Limassol. At certain times of the day a common programme in English is relayed by both networks. There are approximately 80,000 licence holders and the licence fee is £1 per annum.

A pilot television service for the Nicosia area commenced operating in October, 1957. International Radio Consultative Committee (C.C.I.R.) standards are employed and the effective radiated power is 1·5 kW. This television service is a section of the Cyprus Broadcasting Service.

Principal Occupations

The principal occupation is agriculture in which some 136,000 persons are employed. Approximate numbers in other occupations are:

- Building and Construction: 21,000
- Other manufacturing industries: 36,200
- Commerce, Public Administration, Transport and other Services: 61,600
- Mining: 6,800
At the end of 1956 there were three Employers' Associations with 101 members, and 161 Women's Unions with a membership of 38,993. In addition there were four registered (and one unregistered) Federations co-ordinating the activities of Workmen's Unions, with a membership of 37,196 and six Unions of Civil Servants, with a membership of 3,935.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products are wheat, barley, potatoes (two crops a year), onions, vegetables, legumes, linseed, hemp fibre, sesame, cumin, aniseed, tobacco, carobs (locust beans), almonds, olives, figs, citrus, deciduous fruits, pomegranates, vine products, cheese, wool, hides and skins.

The livestock population in 1956 was:

Camels . . . 143
Horses, mules and donkeys 51,735
Cattle . . . 28,406
Sheep . . . 385,214
Goats . . . 157,863
Pigs . . . 32,583
Poultry . . . 1,500,000 (Estimated)
Rabbits . . . 100,000 (Estimated)

Timber production in 1956 was 861,000 cubic feet R.U.B., including 780,000 cubic feet of softwood (pine) and 81,000 cubic feet of hardwood timber. Firewood and charcoal production amounted to 518,000 and 10,000 cubic feet respectively. All these products were consumed in Cyprus.

Cyprus fisheries are not rich owing to the lack of nutrient salts, and the supply of fish is not equal to the demand. All the catch (436,210 okes* in 1956) is sold locally and consumed fresh. There are no inshore fisheries.

The principal minerals are cupreous and iron pyrites and asbestos. Chromite, gypsum and terra umbra are also produced and exported.

Apart from the major industries of agriculture and mining and the newly erected cement plant, there is a considerable variety of light factory industries in Cyprus. These may be classified as follows:

Food Products.—Flour milling, bakery products, macaroni, canned fruit and vegetables, jams and marmalades, confectionery (including Turkish delight and sugared almonds), ice cream, animal fodder compounds, olive oil, edible seed oils.

Beverages and Tobacco.—Wines, spirits, grape must, soft drinks and cordials, cigarettes, ice.

Textiles and Clothing.—Cotton yarn and cloth, hosiery, shirts, underwear, footwear, quilts, lace and embroidery.

Building Materials, etc.—Bricks, tiles, pottery, plaster and plasterboard, asbestos sheets, nails.

Miscellaneous.—Locust bean gum, olive kernel oil, perfumery, essential oils, soap, detergents (new industry), crown corks, metal containers, motor bodies and carts, threshing machines, furniture, travel goods, baskets, brooms, buttons, artificial teeth, tyre retreading.

Some of these are scarcely more than minor cottage industries but most of them operate in factory conditions. Poultry breeding continued to develop during the year. There was very intense building activity during 1956 and the first half of 1957, both private and for the Armed Services, and a great expansion of some of the plants supplying the building industry. The new industrial plants erected during the period include a bulk station for producer gas.

In 1938 32·9% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 16% from other Commonwealth countries and 51·1% from foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1956 were: 45·4%, 8·4% and 46·2%.

In 1938 24·6% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 4·6% to other Commonwealth countries and 70·8% to foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1956 were: 24·9%, 2·1% and 73·0%.

Principal Exports by Volume and Value

| Item          | 1938 | 1955 | 1956 |

The chief imports are wheat, timber, mineral fuels and lubricants, manufactured fertilizers, cotton, silk and woollen manufactures, cement, iron and steel manufactures and machinery and transport equipment.

Tourist Traffic

One of the results of terrorism was the enormous drop in the number of visitors to the Island. During 1956 only 11,154 persons visited the Island compared with 27,233 in 1955. Transit passengers fell to 1,850 compared with 4,921 in 1955.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are at present no Marketing Boards in Cyprus, but the Government, acting through an appointed Board set up under special legislation as the Grain Commission, is the sole purchaser of wheat and barley using as its agents the co-operative societies in the villages.

* 5 okes = 1 stone.
Under other legislation a Vine Products Scheme has been established with the Commissioner for Co-operative Development as Controller. This Scheme purchases all grape alcohol (zivania) from the producers and resells to manufacturers of wines and spirits at a price which is fixed from time to time. The Controller is advised by a Committee on which producers and manufacturers are represented. The same Scheme also purchases raisins from producers at a safety price fixed by Government and then resells.

The other form of organized marketing societies is that of the various co-operative marketing societies and unions which deal with substantial quantities of carobs, wines and spirits, fresh and dried fruits and potatoes. There are at present 824 co-operatives of which 487 are thrift and credit, 266 retail stores, 39 marketing and processing, 13 olive pressing, 4 transport, 7 farming, 1 machinery, 3 wholesale supply unions, 2 irrigation, 1 housing, and 1 Central Bank. Membership exceeds 147,000 and approximately 70% of the funds used by the movement comprise £1,047,000 of reserves and about £4,301,000 of deposits.
