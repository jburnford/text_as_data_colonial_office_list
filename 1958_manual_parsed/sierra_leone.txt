SIERRA LEONE

Area

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925 South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

Population

The latest estimate of population was 2,260,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 2,130,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these, and about 2,000 Europeans and Asiatics, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

Principal Towns

| Estimated Population |
|----------------------|
| Freetown, capital    | 70,000 |
| Bo, S.W. Province    | 15,610 |
| Kenema, S.E. Province| 6,300  |
| Makieni, N. Province | 7,500  |

Geographical Features

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

Climate

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground. Most of the rain falls in the three months July-September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10° inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.
ment of the old 32 member Legislative Council with a larger House of Representatives consisting of a Speaker, four *ex officio* Members, 51 elected members and two nominated members, the last to have no voting powers. Of the 51 elected members, 14 represent Freetown and the Colony area, 25 represent Electoral Districts in the Protectorate, and the remaining 12 are Paramount Chiefs elected by the 12 District Councils in the Protectorate. Elections to the new House on a franchise extended to include virtually all adult males and all adult female taxpayers or property owners, were held in May 1957 and the House met for the first time in July, 1957.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

**Land Policy**

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding 50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

**Taxation**

There are three forms of direct taxation in force: income tax, poll tax, and local tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief; there are allowances for children (up to four) up to the age of 16 years or so long as they are receiving whole-time education; and for life assurance premiums up to certain limits. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. A double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government. Poll tax is payable by non-natives at the rate of £4 a year and is offset against individual liability for income tax. A Local Tax Ordinance introduced in 1954 replaces the House Tax, formerly paid by all adult native males, by a Local Tax. This is subject to a maximum of 25s. per head, and within chiefdoms is paid at a fixed rate. In general terms payment applies to all adult male persons residing in each chiefdom and in certain cases to adult females also. Revenue from this tax is divided between District Councils and Native Administrations.

The main form of indirect taxation is the Customs tariff.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | 886,149 | 910,077     |
| 1952 | 5,213,775 | 5,401,539   |
| 1953 | 5,418,153 | 5,269,095   |
| 1954 | 7,621,299 | 6,863,115   |
| 1955 | 7,545,788 | 7,397,335   |
| 1956 | 9,585,738 | 9,846,278   |

In 1956, £5,356,772 of total revenue was derived from Customs and £2,441,285 from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

- Development Schemes (excluding transfers of £812,000 to the Development and Education Funds from revenue) £1,191,274,
- Medical and Education Services £1,569,928,
- Public Works and Electricity recurrent £982,630,
- non-recurrent Public Works £460,156,
- Law and Order £623,139,
- Provincial Administration and the Secretariat £183,986.

The Public Debt at the end of December 1956 amounted to £4,410,582 (approximately £2 4s. 1d. per head of population) and comprised:

- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1958–63 £570,000
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968 £81,425
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968 £49,157
- Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968–70 £2,030,000
- 2nd Installment Sierra Leone Government 3½% inscribed Stock 1968–70 £1,680,000

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100 Sh., 20 Sh. and 10 Sh.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2 Sh., 1 Sh., and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development Plans**

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946 (and reviewed in 1949 when "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was published). The Plans provided for the development of Communications, Natural Resources and Social and Basic Services at a total cost of £5,000,000 in the ten-year period.

As a contribution towards this expenditure, an allocation of £2,600,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 was made.

The amount which it is expected to spend on development (largely on works construction) in the period 1st January 1957 to 31st December 1959 is £9,985,502 made up as follows:

- Lungi Airport £40,000
- Inland Waterways £13,500
- Freetown Electricity Supplies £401,718
- Provincial Electricity Supplies £103,204
- Provincial Water Supplies £174,558
- Roads and Bridges £1,634,214
- Railway and Port Development £1,464,457
- Guma Valley Hydro-electric Scheme £2,683,411
- Agriculture £778,509
- Schools and Colleges £1,282,281
- Hospitals and Clinics £220,191
- Public Buildings and Housing Schemes £1,171,000
- Fisheries Research £18,459

£9,985,502

It is hoped to finance this programme from loan funds, the Development and Education Funds, and from the territory's allocations under the 1945 and 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts. The allocation under the 1955 Act is £1,200,000.
Education

University courses in Divinity, Arts, Science, Commerce and Education are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown. At the beginning of the 1956–57 session, 253 students were in attendance at these courses and, apart from scholarships for secondary education and teacher training, 171 scholarships were awarded, 93 for higher education, including study overseas. About 26 students were known to be studying in the U.S.A.

There are five Teacher Training Colleges and one Teacher Training Department in the territory; 570 students, including 41 agricultural instructors, were in training in 1956.

There are two Government Secondary Grammar Schools, four Government Junior Secondary Schools and 15 assisted Secondary Schools and post-primary schools; 5,776 pupils were enrolled in 1956. There is also an unassisted Secondary School, which has 200 pupils. Five Government, 432 assisted and 23 unassisted Primary Schools had an enrolment of 56,020 pupils.

The Technical Institute, Freetown, which opened in 1953, and the Technical Institute, Kenema, which opened in 1956, had 1,530 students by the end of 1956, enrolled in engineering, carpentry, commercial and other technical and vocational courses.

Literacy campaigns were conducted in 1954 by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in 36 chiefdoms, and 1,463 reading certificates were issued. The Bureau reported that in ten years 34,000 people were estimated to have attained literacy in one vernacular, while 301,000 books in five vernaculars (Mende, Temne, Limba, Kono, and Koranko) had been sold, 167,000 of them within the last five years of the period.

The Extramural Department of Fourah Bay College, the British Council and the Social Welfare Department organized adult education courses in various subjects.

Expenditure on education, other than under the Development Plan, was £833,139 in 1956. In 1935 total expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Libraries

Fourah Bay College has a library of some 12,000 volumes. The British Council maintains a subscription library of over 22,000 books and makes regular bulk loans of books and periodicals to the Protectorate. In Freetown there are also two small public libraries.

Health

Diseases contended with in Sierra Leone, in addition to such infections as typhoid and dysentery, which are common, include malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy, tuberculosis, goitre, rabies, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, smallpox, cerebro-spinal fever and yaws. The incidence of the last five is comparatively low. The Health Service includes an Endemic Diseases Control Unit, an Entomological Laboratory and the former Malaria Control Unit.

At the beginning of 1957 beds available in hospitals (including two Infirmarys and a maternity hospital) totalled 1,293 (Government 936, Missions 271, Mining 86). The latest treatment figures are for 1955, when in-patients at Government Hospitals numbered 12,188 and out-patients 177,131. At the 32 Government dispensaries (excluding 25 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) 116,179 new cases were treated.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1956 was £736,789. By comparison actual expenditure in 1935 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the only international airport in the territory and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Air Services are operated through Freetown Airport by Air France, Hunting-Clan/Airwork Services and West African Airways Corporation. They connect Sierra Leone to other parts of West Africa and provide six services a week to and from the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.

Air and marine navigational aids, and aeradio and meteorological radio services, are also provided.

The railway carried 1,502,673 passengers and 117,511 tons of freight in 1956. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 339. This mileage included a branch line covering a distance of 83¼ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 2,963 miles of road, 1,574 miles of trunk roads motorable throughout the year, and 1,389 miles of feeder roads.

Freetown, a port of British Shipping Registry, has anchorage room for 240 ships of unrestricted draught and berths for three ships alongside the new Queen Elizabeth II Quay, which is 1,250 feet long with a depth of 32 feet of water at Mean Low Water Ordinary Springs. Oil bunkers can now be obtained by ships alongside the Quay, and ships also berth alongside the nearby Kissy Oil Jetty for oil bunkers, or to discharge various types of fuel into the Oil Storage Company's tanks. Smaller ports are at Pepel, Bonthe and Sulima. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines; Bonthe and Sulima are loading ports for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and Palm Line, Limited, and to the Continent by Holland West Africa Line. A limited cargo service to the east coast ports of America is provided by Elder Dempster Lines, Limited, and the Barber Steamship Lines, and to South Africa by J. P. Holmen, Limited, and Elder Dempster Lines, Limited.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

Broadcasting

The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service, transmitting from Freetown, was inaugurated on the 19th October, 1955 and at present operates from 6·45 to 8·00 a.m. and 4·45 to 10·00 p.m. on a frequency of 3,316 kilocycles in the 90 metre band with a power of 5 kilowatts. The Service consists of approximately two hours' local programme and the remainder re-radiated B.B.C. Overseas Service.
It is planned to extend the hours of direct broadcasting early in 1958, when a separate Department of Broadcasting will be formed. On the 1st October, 1957, the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 2,240.

Government also operates a wired system in Freetown which broadcasts local programmes and the B.B.C. Overseas Service. On the 1st October, 1957, the number of subscribers was 4,072.

The operation and maintenance of both systems are at present in charge of the Posts and Telegraphs Department, whilst programmes are arranged by the Public Relations Department. These functions will of course be taken over by the new Department of Broadcasting when it comes into being early in 1958.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population is engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups at the end of 1956 to be as follows:

- Building and Construction: 8,157
- Mining: 5,897
- Transport (road, rail and air): 5,808
- Maritime and Waterfront: 3,017
- Commerce: 5,569
- Other principal industries and services (including public administration, health and agriculture): 16,401

These workers served the following employers:

- Government: 16,598
- Native administrations: 2,613
- Service Departments (civilian employees of War Department and Admiralty): 1,709
- Major private and commercial undertakings: 23,789

In addition an estimated 32,500 workers were employed by smaller employers i.e. of less than six persons. During 1956 the average monthly figure of all workers in wage-earning employment was approximately 77,331.

There were, at the end of 1956, 11 registered trade unions with a total membership of 26,085, including one employers' union with 22 members.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, benniseed, kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is:

- Cattle: 150,000
- Goats: 21,500
- Sheep: 10,000
- Pigs: 5,000

The main timber products are sawn timber, shingles, roundwood, firewood, charcoal and gum copal. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. Two Italian trawlers have recently begun operations from Freetown.

The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite and molybdenite.

Nine pioneer oil mills for the expressing of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut oil and palm kernel oil is being operated by Government. Government also operates two small and two large rice mills and there are a number of privately-owned mills. Connected with the Government rice mills is the complementary enterprise of pig and poultry feed production.

Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise.

Village industries include fishing, fish curing and smoking, weaving, and hand methods of expressing palm oil and cracking palm kernels.

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it.

On 30th April, 1957, there were 283 co-operative societies with 15,500 members, and with their capital and savings amounting to over £29,000. Their surplus and reserves were over £26,000.
Their turnover during the year ending on that date was £273,000. In addition, they purchased equipment for cultivation and transport to a value of over £24,000.

The most important items were cocoa and coffee marketing which amounted to over £144,000. Rice marketing developed considerably to a value of over £55,000. An important new work was the undertaking of mechanical rice cultivation by means of equipment co-operatively owned. Twenty-two tractors with ancillary equipment cultivated successfully over 3,500 acres.

Societies issued short-term loans to their members to the extent of some £40,000. They also distributed a new type of long-term loan for the extension of cocoa farms to the amount of some £2,000. Societies received short-term loan from the Registrar some £35,500, and medium-term loans for the purchase of equipment to the extent of £23,000.
