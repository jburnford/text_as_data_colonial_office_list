NORTH BORNEO

Area
North Borneo, which includes the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo, is 29,388 square miles in area or roughly the size of Ireland. It is divided into four Residencies: Sandakan, 9,534 square miles; Tawau, 7,011 square miles; Interior, 7,613 square miles and West Coast, 5,195 square miles. Since October, 1955, Labuan Island, 35 square miles, has been administered by a District Officer who is responsible directly to the Chief Secretary, Jesselton.

Population
The 1956 (end-year) estimate was 389,122:
Indigenous ........................................... 262,600
Chinese .................................................. 92,856
European (including Eurasian) ...................... 1,794
Others .................................................... 31,872

Principal Towns
All are situated on the coast, and have good harbours:

| Population at 1951 Census |
|---------------------------|
| Jesselton (capital) ........ 11,704 |
| Sandakan ..................... 14,499 |
| Tawau .......................... 4,282 |
| Victoria, Labuan ............. 2,526 |
| Kudat ........................... 1,895 |

Geographical Features
Central mountain ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in height, rise somewhat sharply from low hills nearer the coast and culminate in Mount Kinabalu (13,455 feet) the highest mountain in the East Indies. The coastline is formed mainly of alluvial flats, with many creeks and swamps. Hills and valleys in most cases are covered with dense forest and there are many rivers. The most extensive plain is that on the east coast, irrigated by the river Kinabatangan and its tributaries, and believed to contain some 4,000 square miles of rich and fertile soil. In the interior are found the Keningau and Tambunan plains which are traversed by the Pegalan River. The Keningau plain consists of wide stretches of grassland, while Tambunan maintains a large padi-planting population.

Labuan, 35 square miles in area, is an island lying six miles off the mainland. It has an excellent, well-sheltered harbour, and during 1956 regained its pre-war status as a free port.

Climate
This is relatively cool for a place situated so near the equator.

| Mean Maximum Temperatures (°C) | Mean Minimum Temperatures (°C) | Mean Rainfall (inches) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| Jesselton ...................... | 86·5 73·1° 129·30               |
| Sandakan ....................... | 87·7 73·0° 149·38               |

Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively dry belts. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and lasts until March or April; the south-west monsoon prevails from the beginning of May until August. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt.
History

Early in the sixteenth century the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the bulk of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued, and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. The Sultan of Brunei offered the island of Labuan to the British Government in 1844 and in accordance with that offer the island was annexed in 1846, the cession being formally agreed to in a treaty with the Sultan in 1847. In 1878, after protracted negotiations, a large area on the mainland was ceded by the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory, and was made in perpetuity. In November 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Limited, which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882. This Company governed British North Borneo until January 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September 1945, and was under military administration until 15th July, 1946, when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new Colony of North Borneo on the same date under the Labuan Order in Council.

Constitution

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent under which a governor and commander-in-chief of the Colony is appointed. Under this instrument full sovereign rights are assumed over British North Borneo, following the North Borneo Cession Order in Council. The three instruments bear the date 10th July, 1946.

Authority was given under Letters Patent of 1950, for the establishment of a Legislative Council and Executive Council in and for the Colony, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto, and an Order in Council brought into force on the 17th October, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council. It is presided over by the Governor and consists of three *ex officio* members, nine official members and ten nominated members. The Executive Council consists of three *ex officio* members, two official members and four nominated members.

Land Policy

Government's policy is to protect the interests of natives, who are given grants in perpetuity instead of leases for limited periods up to 99 years. There are two forms of land tenure: leases available to all, and Native Titles available to natives (who include all indigenous inhabitants). No new lease for town or country land (not being a Native Title) may be for more than 99 years. The area opened up by natives (excluding village reserves) is approximately 144,347 acres, almost all on individual title. All unalienated land is the property of the Crown.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The rate applicable to Companies, incorporated or registered in the Colony or elsewhere, is 40%. The rates applicable to individuals are from 3½% on the first $12,000 of chargeable income to 20% on chargeable income in excess of $52,200. Arrangements have been concluded with the United Kingdom, Danish, and Swedish Governments for the avoidance of double taxation.

The other main source of taxation is Customs import and export duties. The highest general rate on imports is 30% *ad valorem* on motor vehicles, the preferential rate being 10%. Manufactured goods are usually charged 10% and textiles and clothing 15%, with a preferential rate of 7½%. The free list includes essential food-stuffs, building materials, and passengers' personal and household effects. Essential machinery and plant of British manufacture is also free of duty. The majority of goods exported are dutiable; 10% of the f.o.b. value is an average charge, but certain items are given special attention, e.g., rubber is charged 5½% *ad valorem* when the fixed price does not exceed 60 cents per pound, and on an increasing scale as the fixed price rises, e.g., with fixed price at $1·50 per pound the duty is 17 cents. In fixing the price an allowance of 5 cents per pound against the average Singapore buying price is made. In addition, cesses are levied on all rubber exported; ½ cent per pound for the development of the rubber industry, and 2 cents per pound to finance replanting and new planting by estates and smallholders. Most of the timber exported is charged a royalty, but other timber is charged export duty in accordance with the Timber Roll.

Public Finance

From the re-establishment of civil government, following the liberation from Japanese occupation in July 1946, to the end of 1956 local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure. Grants-in-aid totalling $20,842,862, of which $2,700,000 have since been repaid, and loans-in-aid amounting to $2,057,142 were provided by Her Majesty's Government for purposes of reconstruction. In addition, grants-in-aid totalling $4,700,000 have been made for *ex gratia* war damage compensation.

The principal items of revenue in the Ordinary Budget in 1956 were Customs $18,522,315, licences and internal revenue $4,233,167, forests $2,194,754. In the same year the main heads of expenditure in the Ordinary Budget were:

| Head of Expenditure          | Amount     |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Medical                      | $2,740,731 |
| Police                       | $2,496,802 |
| Public Works Recurrent       | $3,192,718 |
| District Administration      | $1,862,691 |
| Posts and Telegraphs         | $1,402,950 |
| Education                    | $1,419,127 |

The main items of revenue and expenditure in 1956 in the Development Account were:

**Revenue:**

- Contribution from Foreign Operations Administration towards cost of reconstruction of wharves: $801,282
- Colonial Development and Welfare grants: $2,805,007
- Contributions from the proceeds of the realization of the former Japanese assets: $2,636,620
- Appropriation from the Ordinary Budget: $6,500,000
- Miscellaneous: $1,933,251

**Expenditure:**

- Harbours: $1,049,988
- Public Works non-recurrent: $4,824,652
- Colonial Development Welfare schemes: $4,609,944
- Schemes financed from the proceeds of the realization of the former Japanese assets: $2,636,620

During the year 1956 an inter-colonial loan of $2,191,097 was floated. The total of the Public Debt at 31st December, 1956 was $8,723,640.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation consists mainly of Malayan currency, which was introduced by the British Military Administration immediately after the liberation of the territory, with a small quantity of British North Borneo Chartered Company notes and coin issued before the Japanese occupation. Chartered Company currency ceased to be legal tender on 31st August, 1953, but when handed into offices of the Treasury it remains redeemable at its face value for Malayan currency. The buying and selling rates of the Malayan dollar fluctuate slightly in accordance with the Singapore market. For the purpose of conversion to sterling, the value of a dollar is taken at 2s. 4d.

**Development Plans**

A Development Plan was prepared in 1955 for the period ending 1960, which envisaged the expenditure of approximately $47,000,000. Early in 1956 it was apparent, however, that the development plan would need considerable amendment, partly as a result of fiscal measures consequent upon release from United Kingdom Treasury control, and partly as a result of a revision of priorities arising from new needs. This revision has been accomplished and a modified scheme prepared for the expenditure of approximately $28,280,000 during the period 1957 to April 1960.

The projected sources of finance are:

- Colonial Development and Welfare Grants: $3,700,000
- Land Fund: $10,060,000
- Colony Fund: $14,520,000

to be directed towards the following broad heads of expenditure:

| Head of Expenditure          | Amount     |
|------------------------------|------------|
| Education                    | $2,460,000 |
| Health                       | $810,000   |
| Transport and Communications | $9,240,000 |
| Agriculture                  | $1,000,000 |
| Municipal Services           | $5,340,000 |
| Miscellaneous                | $9,430,000 |

**Education**

Primary education is provided in Malay, Chinese and English and to a small extent Dusun, the dialect of the largest indigenous community. Secondary education is in English and Chinese. There are 75 Government Primary Schools, one Government Secondary class and two Post-Primary Government Schools. In addition there are nine schools distributed between two Local Authorities which contributed in 1956 $44,902 towards the cost of education from funds raised locally. There are 111 Primary Schools in receipt of aid and secondary education is available in 16 other Government-aided establishments. There are 87 unaided Primary Schools and three secondary classes. The two Government Post-Primary Schools are the Trade School in Jesselton with 29 pupils and the Teachers' Training College (Kent College) at Tuaran with 135 students.

Of the 282 schools in the Colony 81 are Chinese. The total enrolment of pupils is 32,144 of whom 10,352 are girls. This compares with only 2,150 pupils in 1934. Of the present enrolment, 2,013 pupils are receiving secondary and 29,967 primary education.

No secondary technical and no post-secondary education is provided, but some 36 students are taking higher education courses overseas (mainly in Australia), 32 of them with scholarships or fellowships under the Colombo Plan.

In 1956 expenditure on education from Colony funds amounted to $1,340,941.

**Libraries**

There is a reference library in the Secretariat and reference and lending libraries are maintained at the headquarters of the Education Department and at the Information Office, Jesselton. The Information Office has organized branch libraries in Sandakan and four other smaller towns.

**Health**

The principal diseases are malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute respiratory disease, bowel infections and skin complaints. There are two general hospitals (320 beds); five cottage hospitals (301 beds); and 12 dispensaries (177 beds). There are also 18 dispensaries situated in outlying districts staffed by Senior Dressers under the supervision of District Medical Officers. In 1956 out-patients numbered 342,134 (308,332 in 1955) and in-patients 14,452.

There is a mental hospital at Sandakan with 100 beds and a leprosy settlement on Berhala Island near Sandakan, which accommodates 60 patients. There are at present 45 in the settlement.
There is a Health Centre in Sandakan and in Jesselton, each under the direct supervision of a Health Visitor. At these centres, maternity and child welfare clinics are held. Subsidiary rural health clinics in the Jesselton and Sandakan districts are regularly visited by the Health Centre staff and serve the up-country villages. Native midwives are being trained at each of the main hospitals and at each Cottage Hospital.

Expenditure on medical services from Colony funds in 1956 amounted to $2,822,689.

Communications

There are three civil airports, situated at Jesselton, Sandakan and Labuan, that at Labuan being of international standard. External services are provided by Malayan Airways from Singapore, Cathay Pacific Airways from Manila and Hong Kong, Qantas Empire Airways from Australia, and Garuda Indonesian Airways from Djakarta and Manila. In 1956 there were 14,000 movements of aircraft. An internal feeder service linking Labuan, Keningau, Ranau, Jesselton, Sandakan, Tawau, Lahad Datu and Kudat, is operated by Malayan Airways under a special arrangement with the Government.

In 1956, 593,593 passengers were carried on the railways and the weight of freight hauled was 44,976 tons. The total length of the railway, which is of metre gauge and serves the West Coast from Jesselton southwards and part of the interior, is 116 miles.

There are 225 miles of metalled roads with bitumen-sealed surface; 118 miles of other metalled roads; 359 miles of earth roads, and 593 miles of bridle paths.

The chief ports are Labuan, Sandakan, Jesselton, Kudat, Tawau and Lahad Datu. Seventeen shipping lines run services to and from the Colony as well as numerous other miscellaneous chartered vessels loading timber at Labuan and east coast ports. A regular feeder service to all ports in the Colony, Brunei and Sarawak is maintained by a fleet of seven coastal steamers and numerous small craft under 50 tons. Almost 5,000,000 gross tons of shipping used the ports of the Colony in 1956 and the quantity of cargo handled was 936,393 tons.

Broadcasting

The North Borneo Broadcasting Service (Radio Sabah) was inaugurated in November, 1955, and a daily 5-hour programme is transmitted in Chinese (Kuo-yu and Hakka), Malay and English, whilst a half-hour Dusun programme introduced in late 1956 is broadcast six days a week. The 5 kW. HF transmitter, giving Colony-wide coverage and a 250 W. MF transmitter serving the Jesselton area are located, at Kepayan, five miles from Jesselton. There are approximately 7,000 wireless licence holders in the Colony.

Principal Occupations

The 1951 census showed that 82,998 persons were engaged in smallholding agriculture, the bulk of whom were natives engaged in padi planting on their own account. Figures for other occupations were: rubber production 23,331; commerce 6,037; fishing 5,452; Government services (not including Railway Department) 4,225; timber 3,637; coconut, copra and coconut oil production 3,373; transport and communications 2,345; firewood and cutch 1,821; building 1,642.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are rubber, coconuts, rice and hemp. A high grade cigar wrapper leaf is grown for export by one large estate and a coarse variety of tobacco is cultivated as a village industry.

The estimated livestock population is: pigs 100,000; buffaloes 100,000; cattle 25,000; goats 30,000; ponies 3,500; poultry 4,000,000. A cattle farm, on co-operative lines, has been established.

The total output of timber in 1956 expressed in cubic feet quarter-girth round measurement was 21,152,102 cubic feet.

Investigations are being made into increasing fresh water fish production; 589 ponds have already been constructed and stocked, with promising results.

A geological survey is being undertaken by a team of experts to determine the mineral wealth of the country and a large oil company is prospecting for oil.

| 1956 | 117·4               | 120·9               |

Original sources of imports are difficult to state on account of the territory's dependence on supplies from the entrepot markets of Singapore and Hong Kong. Similarly it is not possible to determine accurately the ultimate destination of all the Colony's exports.

During 1956 imports by countries of origin and exports by countries of destination were:

**Imports.—U.K. accounted for 25%, other Commonwealth countries 22%, Foreign countries, 53%.**

**Exports.—U.K. received 23%, other Commonwealth countries 34%, Foreign countries 43%.**
