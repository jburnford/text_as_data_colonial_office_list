HONG KONG

Area
The land area is approximately 391 square miles (Hong Kong Island 32 square miles, Kowloon 34 square miles, Stonecutters Island 1 square mile, New Territories (leased) 355 square miles). British waters comprise a rectangular area of some 738 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory and bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

Population
The population of the Colony in December 1956 was estimated to be 2,535,000, of whom the overwhelming majority are of Chinese race, many being British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. The number of Europeans and Americans permanently resident, excluding Service personnel and their families, is about 21,000, including some 14,000 British subjects from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, 1,770 Portuguese, excluding those of British nationality, and approximately 5,230 other aliens.

Principal Towns
The overwhelming majority of the population lives on Hong Kong Island or in Kowloon, each of which is estimated to contain about 1,000,000 people. The capital is Victoria, on Hong Kong Island.

The principal centres of population in the New Territories are Tsuen Wan (50,000), which has recently grown into an important industrial centre with large textile, enamel and rubber factories, iron works, etc.; Cheung Chau (23,000), a small but densely populated island, important as a market and fishing centre; Yuen Long (16,000), a mainland market town; Tai O (13,000), a fishing and market centre on Lantao Island; Tai Po (9,000) and Shek Wu Hui (5,000), both mainland market towns; and Ping Chau (4,000), an island fishing port, with some industries.

Geographical Features
The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with 198 adjacent islands ranging from Lantao with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside, in some parts covered with dense scrub, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.

A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain—Taimoshan, 3,140 feet; Lantao Peak is 3,061 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,805 feet high.

Climate
The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84·76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

History
Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters' Island in the harbour, Aplichau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

Constitution
The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community.
The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, four of whom are Chinese and one Portuguese. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of six officials and 16 unofficials, eight of whom are elected.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).
(b) Salaries Tax.
(c) Interest Tax.
(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1957-58 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is normally only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries Tax is levied on net income from employment after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($7,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $5,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $43,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged at one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6¼%) on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony, other than in the New Territories.

Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax, as is the case under Salaries Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2½% in the case of estates valued between $5,000 and $10,000, and 52½% in the case of estates valued at over $30 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainment, Betting and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor, toilet preparations and table waters.

In 1956-57, $164,424,637 was raised from direct and indirect taxes, $97,299,299 from Duties and $56,706,452 from Rates. For the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

| Expenditure          | Amount       |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Public Works         | $155,982,105 |
| Police               | $39,467,256  |
| Subventions          | $42,772,652  |
| Medical              | $30,048,868  |

The Public Debt of the Colony on 31st March, 1957, amounted to $72,963,720 (approximately $32·43 per head of population). This Public Debt comprises:

- 3¼% Dollar Loan (1934)—$1,480,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3¼% Dollar Loan (1940)—$4,243,000 (1/25th redeemable annually).
- 3¼% Rehabilitation Loan (1947-48)—$46,666,000 (Sinking Fund of $14,172,778).
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes—$649,600.
- U.K. Government Loan for Kai Tak Airport Development—$19,925,120.

Currency

The value of the HK$, at approximately HK $.1 = £s. 3d., is kept stable in relation to the £ sterling by an Exchange Equalization Fund.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to a small extent by two other Banks, and of $1 notes and nickel alloy 50 cent, 10 cent and 5 cent coins.

Development Plans

Over the next five or six years it is proposed to expend about $425 million on major development projects, $47 million of which will be provided from the Colony's Development Fund (mainly on housing), $48 million from loans, and the balance from General Revenues.

The main items to be financed from current revenue are as follows:

| Item                          | Amount   |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| New Schools                   | $80      |
| New Hospitals and Clinics     | $80      |
| City Hall                     | $20      |
| Piers and Reclaimations       | $18      |
| Waterworks                    | $50      |
| New Abattoir                  | $23      |
| Kai Tak Airport               | $105     |

(including $48 million interest-free loan from Her Majesty's Government).

Education

In 1957 education was provided in 1,213 schools for over 333,000 pupils. This figure represents approximately one in eight of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Primary: 265,000
- Secondary: 55,000
- Post-secondary: 12,000

Private schools provided places for some 205,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 94,000; while 54 Government institutions catered for 33,000. There were over 1,200 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies, including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $55 million as compared with $24 million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1939 | $41,478,053 | $37,949,116 |
| 1951-52 | $308,564,248 | $275,855,951 |
| 1952-53 | $484,590,446* | $411,749,658* |
| 1953-54 | $396,881,966 | $355,407,770 |
| 1954-55 | $434,452,321 | $373,343,609 |
| 1955-56 | $454,720,189 | $402,463,642 |
| 1956-57 | $509,682,511 | $469,544,298 |

* Includes a contribution of $100 million charged to Expenditure and credited to Revenue as a contribution to the newly constituted Revenue Equalization Fund.
The University of Hong Kong has 834 students in the following faculties—arts, science, medicine, engineering and architecture. The annual Government grant to the University has been increased to $5 million, and, in addition, an annual capital grant of up to $3 million is to be made available by Government.

Libraries

Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council library and a small educational library at the Education Department. Various clubs have well-stocked libraries for the use of their members.

Health

The Health division undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and the inspection and treatment of school children. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda, the registration of births and deaths and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work.

The Government maintains and operates eleven general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to seven other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony ten private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups (as on 31st March, 1957) are 1,999, 2,477 and 1,172 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1956 totalled over 117,400, and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were just over 764,000. There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

The general state of health is very good; there were no major epidemics during 1956.

The most serious scourge is tuberculosis; 12,155 cases were notified in 1956 with 21·6% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned over 3,500 deaths; infant mortality was 60·9 per 1,000 live births.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1956-57 amounted to approximately $37½ million, compared with $2 million in 1937.

Communications

Air.—Kai Tak Airport is limited in size by the geographical features of the neighbourhood, but international traffic continues to increase steadily. Sixteen companies operate regular international flights through the Colony. Principal aircraft types are Britannia 102, Viscount 701, DC-4, DC-6, DC-6B, Canadair 749A (Constellation) and Convair 340. During 1956, 7,469 international flights by commercial aircraft carried 180,054 passengers, 2,914 tons of freight and 769 tons of mail, in addition to transit traffic.

Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1956 amounted to 215,726 tons, and 4,879,626 passengers were carried.

Roads.—There are 463 miles of roadway, 94% of which is of metalled construction.

Shipping.—41,040 vessels entered and cleared during 1956-57, their net registered tonnage being 26,838,878; 1,301,227 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. Frequent ferry services cross the harbour and link the principal islands to the westward.

Sound and Television Broadcasting

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW.) from two separate stations, in English and four Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 24 kW. There were 58,737 licence holders at the end of 1956. Rediffusion (Hong Kong), Limited, operate a wired broadcasting service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1956 there were some 49,384 subscribers to the service. In May, 1957, Rediffusion also began to operate a wired television service.

Principal Occupations

Before the war, most of the urban population was engaged in commerce, but since 1948 there has been a significant growth of local industries. In June, 1957, there were 147,120 workers in 3,329 registered and recorded factories and workshops; 56,365 of them were women. Another 100,000 people are estimated to be employed in smaller cottage-type industries and as outworkers. Reliable statistics of unemployment and under-employment are not obtainable; employment is liable to fluctuation during any year. Few rural families live entirely off the land, farmers' budgets being supplemented by remittances from family members overseas or working in urban jobs in Hong Kong and Kowloon. There is a large fishing population, most of which lives permanently afloat.

Figures for the main occupations are:

| Occupation                        | Number |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| Agriculture                       | 200,000|

- Iron ore: 122,963 tons
- Lead ore: 199 tons
- Graphite: 2,442 tons
- Wolfram ore: 24 tons
- Quartz and Feldspar: 3,005 tons

Cement produced for export and local use amounted to 118,807 tons in 1956.

Trade

Local industries are responsible for approximately 30% of all Hong Kong’s exports.

The following figures show exports of locally-manufactured goods during 1955 and 1956:

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are seventeen Vegetable Marketing Cooperative Societies with a membership of nearly 4,500. These seventeen Societies have federated and formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Cooperative Societies. In addition, two Irrigation Societies, two Salaried Workers’ Thrift and Loan Societies, one Consumers’ and Credit Society, one Fish Pond Society, fifty-one Housing Societies and thirty-four Pig Raising Societies have been formed. The last named have also federated and formed a Federation of Pig Raising Societies. Twenty-nine Fishermen’s Thrift and Loan Cooperative Societies have been formed and fishermen are gradually becoming aware of the benefits of co-operation. The total number of members of these Societies is 8,135.

The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market at Kowloon from co-operative societies and three collecting centres and two depots in the New Territories. The three centres are run by the farmers and are being encouraged to develop into co-operative societies.

Five Wholesale Fish Markets are operated by the Fish Marketing Organization, the latest having been opened in June, 1956, at Sha Tau Kok. A revolving loan fund with a present ceiling of $600,000 has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; over $3,800,000 has already been loaned from it. The Organization also operates schools for fishermen’s children, and provides education for over 1,700 students.
