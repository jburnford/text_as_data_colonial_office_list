THE LEEWARD ISLANDS
(see The West Indies (Federation) for Antigua, Montserrat, and St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla)

BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS

Area
The total area of the Colony is about 65 square miles. Excluding numerous small rocks, the islands number 36, of which 11 are inhabited. The largest are Tortola (20 square miles), Virgin Gorda (13 square miles), Anegada (11 square miles) and Jost van Dyke (7 square miles).

Population
The population at the 1946 census numbered 6,505; at 31st December 1956 it was estimated to number 7,760.

Principal Town
Road Town, Tortola (population 1,200), is the seat of the Administration.

Geographical Features
The Islands, except for Anegada, represent a projection of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands archipelago. Anegada, a flat coral feature of more recent geological formation, is the northern outpost of the group in the Atlantic, and is surrounded by dangerous reefs. Virgin Gorda and Tortola rise abruptly like the tops of submerged mountains from a submarine plateau of 20-30 fathoms of water. The highest elevation is 1,780 feet on Sage Mountain, Tortola, where the remnants of an interesting xerophytic rain forest still exist; Virgin Peak on Virgin Gorda is 1,370 feet high.

Climate
The climate of the group is particularly healthy. The average annual rainfall at Road Town, the capital, on the south-east of Tortola, is 49 inches. The average temperature in winter is 71°-82°F, and in summer 78°-88°F.

History
In 1648 a party of Dutch buccaneers are said to have set up their abode at Soper's Hole, Tortola, but were driven out by a party of English adventurers in 1666. In 1672 Colonel Stapleton, Governor of the Leeward Islands, took Tortola from the Dutch, who were then in possession. It was not, however, until 1680, according to Suckling's historical account of the Virgin Islands, that the islands were permanently settled by English planters from Anguilla; they have been uninterruptedly British since then. In 1773 the Settlers were granted a charter and the first House of Assembly was convened the following year.

Constitution
The Administrator, who is the chief executive, administers the Government under the Governor of the Leeward Islands. The Administrator is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of himself as the ex officio member (when the Governor is present) and two official and three unofficial Members. The Virgin Islands Constitution Act, 1950, under which the legislature was constituted, was replaced by the Virgin Islands Constitution and Elections Ordinance, 1954, which provides for a Legislative Council with an elected majority elected on a constituency basis by universal adult suffrage. The Legislative Council consists of the Administrator as President, two nominated official members, two nominated non-official members and six elected members. The Council elects at its first meeting a Deputy President who presides in the absence of the Administrator.
Land Policy

Aliens cannot hold land except under licence from the Governor.

The total area of Crown lands is estimated at 18,000 acres. Most of it is situated in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. In Anegada, where the soil is poor, the occupants of Crown lands are allowed the use of those lands free of charge but rentals are collected from occupants of Crown lands elsewhere, where there is good soil fertility. Arrangements exist for the sale of Crown lands to occupants in the islands of Anegada and Virgin Gorda. Non-natives own approximately 2,648 acres of the total land area of the Colony. The prevailing type of tenure for all holdings is fee simple.

Taxation

Taxes consist mainly of Customs duties and land, house, road, animal, boat and income taxes. Import duties average 12% ad valorem at general rates and 8% ad valorem at preferential rates. Export duties are fixed at specific rates which average less than 5% at current market values.

The income tax rate upon the chargeable income of every person other than a company, ranges from 6d. to 13s. 6d. in the £. Companies pay a flat rate of 5s. 6d. in every £.

Provision is made for a grant by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the Colony.

Currency

The currency is issued by the Commissioners of Currency, British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group), and consists of notes of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, also silver and bronze coins, and United Kingdom silver and bronze coins. The dollar is valued at $4·80 = £1. United States currency circulates freely, and all values and prices are determined by it.

Development Plans

The Colony has been granted allocations totalling £106,000 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945, a further allocation of £100,000 for the period 1955-60, and a supplementary allocation of £100,000 from the reserve for the same period. Expenditure on schemes up to 1952 was undertaken mainly on school buildings, agricultural and livestock development, water supplies and health projects. Since 1953 a road construction programme has been in progress; additional staff has been recruited for the Public Works Department to carry out the programme, and road-making machinery and plant have been purchased. A radio-telephone system has been established between Road Town and West End, Virgin Gorda, Anegada and Jost Van Dyke and also between Road Town and St. Thomas, and a piped water supply installed in Road Town. An airfield is being constructed.

Education

There is one secondary school and one primary school maintained by Government, 12 denominational schools, which receive grants from Government funds, one private school and three community schools. In 1956 there were 1,017 male and 1,092 female pupils enrolled in all schools. Attendance was approximately 80·4% of enrolment.

The cost of primary education, except the provision and maintenance of denominational school buildings, is met from Government funds and in 1956 the sum of $73,814 was so expended, compared with $3,446 in 1938.

Libraries

There is a Library in Road Town, said to be the best of the small libraries in the British Caribbean. There are library deposit stations in the out-islands. In 1956 the Library had a total of 10,578 books and 1,128 registered borrowers.

Health

The Tortola Cottage Hospital has 35 beds, and a total of 527 out-patients received treatment during 1956. There were 568 in-patients. The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1956 was $56,474 compared with $2,592 in 1938.

Communications

An airfield, suitable for small aircraft, is under construction on Beef Island.

Launches maintain a mail and passenger service with St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, whence air, sea and cable communications exist to all parts of the world. Through-bookings can be obtained at St. Thomas to almost any destination in Europe or the western hemisphere.

There is no broadcasting service in the Colony.

The Principal Occupation is stock-raising. Others are fishing, and the production of food crops and charcoal.

The Main Food Crops are vegetables and fruit.

The estimated livestock population is:—cattle 5,500, sheep 2,200, goats 9,000, swine 4,000. The fishing industry is unorganized.
