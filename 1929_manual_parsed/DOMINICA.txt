DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 304½ square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque, rising at Innray's View, the culminating point of Morne Diablotin to 4,747 feet. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters and adventurers settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of 312,092. 11s. ld. sterling. The French settlers were generously secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed a unit of a General Government, which comprised Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, a Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval expedition against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of it on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was appointed Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783 the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795 another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican leader, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1806, now referred to in the island for marking the time of events, by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy 12,000l. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Rupert's, near the town of Portsmouth.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Riots occurred in 1893, in the district of La Plaine on the Windward Coast of the island, in connection with the collection of taxes. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Com-
mission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of £15,000 by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island.

Considerable areas in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the Maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is good and the climate healthy. Limes and cacao flourish throughout the coastal zone, and the higher slopes in the centre of the island are well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, nutmeg, spices and such tropical fruits that require humid conditions.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, volcanic ash covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers, with fish in some, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Lime-juice, cocoa, coconuts, copra, and fruit (including green limes) are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, has now ceased to be made. A considerable trade is carried on also in spices, oils, and timber. 1927: cocoas, 18,556l.; limes and lime juice, 67,213l.; coconuts, 1,478l.; essential oils, 55,384l.; vanilla, 383l.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1927 was 80.95 inches; the average for the whole island was 126.90 inches; the mean temperature 79.4 Fahr.

The chief town is Roseau, with a population of 6,803 according to the census of April, 1921: it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1927, 14 vessels, of a total tonnage of 235 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north-west of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of Barclays Bank (Dominions, Colonial and Overseas) at Roseau, and one of the Royal Bank of Canada, established in April, 1916.

There is a Government telephone system of 542 miles, with 7 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 8 members. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. A Legislative council was created, consisting of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. Ordinance No. 21 of 1924 provides for the election of four of the unofficial members of the council. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

A considerable number of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the use of English is becoming general.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1298, 1902).

According to the Census of 1921 there are about 420 Caribs in the Island, of whom about 141 are estimated as of pure blood.

Montserrat.

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32 square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Chance's Mtn. (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,730, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1927, 4 sailing vessels, total tonnage 134 tons net.

Montserrat was colonised by the Irish in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1783.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. In 1861, these were replaced by a single Chamber of eight elected and four nominated members.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, this Chamber was replaced by a Legislative Council of not more than six nominated members. By Act No. 2, of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, the number of members was limited to four. Ordinance No. 4 of 1909 repealed No. 2 of 1902 and limited the tenure of office of the members of the Council to three years. Ordinance No. 2 of 1911 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number of members to six. Ordinance No. 18 of 1922 amended No. 4 of 1909 and increased the number to eight. Unofficial representation on the General Legislative Council of the L.I. has now been provided for.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, has declined, and onions and cotton are now the principal products. The lime cultivation, which was considerably extended recently, has suffered a severe set back by the hurricane of 12th-13th September, 1928.

The cultivation of Sea Island cotton, which was once grown during the American Civil War, was re-introduced in 1901, and, where the lands are suitable, has superseded the sugar industry.

Approximately 6 tons of tobacco were produced in the island during 1925.

Among the other exports may be mentioned a drug known as "papain," essential oils, lime juice, cotton-seed oil and cattle.

There are eight Anglican schools with 1,478 scholars, three Wesleyan with 759, one Roman Catholic with 217, and one undenominational with 263 scholars.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a hurricane; and again on 28th August, 1924, and 12th September, 1928.

On 27th September, 1920, H.R.H. the Prince of Wales visited Montserrat.

There is telephonic communication throughout the Island; a Wireless Station was erected in 1925.

The island is considered to be one of the most healthy of the Antilles. Death-rate 1927, 15·18 per 1,000. Birth-rate 1927, 40·11 per 1,000.

The rainfall in 1926, was 61·09 inches at Grove station; and the mean temperature was dry bulb 81·3°, wet bulb 74·1°.
