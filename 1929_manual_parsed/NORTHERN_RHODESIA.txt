NORTHERN RHODESIA.†

Situation and Area.

Northern Rhodesia comprises the northern part
of the Territory formerly administered by
the British South Africa Company, whose principal
field of operations was defined in the Charter of
Incorporation as "the region of South Africa
lying immediately to the North of British
Bechuanaland, and to the North and West of the
South African Republic, and to the West of the
Portuguese dominions." It lies wholly to the
north of the Zambesi River and is bounded by
Tanganyika Territory and the Belgian Congo on
the north; Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa
on the east; Southern Rhodesia and South-West
Africa on the south and Portuguese West Africa
on the west.

The area of the Territory is estimated at about
287,950 square miles.

A map of Northern Rhodesia and Southern
Rhodesia will be found in the section relating to
the latter.

Northern Rhodesia is divided into nine magis-
terial districts for fiscal and administrative pur-
poses. The seat of government is at Livingston,
situated seven miles from the Victoria Falls.
Other important settlements are at Broken Hill,
the centre of the mining industry, Fort Jameson,
Lusaka, Mazabuka, Ndola near which the copper
mines of Bwana Mkuwa are situated, Abercorn,
Kasama, Fort Rosebery and Mongu-Lealui in
Barotseland.

History and Constitution.

In 1855, Dr. Livingstone, the great explorer,
with whose advent the authentic history of Nor-
thern Rhodesia may be said to begin, arrived at
the Zambesi near the place where the town bearing
his name now stands. The Arab slave trade had
begun a few years before Livingstone's arrival and
flourished from that time onwards till 1893,
twenty years after the death of Livingstone at
Chitambo. The Arab influence was at first most
felt in the North but soon extended over the
whole country. It was not until 1893, by which
time a Government post (Abercorn) near the south
of Lake Tanganyika, and several mission stations
were established, that this trade received any
check. Blow after blow was inflicted by the
destruction of the Arab settlements on Lake
Nyass, and with the defeat of the Arab chief
Mlozi by Sir Harry Johnston at Karonga in 1894,
the days of the slave trade in British Central
Africa were numbered. The last caravan of slaves
in Northern Rhodesia (interception on its way to
the East coast via Lake Nyass) was released at
Fort Jameson, which had just been established,
in 1898. An account of the early operations of
the British South Africa Company under the
Royal Charter of Incorporation of 1889 will be
found under the section relating to Southern
Rhodesia. Prior to 1911 the territory now called
Northern Rhodesia consisted of two separate
territories (a) Barotseland-North-Western Rhos-
desia and (b) North-Eastern Rhodesia. On the 4th
May of that year these two territories were amal-
gamated under the title of Northern Rhodesia.
Mr. (now Sir) Lawrence Wallace was appointed
the first Administrator of the combined territory,
and continued in office until 1921.

Several engagements took place during the
great war with forces from German East Africa,
and on the 2nd May, 1916, General Northey
ordered a general advance into German East
Africa of the troops under his command, and by
July all enemy territory adjacent to the Northern
Rhodesia border had been cleared of the enemy.
Towards the end of October, 1918, the fugitive
German force, under Colonel Von Lettow-Vorbeck
doubled southwards, and on the 1st November
made an unsuccessful attack on the frontier
station, Fife. From there they proceeded south-
west to Kasama, the advanced base of supplies
for the forces operating on the border. The bulk
of the stores had, however, been evacuated on the
first news of the enemy's advance. After burning
most of the buildings and their remaining contents,
Von Lettow marched along the Kasama-Kashitu
motor-road, and early on the 13th November, his
advanced parties opened fire on the British South
Africa Company's rubber factory on the Chamberi
River. At this juncture the news of the Armistice
was received by the District Commissioner
and communicated to Von Lettow, who accepted
the position and suspended hostilities. The number
of individual Rhodesians (men and women) known
to have undertaken duties in connection with the
war was 7,009. Of these 6,859 served with H.M.
Forces during the war, 459 being from Northern
Rhodesia. 791 were killed in action or died of
wounds or disease.

In March, 1921, Sir Drummond Chaplin, Ad-
ministrator of Southern Rhodesia, became also
Administrator of Northern Rhodesia. He re-
linquished office on the 20th September, 1923,
and was succeeded by Mr. R. A. J. Goode as
Acting Administrator in Northern Rhodesia.

In July, 1923, a settlement was arranged of the
various outstanding questions relating to the
British South Africa Company's position in
Southern and Northern Rhodesia. As far as
Northern Rhodesia was concerned, the effect of the settlement, which was conditional on its acceptance by the shareholders and the approval of Parliament, was that the Company surrendered its buildings and assets used for administrative purposes, and its land and monopoly rights other than mineral rights under its concessions in Northern Rhodesia but retained three freehold areas in the Tanganyika District of North-Eastern Rhodesia; on the other hand the Company would receive on the 1st October, 1923, a cash payment from His Majesty's Government, and would retain a half interest for 40 years in the net proceeds of the disposal of land in North-Western Rhodesia, such disposal to be in the hands of the administration of the territory; the Company would receive the Crown's recognition of its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia and a considerable measure of protection for its railway interests; and the Crown would waive its whole claim against the Company in respect of extraordinary military expenditure incurred in the course of the Great War. Subject to the foregoing, the Company would retain the whole of its commercial rights and assets; no further question would be raised as to any liability of the Company in respect of land appropriated for the purpose of its own commercial undertakings or granted to other parties; and the Company would be relieved of the duty of carrying on the administration of Northern Rhodesia. This provisional arrangement was unanimously approved by the shareholders, and on the 26th July, 1923, was approved by the House of Commons.

By Orders in Council dated 20th February, 1924 the office of Governor of Northern Rhodesia was created, an Executive Council constituted and provision made for the constitution of a Legislative Council. The Executive Council is composed of the Governor as President, the Chief Secretary to the Government, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, the Secretary for Native Affairs and the Principal Medical Officer. The Legislative Council comprises the Governor as President, the members of the Executive Council, ex officio, four nominated official members and five unofficial elected members. On the 1st April, 1924, Mr. H.J. Stanley, C.M.G. (now Sir Herbert Stanley, K.C.M.G.), assumed office as the first Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Northern Rhodesia.

Administrative and Judicial.

The natives are administered as far as possible through their own chiefs or headmen. Administrative and judicial functions are combined in the District officers. The Barotse District is a native reserve, and is administered under conditions differing in some respects from those obtaining elsewhere. The Paramount Chief of the Barotse has a Khotla or Native Council to assist him.

The law of the Territory is that of England except in so far as it may be inapplicable or may have been or may hereafter be modified by legislation, but no Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom passed subsequent to the 17th August, 1911, is deemed to apply to the Territory unless it has been specifically applied. The Civil jurisdiction of Native Commissioners' Courts is limited to causes or matters concerning natives. They also have criminal jurisdiction over natives with limitations. Appeals, both civil and criminal, lie from Native Commissioners' Courts to Magistrates, and from Magistrates' Courts to the High Court.

### Population

| Year | European Male | European Female | European Total | Native Male | Native Female | Native Total |
|------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1911 | 1,121         | 376             | 1,497          | -           | -            | 621,102      |
| 1921 | 2,263         | 1,371           | 3,634          | 447,841     | 532,064      | 979,905      |

The European population at the 31st December, 1927, was computed as 7,275, comprising 3,492 adult males, 1,908 adult females and 1,875 children. The native population was estimated to be 1,237,486.

### Education

**European.**—For the education of European children, there were, in 1928, Government Schools at Livingstone, Choma, Mazabuka, Lumka, Broken Hill and Fort Jameson. At all of these, with the exception of the school at Fort Jameson, primary education up to Standard VII was given, with the additional subjects, Latin, French, Algebra in Standards VI and VII and Geometry in Standard VII. At Fort Jameson primary education was given up to Standard V. Three Farm Schools were open during the year at Silver Rest, Chilongoalo and Lubombo, 3 mine school at Bwana M'Kubwa, Roan Antelope and N'Changa and 2 aided schools Kalomo and the M'tuga Mine. In all of these education was given up to Standard V.

The Beit School at Choma, which has been built to provide a separate girls' boarding school, was opened in July; the girls who had previously boarded at the Codrington School, Mazabuka, were transferred and the latter became a boarding school for boys.

**Native.**—With the exception of the Barotse National School at Mongu which is under Government control, the actual education of the natives is in the hands of the Missionary Societies. A Director of Native Education has been appointed, and a system of Government Grants-in-aid to Missionary Societies who agree to conform to the general educational policy of the Government has been instituted. An Advisory Board in Native Education has been set up, upon which missionaries, settlers, and Government Departments are represented. A central agricultural research station at which native agricultural and veterinary demonstrators can be trained is under construction.

### Climate.

The climate, except in the low-lying parts, may be described as sub-tropical. Temperatures are moderate during the winter months, viz., from April to August. In low-lying parts the mean temperature varies from $70^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ with a maximum of $103^\circ$ and a minimum of $56^\circ$. In the high plateau the mean temperature varies from $85^\circ$ to $75^\circ$ with a maximum of $86^\circ$ and a minimum of $40^\circ$. In some parts the maximum temperature has been known to reach the high figure of $120^\circ$, whilst minima round about $30^\circ$ are not infrequent.

As a whole the country may be said to be suitable for white settlement, and Europeans have little to fear from the point of view of health if reasonable precautions are taken.

The average rainfall varies from 50 inches in the northern and high-lying portions of the territory to 25 and 30 inches only in the southern...
Commerce and Industry.

Farming and ranching occupy a considerable portion of the European inhabitants.

Maize is the chief crop, and the demand for this is steadily increasing, and the prices obtained have been most satisfactory.

The cultivation of cotton received a severe check some two years ago by reason of the damage caused by insect pests and fungoid diseases. Experiments are being actively carried out with a view to obtaining a new, or improved, variety which will be suitable to local conditions. The results obtained up to date are such that a considerable feeling of optimism obtains as to the future of cotton growing in the Territory.

During the season 1926-27 over 3,000,000 lbs. of tobacco was produced in the Territory, the greater portion being grown in the Fort Jameson district. The variety grown, a strain of Virginia, produces high grade leaf which has, in the past, found a ready and remunerative market. At the moment, the glut in the tobacco market, caused by over-production of Empire leaf, is causing no small amount of embarrassment to planters. When market conditions have again become stabilised there would appear to be no reason why tobacco should not once more take its place as one of the most valuable and important crops. The amount of wheat produced is still far below local requirements. The establishment of a Co-operative Wheat Mill in the wheat area has made it possible for the crop to be converted into flour after a minimum amount of transport. Formerly, all wheat grown had to be exported to Southern Rhodesia for milling. Other crops are, groundnuts, beans, potatoes, and, to a smaller extent, citrus.

The requirements of the Territory are still greater than the supply of the majority of the crops grown, and an increase in the acreage of these and other crops for human consumption is obviously indicated. The increased population, resulting from the activities in connection with mining development, has caused a very much increased demand or foodstuffs of all varieties.

The dairy industry is small but is making steady progress. There is scope for greater increase in the production of dairy produce, as the Territory produces under a quarter of the requirements of the local demand and of those of the Belgian Congo. The balance is imported from the south.

The ranching industry is of considerable importance but it is quite incapable of supplying the demands made upon it. As a consequence, many thousands of cattle pass through Northern Rhodesia from Southern Rhodesia and N'Gamiland each year to supply the markets of the Belgian Congo. The estimated requirements of Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo, for slaughter cattle, are 43,000 head per annum.

A Central Veterinary and Agricultural Research Station is in the course of completion, and plant breeding, seed selection and demonstration work with crops have been commenced. A number of cattle have been obtained and these will form the foundation of a herd of pedigree cattle. The laboratory for veterinary and agricultural research is almost complete. The station will be of value to intending settlers who may wish to obtain further experience before commencing farming in the Territory, and will be used in training native demonstrators. In the vicinity of the station a school is being erected for training native industrial and agricultural artisans and demonstrators.

Land suitable for mixed farming and ranching is available within easy distance of the railway and the price ranges between 3s. and 16s. per acre depending upon the quality of the soil, water supply, distance from railway, etc. A settler must be in possession of at least £2,000 capital in order to obtain a grant of a farm from the Government on permit of occupation. Special travelling facilities are given to bona fide farm settlers and their wives and families proceeding to Northern Rhodesia for the first time to take up land, and special local railway rates are in force for their benefit. Applications for land in Northern Rhodesia should be addressed to the Lands Department, Livingstone.

During 1927 development at Broken Hill is said to have been satisfactory in proving lead and zinc ores; a treatment and hydro-electric plant for zinc metal production were completed and are now in full operation.

Bwana M Kubwa ammonite leaching treatment of oxidised copper ores has been showing improved results. Very large tonnages of sulphide ores of copper are being proved to the north and north-west of Bwana M Kubwa, notably at the Roan Antelope and the N'kans Mine.

These sulphides will offer no difficulty to concentration by flotation methods and are great assets. More gold has been found near Mumbwa in deposits probably richer and more extensive than hitherto known in the Territory.

In the year 1927, 352 ounces of gold, 54 ounces of silver, 3,289 tons of copper, 5,857 tons of lead, 16,913 lbs. of mica, 11 tons of vanadium and 326 tons of zinc were produced.

| Year | Exports | Imports |

| 1925 | 432,997 | 1,317,907 |
| 1926 | 490,382 | 1,725,682 |
| 1927 | 777,890 | 2,030,599 |

Included in the exports for the year 1927 were:

- Animals (living), 38,205l.; Hides, Skins and Horns, 21,844l.; Ivory, 8,214l.; Butter, 1,445l.; Maize, 59,711l.; Wheat, 13,546l.; Maize Meal, 18,437l.; Tobacco (unmanufactured), 240,668l.; Copper, 133,115l.; Lead, 88,652l.; Vanadium, 6,749l.; Gold, 1,690l.; Timber (unmanufactured), 8,993l.; Railway Sleepers, 26,540l.

Means of Communication.

The Railway was extended from Victoria Falls northward to Broken Hill—374 miles—in 1906, and the extension to the border of Northern Rhodesia, a further 132 miles, where it connects with the railway system of the Congo Belge, was completed in 1909. The Zambesi is crossed by a single span bridge, 850 feet long, 30 feet wide and about 420 feet high. The gauge of the railway is 3 feet 6 inches, the standard gauge of South Africa.

Legislation was passed in December, 1927, for the construction of a branch line from Bwana M Kubwa, on the main line, to the N'Kana Mine, a distance of approximately 45 miles. The line has been surveyed and negotiations are taking place regarding construction.

Legislation was also passed in May, 1928, for the construction of a branch line from Ndola on the
main line to the Roan Antelope Mine, a distance of approximately 23 miles. The construction of this line is well in hand.

Road communications are being opened up, and dry season motor tracks are now in use from Victoria Falls (via Livingstone, Lusaka and Broken Hill) to Elizabethville in the Congo Belge (790 miles approx.); Broken Hill to Abercorn (604 miles), and thence via Old Fife, on the border of Northern Rhodesia, to Tanganyika and Kenya Colony; this portion forming part of the Cape to Cairo Route. Lusaka and Fort Jameson are also connected by road, a distance of 375 miles.

The Zambesi, Kafue, Luapula and Chambesi Rivers are navigable for small boats for a considerable portion of their course, and where necessary for motor traffic, these and other rivers may be crossed by pontoons.

Aerodromes are situated at Livingstone, Broken Hill, Ndola and Abercorn.

Mails to and from England are despatched and received weekly via Bulawayo and Cape Town. Mails from and to Fort Jameson are carried via Beira and Nyasaland. There are 37 post offices in the Territory, 11 of which are money order offices. There is a telegraph line alongside the railway line from Livingstone to the Congo Border and other lines link up Abercorn and Fort Jameson with Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia. The total mileage of telegraphic line through the Territory is 2,350 miles.
