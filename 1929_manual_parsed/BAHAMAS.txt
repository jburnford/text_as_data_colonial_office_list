BAHAMAS.

Situation and Area.

The Bahamas, the most northerly of the British West Indian Colonies, are a chain of coral islands lying between 21° 42' and 27° 34' N. lat., and 72° 40' and 79° 5' W. long., composed of about 20 inhabited islands, and an immense number of islets and rocks. The principal islands are New Providence (containing the capital, Nassau), Abaco, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, Inagua, Cat Island, Ragged Island, Rum Cay, Exuma, Long Island, Long Cay, the Bimini's, and Watling's Island (or San Salvador), all of which are ports of entry; and Great Bahama, Crooked Island, Acklin Island, Mayaguana, the Berry Islands, and Andros Island (containing the only river). The total area is 4,403 square miles, or about half the size of Wales.

History.

San Salvador, so called by Columbus, the native name being Guanahani, one of the islands composing this chain, and identical with Watling's Island, was the first land discovered by him on his voyage in 1492. A few years later all the Carib inhabitants were transported to work in the Cuba mines. It does not appear that the Spaniards had any settlements on any of the islands of this group at any time. Early in the 17th century the islands were well known to the settlers of Bermuda and the Carolinas. They were included in the Royal Grant of Sir Robert Heath, the Attorney-General of England, of the 30th of October, 1629. By 1640 the islands had become a well-known place of resort by the inhabitants of Bermuda, and on the 9th of July, 1647, The Company of Eleutherian Adventurers was formed in London for the purpose of making an organised attempt at a systematic colonization and development of the islands. William Sayle, a former Governor of Bermuda, was the moving spirit of this venture, and associated with him were a number of influential city merchants and Members of Parliament. On the 31st of August, 1649, Parliament, on the petition of Sayle and others, passed "An Act for the Adventurers for the Eleutherian Islands," which constituted Sayle and his associates the Proprietors of the Islands. Notwithstanding the Royal Grant to Heath in 1629 and the Cromwellian Act of 1649, Charles the Second, on the 1st of November, 1670, granted the Islands to Six of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, namely, the Duke of Albermarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Berkley, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret and Sir Peter Colleton. Before the Royal Grant of 1670 the inhabitants of the islands had organised the Settlement and instituted a form of Government which included an elective House of Assembly, and had selected Captain John Wentworth as their Governor. Wentworth applied to and received Commissions from the Governors of Jamaica. The Lords Proprietors appointed Hugh Wentworth as their first Governor on 24th April, 1671, but he did not take up the appointment. They then confirmed in office John Wentworth, the popularly elected Governor, on the 26th of December, 1671. A regular system of government was established including a Parliament, the Lower House of which was elective, and this was continued with several breaks until the Civil and Military Government of the Islands was resumed by the Crown on the surrender of their rights by the Lords Proprietors on the 28th October, 1717. Thirteen Proprietary Governors were appointed between 1671 and 1715. The Settlement on New Providence was sacked by the Spaniards on several occasions between 1680 and 1684. In 1684 nearly all the inhabitants were driven away, and it was not until 1688 that the Settlement was re-formed by their return, principally from Jamaica, under the leadership of Thomas Bridges. Bridges was recognised as Governor by the Lords Proprietors on the 12th July, 1688, and the Settlement had reached some importance when it was practically annihilated by the French and Spaniards in 1703. However, a year or so after this the dispersed inhabitants returned to New Providence and another Proprietary Governor was appointed in 1707. But the Islands became a regular rendezvous for pirates, and this finally determined the Crown to resume the Civil and Military Government of the place, and thus accede to the numerous petitions which the inhabitants had been making for several years and also carry out the express wishes of Parliament. Since 1717 there has been a continuous line of Royal Governors. The Islands were surrendered to a Fleet of the American rebels in 1776, and again to the Spaniards in 1781, but they had been re-taken by a British force under Colonel Deveaux before the conclusion of the war, which was brought to an end by the Peace of Versailles, 1783, when the British possession was confirmed. After the American Revolution a number of Loyalists settled throughout the Bahamas Group and received substantial assistance from England, and on the 19th of March, 1787, the Lords Proprietors surrendered all their proprietary rights to the King for the sum of £12,000l., which was provided by Parliament.

The Turks and Caicos Islands, which geographically form part of the Bahamas chain, and which had often in their early history been claimed both by Bermuda and the Bahamas, were separated from the other Bahamas in 1848, and formed into a distinct Presidency, under the government-in-chief of the Governor of Jamaica.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is salubrious and very pleasant in the winter season, and the Colony has in recent years been much frequented by visitors from the United States and Canada, there being excellent hotels and other accommodation for tourists. The cost of living is very high; houses are difficult to obtain and rentals are high. The average annual rainfall for the past 19 years was 46 inches, the rainy season extending from June
to October. From November to May the temperature averages 70° Fahrenheit, there is little rain, and cool breezes prevail. The lowest recorded temperature (in January, 1905) is 51.5°. In the summer month temperatures as high as 92° have been recorded. Three severe hurricanes passed over the Bahamas in 1926, on 26th July, 17th September and 20th October, causing loss of life and great destruction to property and shipping.

The Colony was visited by two hurricanes in 1928, one in August, which only affected the Southern part of Andros, and the other in September, which severely affected New Providence, Bimini, Cat Island, Eleuthera and Harbour Island.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race. About one-sixth are of European descent. English is universally spoken.

Trade and Industry.

The commercial relations of the Colony are mainly with the United States. Considerable quantities of pine-apples (canned), sponges, sisal and tomatoes are exported. In 1927 the principal exports were:—Sisal, 596 tons, value 10,632l.; sponges, 8,570 cwts., value 109,203l.; lumber, 6,082,000 feet, value 49,854l.; pineapples, value 7l.; shell, value 13,775l.; tomatoes, 214,000 bushels, value 92,497l.; bark, value 1,651l.; salt, 53,000 bushels, value 725l.

The cultivation and preparation of the sisal fibre plant is an important industry. The estimated area planted at the end of 1926 was over 14,691 acres.

Fishing is extensively carried on for the Nassau market, about 70 native-built boats, with 270 men, being employed. Turtle-shell, shells and pearls are largely exported. Sponge-fishing employs a large fleet. The approximate number of vessels engaged in the industry is 476—aggregate tonnage 4,515—with 2,760 open boats, and a large number of long shore open boats; men and boys employed, 5,000.

Nassau is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1927, 171 vessels of 7,766 tons.

Principal imports during 1927: foodstuffs, value 376,923l.; malt, value 32,412l.; spirits and wines, value 664,862l.; tobaccos, cigars and cigarettes, value 20,926l.

Lighthouses on several of the islands have been established, and are maintained by the Imperial Government. Several lights are also maintained by the local government.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and United States current coin*. Accounts are kept in sterling. There is a branch bank of the Royal Bank of Canada with deposits amounting to 612,375l. A Post Office Savings Bank was established in January, 1886, and had, on 30th June, 1926, 23,684l. deposited.

Means of Communication.

There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony, and but few good roads except in New Providence and Eleuthers.

There are no direct passenger steamers between England and the Bahamas. The cheapest route is via Jamaica, by Elder and Fyffes line from Avonmouth to Kingston (14 days) and by the small steamers of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine from Kingston to Nassau (3 days). The quickest route is via New York, the journey from New York to Nassau taking only three days by the steamers of the Munson Line, which leave New York weekly in winter and fortnightly in summer.

The cargo steamers of the Frederick Leyland Co. (Liverpool) and Thomas and James Harrison Co. (Liverpool) lines leave every four weeks from Liverpool and Glasgow, proceeding to Bahamas via Bermuda. The cargo steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company sail for the Bahamas from London every three weeks.

There is also a regular contract Mail, Passenger and Freight Service during the winter months, from January to April, between Nassau and Miami, Florida. These vessels make two voyages a week in January and April, and three voyages a week in February and March.

Besides this Service there are motor boats plying almost daily between the ports of Miami and Nassau.

Till February, 1892, the nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe was Key West, but in that month a cable from Nassau to Florida was completed. The cable is not however at present in working order. Wireless stations have been installed at Nassau (New Providence), Harbour Island, Governor's Harbour (Eleuthers), Grand Bahama, Norman's Castle and Hope Town (Abaco), Inagua, Bimini and Long Island, Marsh Harbour (Abaco), San Salvador or Watlings, The Eight (Cat Island), Fresh Creek (Androo), George Town (Exuma), Long Cay (Fortune Island), Ragged Island and Rum Cay.

| U.K., and the Empire | 1d. per oz. | ½d. per 2 oz. |
| U.S. America | 1d. per 2 oz. | — |
| Other Foreign Postal Union | 2½d. per oz. & 1½d. for successive unit | ½d. per 2 oz. |

A parcel post with the United Kingdom (1s. 6d., 4s., 6s., 7s. 6d.) the United States (6d. per lb.) and Canada (6d. per lb.) has been established, and money order agreements have been made with the United States and Canada.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is conducted, under Letters Patent, by the Governor, aided by an Executive Council not exceeding 9 members. The Legislative authority resides in the Governor, a Legislative Council, nominated by the Crown, and a Representative Assembly of 29 members, elected for 15 districts. An elector must be of full age, and either the owner for 12 months of land of the value of £5 or a house-holder of premises value 2l. 8s. in New Providence, or 1l. 4s. elsewhere, for six months. The qualification of Members is possession of an estate of real or personal property of the value of 20l. The Executive Council is composed partly of official and partly of unofficial Members who have a seat in one of the branches of the Legislature. In the absence of the Governor the Senior Member of the Executive Council administers the Government.

Education.

There is a Government system of elementary education established in 1847, and modified by laws of 1864, 1875, 1888, and Consolidating Act of 1908. The central control is in a Board of Education nominated by the Governor. Local Committees, partly elected, exercise local supervision only.
There are 51 unsectarian Government schools, with 6,601 scholars; 62 aided schools, with 3,392 scholars; 8 Church of England schools, with 275 scholars; 6 private schools, with 86 scholars; 10 Roman Catholic schools, with 912 scholars; 1 Wesleyan Methodist school, with 81 scholars; 5 Secondary schools, with 321 scholars. The Government schools were made free in 1886. The compulsory clauses of the law are enforced only in Nassau and the larger villages. Higher education is provided at the Queen's College, St. Hilda's School, Government High School, and Diocesan Western School, all in Nassau.
