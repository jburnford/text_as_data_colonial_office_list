BRITISH HONDURAS.

Situation and Area.

British Honduras is a Colony on the east coast of Central America, bounded on the north by Yucatan, on the west by a straight line drawn from the rapids of Gracias a Dios on the River Saratoon, to Garbutt's Falls on the River Belize, and thence due north to the Mexican frontier, on the south of Guatemala, and on the east by the Bay of Honduras. It lies between 18°-29 and 18°-54 N. latitude and 89°-15 and 87°-50 W. longitude.

The area of the Colony is 8,598 square miles, about the size of Wales, including Albion Island in the River Hondo (about 26 square miles), and Ambergris, St. George's, English, Turneffe and other Cayas (Islands). 212 square miles, a large portion of the latter being mangrove swamps without any soil. It is estimated that about 165 square miles are under cultivation.

History.

The coast was discovered in 1502 by Columbus, and its early settlement is supposed to have been effected from Jamaica, about 1638, by adventurers, who were attracted by the logwood which grew on the banks of the Hondo and other rivers. Their headquarters were long at St. George's Cay. The name of the present chief town and of the River Belize is alleged to be a corruption of the name of the buccaneer Wallis, who was driven from Hispaniola in that year, and who is said to have been the leader of the settlers. The Spaniards frequently endeavoured to expel the logcutters; but, though they succeeded in driving them from the northern coast of Yucatan about 1717, they failed to dislodge them from the eastern coast.

An earlier settlement had been made by a chartered company, of which the Earl of Warwick was chairman and John Pym treasurer, on two small islands off the Mosquito coast, in 1630. The Mosquito natives were very friendly to the English settlers, and their king, shortly after the conquest of Jamaica, placed himself under English protection, and the Governors of Jamaica exercised a sort of supervision over the affairs of the settlement. In 1739 the native king made a treaty resigning his country to Great Britain, and forts were built in 1742 at the Island of Rutan, and at Black River on the mainland. Rutan was abandoned in 1749, but at the same time an officer was formally appointed by the Government of Jamaica to superintend the settlements on the Mosquito Coast. As a result of the treaty of Paris in 1763, the forts were dismantled and the garrisons withdrawn. The settlers remained, however, and from that date until 1798, when the last attempt to establish the sovereignty of Spain over the territory was defeated by the inhabitants in the "Battle of St. George's Cay," the Spaniards made frequent but ineffectual attempts to expel the woodcutters by force of arms. By the Treaty of Versailles of 1783 Spain recognised a district (within what is now British Honduras) within which the British logcutters might work without interference; and by the Convention of London signed in 1786, it was agreed that the British Colonists should evacuate the Mosquito Coast and the adjacent islands. In spite of these treaties, many of the settlers remained outside the agreed limits; and it was not until the treaties of 1859 with the Republic of Honduras and 1860 with Nicaragua that the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast were finally recognised as belonging to those States, Nicaragua agreeing to allow the Mosquito Indians autonomy in the Reserve which was assigned to them.

The only other events of external significance which need here be noticed are the definition, as above, of the boundaries of the Colony (of which a survey has been partially executed); and the frequent border troubles, connected with the revolt in 1849 of the Indian population of Yucatan against the Spanish inhabitants, the result of which was that the Indians were in possession of the country to a considerable distance north of the Hondo until 1901, when the Mexicans subjugated them. Occasional incursions into the Colony were made from time to time by the Indians, the last being in 1872, by the Icaché tribe on the N.W. frontier.
Constitution.

The first settlers from 1638 to 1786 managed their own affairs. Persons were annually elected to act as Magistrates at public meetings held for the purpose. These Magistrates discharged all executive and judicial functions. Resolutions were passed at public meetings, and they formed the laws binding on the community. In 1765 these customs were formally recognised by the King's Government, after the visit of Admiral Sir William Burnaby to the settlement in that year. The customs of the settlers were codified and published, and became known as "Burnaby's Laws."

In 1786 a Superintendent was appointed by the Home Government, but during the years 1790-1797 elected Magistrates again ruled the settlements. From this latter date Superintendents were regularly appointed until 1862. An Executive Council was established in 1839 to assist the Superintendent, and in 1853 a Legislative Assembly was formally constituted, consisting of 18 elected and 3 nominated members. The settlement was declared a Colony on the 12th May, 1862, and a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed subordinate to the Governor of Jamaica. In 1870 the Legislative Assembly was abolished by a local enactment, and a Legislative Council substituted therefor, consisting of five official, and not less than four unofficial, members, with the Lieutenant-Governor as President. Since 1913 the Council contains five official and seven unofficial members.

On the 31st October, 1884, Letters Patent were proclaimed constituting the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief, which rendered the Colony independent of Jamaica. These were renewed by Letters Patent proclaimed on the 10th September, 1909.

The English Common Law and all statutes of the Imperial Parliament "in abrogation or derogation or in any way declaratory of the Common Law passed before 1899 extend to the Colony as far as local circumstances render such extension suitable, and subject to modification by Colonial ordinances." Pursuant to Ordinance No. 31 of 1923, a new and revised edition of the Laws of this Colony has been published in two volumes. This edition, referred to as "The Consolidated Laws, 1924," came into force on the 4th February, 1925, and supersedes the revised edition published in 1915 and all ordinances passed before July, 1924. Appeals to His Majesty in Council are regulated by Chapter 155 of the Consolidated Laws, 1924.

The Executive Council consists of the Governor, and seven members, three of whom are ex officio, the other four being appointed members.

For administrative purposes the Colony is divided into six districts—Belize, which includes the capital at the mouth of the river of the same name; the Corozal district; the Orange Walk district; the Cayo district; the Stann Creek district; and the Toledo district, the main station of which is Punta Gorda.

General Description.

In its physical outlines the Colony resembles other parts of Central America, the land being flat and swampy throughout the greater portion of the coast line, and gradually rising as the interior is approached. The characteristic soils of the Colony are known as Cahoon ridge (the vegetable alluvium along the river valleys), the Pine ridge (sandy tracts covered with pines, scrub, and wiry grass), and Broken ridge (intermediate between these two). Besides these there are swamp, savannah, and mountain.

The chief rivers are in the north of the Colony, and run in a north-easterly direction, the Belize reaching the sea on the east, and the Hondo and the New River on the north.

The northern district, of which the Hondo forms the natural boundary, is but little raised above the sea; but towards the south the character of the country becomes more elevated, until in the Cockscomb Mountains a height of some 4,000 feet is attained. That district of the Colony remained until 1879 wholly unexplored, when it was traversed by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr. Fowler, from Garbutt's Falls on the Belize River, at the western frontier, to the sea coast south of Deep River. The country proved to be a succession of valleys and hills, from 1,200 to 3,000 feet above sea level. The westerly portion was an open undulating grassy country, forming magnificent pasturage lands. Towards the coast it was all forest, full of valuable timber. No inhabitants were seen, but ancient Indian ruins, consisting of large stone buildings, were discovered. The soil generally was rich, but a few rugged spots were encountered. Some fine gold-bearing quartz veins were discovered, and other indications of minerals were noticed.

In 1888 Governor Sir R. Goldsworthy, with an exploring party, ascended the Cockscomb Mountains.

Industry.

For more than 200 years the Colony has subsisted mainly on the natural resources of its forests. In 1926, the percentage values of exports of domestic produce were forest produce 84, agricultural produce 14, and marine produce 2. A Forest Department has been in existence since 1922, and its finance is administered by a Forest Trust established for that purpose.

The chief items of export in 1927 were as follows:—Mahogany, 24,726,313 superficial feet; cedar, 733,088 superficial feet; secondary woods, 21,076 superficial feet; chicle, 3,029,210 lbs.; rosewood 137 tons; logwood, 332 tons; coconuts, 5,929,834; copra, 2,002,870 lbs.; bananas, 112,640 bunches; plantains, 210,800; grape fruit, 183,228; canned rock lobster, 2,922 cases; tortoiseshell, 2,751 lbs.

Belize is a port of registry, and there were registered on 31st December, 1927, 220 vessels aggregating 2,019 tons net.

The imports consist mainly of mahogany and chicle in transit, cotton goods, petroleum oils, hardware, haberdashery and millinery, boots and shoes, spirits, tobacco and provisions. The commercial intercourse is mainly with the United States the United Kingdom and Canada.

Communications.

The easiest communication is by water along the coast. There is regular communication once a week alternately with New Orleans and Mobile, weekly with Puerto Barrios and Puerto Cortes, monthly with New York and with Liverpool and Colon. There is also a tri-weekly mail and passenger service by the Canadian Government Merchant Marine with Jamaica, Bermuda, Bahamas and Canada. The usual length of the journey between England and British Honduras is 16 days, via the United States and about 21 days via Jamaica. Telegraphic communication with Europe is maintained by a land line to Consejo on the Hondo River, which connects, by a cable...
across the Hondo, with the Mexican Telegraph System through Payo Obispo in Yucatan (1911); and by radio-telegraphic communication with New Orleans (1918) and Jamaica (1928).

A telegraph and telephone line has also been constructed from Belize to the most southerly town of Punta Gorda, and another from Belize to the Cayo. A Radio-telegraph Station is situated in Belize.

A short railway leads from the town of Stann Creek, 25 miles inland, the first section of which was opened towards the end of 1908, and the second section in March, 1909. The line was practically completed in 1910, but extraordinary floods in 1911 carried away a couple of bridges, and did other damage, which have been replaced.

Rates of Postage.

| Letters. | Newspapers |
|----------|------------|
| Within the Colony | per 2 ozs. 2 cents, 1 cent per oz. or fraction of an oz. |
| To Canada and the B.W.I. generally | per oz. or fraction of an oz., 2 cents. |
| To the United Kingdom, British Possessions (except as above), Egypt and United States | per oz. 4 cents. 1 cent per subsequent oz. or fraction of an oz., 2 cents. |
| Elsewhere | 5 cents for first oz. and 3 cents for each subsequent oz. or fraction of an oz. |

Climate.

Though situated within the tropics, the climate is sub-tropical in character. The maximum shade temperature is 90°, the minimum 62°. The dew point in Belize, a seaport, is relatively high. Sea breezes prevail for the greater part of the year. The average rainfall during the past twenty years has been 81.48 inches per annum. From the middle of February to the middle of May is the dry season. For the rest of the year there is rain to some extent during every month, the heaviest rainfall being in the months of September, October and November, during which months about one-third of the total rain occurs.

Currency and Banking.

By Ordinance No. 31 of 1894, the currency was established on a gold basis, the United States gold dollar being adopted as the standard coin. Gold coins of the United States Mint are legal tender for the amounts of their respective denominations in standard dollars; also the British sovereign and half-sovereign for the amounts of $4.867 and $2.433 respectively. There is a local subsidiary currency of 50 cent, 25 cent, 10 cent, and 5 cent silver pieces, and a Government note issue of the following denominations: 1, 2, 5 and 10 dollars; a nickel bronze 5 cent piece and a bronze cent piece are also current. The legal tender in silver is unlimited, and in nickel or bronze, 50 cents. The Government Savings Bank, established in 1846 at Belize (with branches at Corozal, Orange Walk, Stann Creek, Punta Gorda and the Cayo), had, on 31st March, 1928, $195,200.29.

On the 14th October, 1912, The Bank of British Honduras, Ltd., was bought over as a going concern by the Royal Bank of Canada. Banking business of every character is conducted.

Education.

The schools, both Secondary and Primary, are, with one or two exceptions, denominational. With few exceptions, all Primary schools are inspected and aided by the Colonial Government. Seventy-three received aid in 1927, to the extent of $65,501, with 7,218 scholars on the roll, and 5,623 average attendance. The total cost of Primary education for the year was $71,650.

The total number of pupils on the roll in all the schools was about 8,341, with an average attendance of 6,689.

A law "To provide for Compulsory Education in certain cases," was passed in January, 1915. It was intended chiefly for Indian towns and villages, but its scope has since been extended so as to include practically all school areas.

Population.

The population of the several Districts of the Colony, based on the census taken on the 24th April, 1921, was:

| District          | Population |
|-------------------|------------|
| Belize District   | 17,398     |
| Corozal District  | 6,756      |
| Orange Walk District | 5,607    |
| Stann Creek District | 4,850    |
| Toledo District   | 5,242      |
| Cayo District     | 5,464      |
| Total             | 45,317     |

Of the total population 39,734 were, at the date of the 1921 census, British subjects. Of this number, 279 were born in the United Kingdom. There were 167 Americans, of whom 155 were born in the United States, and 1,348 Mexicans who were all born in Mexico.

Population of towns at census of 1921: Belize, 12,661; Corozal, 2,079; Orange Walk, 1,175; Stann Creek, 2,577; Mullins River, 348; Punta Gorda, 926; Monkey River, 424; El Cayo, 1,237; Benque Viejo, 1,097.
