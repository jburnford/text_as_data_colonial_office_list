**THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.**

Situation, Area, and Trade.

The Windward Islands consist of the three islands of St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Grenada, lying in the order named from north to south, together with the smaller islands known as the Grenadines, which lie between St. Vincent and Grenada, and are attached partly to the one island and partly to the other. Geographically, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago belong to the group, and were formerly associated with it politically, Tobago from 1764 to 1783, and all three in 1838. The three first-named islands are grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the three Colonies is 524 square miles (about twice the size of Middlesex), and their estimated population at the census of 24th April, 1921, 162,254.

**History.**

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. Dominica was separated in 1771, St. Vincent in 1776, and in 1783 Tobago was ceded to the French. In 1838 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1835, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was subsequently united with Trinidad.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white and there are some Indian Coolies. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent. English is spoken throughout, but in St. Lucia, the prevailing language with the peasantry is a French patois. In Grenada the same condition obtains, but to a less extent.

**Constitution.**

Each island retains its own institutions, and, when the Governor is absent, is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature, nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. A Windward Islands Court of Appeal was set up in 1850 (13 & 14 Vict. c. 15), and abolished in 1920 by an Act (9 & 10 Geo. V. c. 47), which set up a Court of Appeal for the West Indies, consisting of the chief justices of the several West India Islands except Jamaica. There is also a common audit system instituted in 1889.

**Currency and Banking.**

The legal tender currency is British sterling and the gold coins of the United States. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada, which have branches in the larger islands, issue five-dollar notes. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

**Communications.**

The usual length of the voyage from England to Grenada is about 14 days.

The steamers of Harrison Direct Line call at Grenada on the outward voyage, and on the homeward voyage they call at the three islands as cargo offers. There is also direct fortnightly communication between Grenada and New York by the steamers of the Furness, Withy Line. The passenger and cargo steamers of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine call regularly at Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and connect these islands with Canada, St. John and Halifax being the ports of arrival and departure there.

There are no railways in any of the islands. A general telephone system exists throughout the islands. All three islands of the group are in
communication with Europe, the United States, Canada, and the other West Indian islands by wireless, operated by the Pacific Cable Board, and by the Cables of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company Ltd. The rate per word for telegrams to the United Kingdom from Grenada, St. Lucia and St. Vincent is 2s. 4d. The rate to Europe varies from 3s. 2½d. to 3s. 7½d. per word. (Government messages pay half rates.) There are also cheap rates at half and quarter of the ordinary tariff, the latter being subject to a minimum charge.

A wireless installation has been erected at Carriacou by the local Government. It communicates with Grenada and through that island to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, &c., the ordinary tariff being 2d. per word more than from Grenada.
