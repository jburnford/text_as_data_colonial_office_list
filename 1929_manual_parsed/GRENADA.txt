GRENA DA.

Situation, Area, &c.

Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward group, is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 20' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 133 square miles (about half the size of Middlesex). It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and about 90 miles north of Trinidad, and between it and the former island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, attached partly to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 8,467 acres, and a population (at 24th April, 1921) of 7,104.

General Description.

Grenada is mountainous and very picturesque, its ridges of hills being covered with trees and brushwood. The mountains are chiefly volcanic, and have several lofty peaks, the highest of which is Mount St. Catherine, 2,749 feet, running off in spurs from the centre of the island, giving it an appearance of romantic beauty when viewed from the sea.

The island abounds in streams, and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,749 feet above the level of the sea, and 7 miles from the town of St. George, and Lake Antoine, both old cratera, are among the most remarkable natural curiosities; near the former a sanatorium is established. The roads of the colony are in excellent condition, and are kept in a state of thorough repair. About 140 miles of main roads, and a network of byways (303 miles), provide good inland communication. The island is divided into six districts or parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John—while the dependencies of Carriacou, Petit Martinique and other adjacent islets form a separate district, administered by a Commissioner. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry for shipping and had on 31st December, 1927, 140 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 2,473 tons; its fine harbour, owing to its situation, healthiness, and great natural advantages, including a plentiful supply of water of the purest quality, offers exceptional inducements as a port of call and coaling station for steamers. The town had a population of 4,629 by census of 24th April, 1921.

The other towns in the colony are Goyave (or Charlotte Town), Victoria (or Grand Pauvre), Sauteurs; Grenville (or La Baye); and Hillsborough, in Carriacou. English is universally spoken, but the peasantry speak among themselves a French patois. About two per cent are of European blood, the remainder being of the Negro race, except the East Indian population, which was 181 in number according to the census of 1921.

Climate.

The climate in the dry season is delightful. In the wet season, as in all other tropical islands, it is...
damp and hot. But for six winter months, say from December to May, it is excellent, and is healthy at all times. The average annual rainfall at St. George's for the 30 years, 1898-1927, is 72·79 inches and the highest and lowest readings of the thermometer for the last five years are 87·0° and 70·0° respectively, the average mean temperature being 80·0° in the shade. The rainfall in other parts of the island is much greater; at the Grand Etang, in 1927, it was 140·47 inches.

Industry.

The prosperity of the island, like that of its neighbours, depends almost entirely upon the planting industry. It has long ceased to be a sugar-producing colony. The chief produce of Grenada is cocoa, of which a total value of 305,640L was shipped in 1927. Attention has been turned with some success to the cultivation of other economic plants, such, for instance, as rubber, limes, coffee, kola nut, cloves, vanilla, pepper, cardamoms, coconuts, etc. Nutmeg cultivation occupies a prominent position. The value of spices exported in 1927 was 162,766L. In Carriacou cotton is the staple product, its cultivation having never been wholly abandoned there; the value exported in 1927 was with cotton seed, 18,850L. The cultivation of limes has now been successfully established in Carriacou, the exports of lime juice in 1927 amounting to 2,477L. Tropical fruits of almost every description and of the finest quality are fairly plentiful, and are shipped to the Barbados and Trinidad markets. The principal food resources are yams, sweet potatoes, taro, kush-kush, pigeon-peas, plantains, bananas, Indian corn, cassava, bread fruit, etc. Fresh meat is always obtainable, and the animals slaughtered for the purpose are reared in the island. An excellent oyster is obtained in Carriacou, and turtles and fresh fish are plentiful. The forests produce valuable timber, such as bullock wood, locust, mahogany, red and white cedar, galba, etc. Rum is manufactured for local consumption, the total number of proof gallons in 1927 being 44,446.

A whaling industry on modern lines was established in 1925, with a factory at Glovers Island off the south-west coast of Grenada. 102 whales were caught in 1925, during the season from January to the end of April, and 112,963 gallons of whale oil valued at £16,870 were exported. Later the factory was equipped for the manufacture of whale guano, and the season of 1926 resulted in 108,055 gallons whale oil valued at 14,271L, and 1,898 bags of manure to the value of 1,728L. Owing to unfavourable results whaling operations were discontinued in 1927.

The main imports are food-stuffs, textiles, timber for building purposes, and hardware.

The principal exports, besides those products already mentioned, are turtles and turtle-shell, hides and skins, fruit and poultry.

Total acreage of land, exclusive of Carriacou, 76,548; acreage of Carriacou, 8,467.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George's, established in 1881, and extended to the out districts in 1889, and on 31st December, 1927, the amount at credit of depositors was 44,423L.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus on 15th August, 1498, and was named by him Conception. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. A settlement was attempted in 1609 by a company of London merchants, but the colonists were so harassed by the Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French Company, and established a settlement at St. George's. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The Governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; and in 1762 it was surrendered to the British under Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French under the Count D'Estaing; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. In 1795-6 it was the scene of a rebellion against the British rule, instigated by the French Republic. The Lieut.-Governor and 47 other British subjects were massacred by the rebels, and the colony brought to the verge of ruin. In June, 1796, Sir Ralph Abercrombie suppressed the rising, and the ringleaders were executed.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established in regard to the African slaves, and this was followed in 1838 by their unconditional emancipation.

Constitution.

There was from 1786 a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 21 elected members.

Under an Act of 1866, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, composed of members of both branches of the Legislature. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

This constitution was remodelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100L a year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieut.-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a Bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict. c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and Crown Colony Government was established in December, 1877.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, and on 1st June, 1885, Grenada became the headquarters of the Government, which includes the colonies of St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

Until the 1st of December, 1924, the Legislative Council consisted of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown.
By an Order in Council dated 21st March, 1924, which came into operation on 1st December, 1924, a partly elective Legislative Council was constituted, consisting of the Governor, seven ex officio members, three nominated unofficial members and five elected members. The Island is divided into five electoral districts, each returning one elected member.

The Government is assisted in the internal administration by six semi-elective District Boards.

Education.

There are 58 elementary schools, 10 Government and 48 aided. These schools are of three classes, Infant, Lower Division and Combined, and the law also provides for a fourth class, Industrial schools. Head teachers of combined schools are paid from £60 to £150 per annum, according to their certificates of proficiency, and to the class of school. Bonuses are given them for long service or extra duties. Grants are also given by Government in aid of buildings, furniture and apparatus. The administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1926 the average attendance was 7,638 children, the number on the rolls being 12,605. There is a Government secondary school for boys, and three for girls which receive grants-in-aid from the general revenue.
